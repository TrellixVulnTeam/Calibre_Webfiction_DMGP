If you attended—that meant something. But not much. If attendance was a sign of complicity, then at least a quarter of Izril's nobility were guilty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they weren't. And dangerous as being publically known to be a member of the Circle of Thorns was—there were levels of commitment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Most nobles got an invitation from someone connected to the circle. And some had been part of the circle in decades past. For, you see, the Circle of Thorns was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; new.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was as old as the Five Families. As old as the flowers of Izril, and their millennia-old conquest of Izril. The Circle of Thorns was a reaction to the power of the Five Families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Few members of the Five Families ever joined the Circle of Thorns. Yet individuals were invited, and the Circle didn't necessarily &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the Five Families. Indeed, they had been known to move on behalf of the Five Families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Circle of Thorns was…a sign of objection. It was made of the nobility. 'Lesser' nobility, which included the likes of even Ieka Imariss. Anyone not of the original Five Families. And the Circle—as Lady Ieka understood it—was meant to censure those with too much power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Who watched the [Watchman]? Well…everyone. [Thieves], busybodies wanting to make sure they were being protected, fellow [Watchmen], his superiors, bored children, rabbits…the list went on and on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Who watched the nobility? Again, everyone. But who could hold them to account? So very few. Peasants? Hah. That was what War Golems were for, or private armies. Adventurers? Hardly likely. They were the labor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Izril had no monarchs. Or at least—it was famous for not having any. No [Kings], no [Emperors], no [Tyrants]. That was why the Five Families had colonized Izril. To get away from all that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But that meant a [Lord] was a class second to none. And to keep a powerful one in check like…Magnolia Reinhart, there had to be a group. A secret group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Circle of Thorns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In the past, the Circle was more public. It was a symbol of opposition, even a political group. Only in the last few hundred years has it become more…secretive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Ieka was hosting Lady Rie Valerund at her very comfortable mansion. Lady Rie inhaled as the cool, magically-chilled air kept out the summer's heat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were finally back at Ieka's estates. It had taken &lt;em&gt;some time&lt;/em&gt; for Ieka to return after the business with the Stitch Witch. She didn't have a magical coach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well—she had several, but none as fast as Magnolia. For anyone but Magnolia Reinhart, Tyrion Veltras, and a few others, travelling across Izril was a journey that took weeks. And Ieka was glad to be home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] Imarris reclined in a chair made out of Deguree Rabbits. Just…the rabbits. From their pelts to the cotton on their tail. It was stuffed with the oversized tails of the Deguree Rabbit, rumored to be one of the softest substances on in the world. And it felt &lt;em&gt;wonderful.&lt;/em&gt; Ieka sighed as Rie accepted a cup of wine and sipped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pardon me, Ieka, but I don't see the point of history. I am aware of the Circle's history."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Rie was…objectionable. Ieka opened one eye, annoyed. Rie Valerund, a lesser [Lady] whose family had been all but erased during the Goblin King's rampage and the Sacrifice of Roses—was distinctly below Lady Ieka's richness, prosperous lands, and magical ability as a [Mage Lady].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they were both members of the Circle of Thorns. And irksomely—Lady Rie was higher in rank than Ieka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;After a moment, Ieka dipped her head, graciously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, Rie. I was just remarking—we have been more overt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Reinharts drove us into hiding. Lady Suvelta Reinhart battled the Circle of Thorns. And lost. We curtailed her power, albeit at the need to hide. Later Reinharts have also fought our Circle. And lost."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rie's voice was calm. Ieka hesitated. Rie might know more of the history of their little group than Ieka. And the way she spoke—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Covertly, Ieka glanced about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sidel, another glass of wine for me. Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled at the young woman attending her. Sidel, a newly-made [Maid], blushed. She was new to her role, but Ieka had selected her. She had—a passion for women. One that was more acceptable in Wistram, when she had been a [Mage], but now was a…private interest. Lady Rie made no comment as a second glass of wine was brought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In many ways, Ieka was a revolutionary. She was a Wistram Academy graduate, a rarity in a first-born noble scion. And she believed in magic. Like the Terland family, she had instituted a number of magical reforms in her lands, like self-drawing wells powered by magic. Ieka was a visionary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the Circle of Thorns was well in the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Suvelta. That was the Reinhart Vampire, yes? A terrible monster."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka swirled the wine in the glass she was given, drinking lightly. Rie raised one eyebrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was—cool. Few things riled her, in Ieka's experience with Rie. For all the indignities heaped upon her—having her mansion sacked by Goblins, serving this new [Emperor], of all things—she was very calculating. And willing to do anything for the circle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the thing. Ieka shifted as Rie took a sip of wine. Rie's gaze was very direct as she replied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A terrible monster. An immortal Vampire. With the ability to fight a Named Rank adventurer on even terms with her sheer…nature. And with &lt;em&gt;levels.&lt;/em&gt; She ruled Izril too long. But that is why the Circle is needed, Ieka. We killed her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka felt a slight chill at that. She had read the records. Publically—Lady Suvelta had been a long-lived monster. Few had known she was a Vampire even after her death; but her end had been the end of Vampires. But she had lived, and been a Vampire. With levels, as Rie said. They had been exterminated, the Vampires. Too dangerous to live. Suvelta might have ruled Izril like a new [Queen] for…forever; that had been her ambition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the Circle of Thorns in her era had been…powerful. They had fought against the Reinhart's power from the shadows. And when they killed Suvelta, they had done it to send a message. Suvelta Reinhart had died screaming in the sunlight, tortured for sixteen days and nights before she died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the Circle of Thorns. But that was the one Ieka knew. The past Circles had been dangerous, as the circumstances dictated. A few iterations of her group had fought back invasions from Chandrar and Baleros. They had humbled Khelt when it invaded—thrown back the Six Great Companies of Baleros two thousand years back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They waned and grew as the era demanded. Sometimes they were protectors, other times watchers. Mostly—useless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Circle of Thorns. If you were offered an invitation, especially six years ago, it would have been to a small group of nobles like you where you could eat good food, complain about annoying nobles (assuming they weren't in the room with you), and relax. It was a &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; thing, a little reminder to the Five Families that they weren't unopposed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this new Circle was…different. More like the old times. Lady Rie fished out the Thorn of Speaking from some secret compartment on her person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Circle awaits, Lady Ieka. Will you join the Petals of Death?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka nearly laughed at Rie's terms for the inner council. Not the petty outside, with all their pretensions at being part of 'the Circle of Thorns'. But the real movers and shakers. The…scary ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hesitated, and took another sip of her wine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. I…hope you will prompt me on what to do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rie gave Ieka a look. Neither one was part of the Petals of Death. But Rie was second only to them—one of their agents. She had the authority to listen, even recommend to the Circle what to do. Ieka was a member of the Thorns of Contempt. Which was—two ranks up from someone who's just been introduced to the Circle. Powerful. Able to ask for…favors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like now. Rie took the carefully-sculpted flower made of glass and magic. She was no [Mage] and probably couldn't even see the enchantments woven into it. Ieka, as a graduate [Mage], could. It was an old artifact. And one with—requirements. It was a special kind of magic, one that had a tenuous relationship with the law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood magic.&lt;/em&gt; Ieka saw Rie delicately run the glass flower down her hand. The razor-sharp thorns opened her skin in a moment. She made a sound; her blood ran across the glass rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the blood twisted and changed. Ieka saw it seeping into the rose; confirming Rie's allegiance. Opening a…gateway. Albeit for sound alone. And she heard a voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Traitor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka and Rie froze. But the voice wasn't directed towards them. It was…male. More than that Ieka couldn't tell; the spell scrambled the voice's intonations, tone, made it flat, dispassionate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magnolia Reinhart has betrayed the North. She has gone to the Drakes. It is beyond time to deal with her. She must be—removed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The time was one week ago. Only a few days since Magnolia Reinhart's dramatic entry to Liscor. Then—now—Lady Ieka felt the same boiling hatred towards Magnolia she always did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the speaker on the other end was dispassionate. So were the other voices. There were only…six. No, seven? Rie and Ieka listened, holding their tongues. There might be many agents of the Petals of Death. But only a select few were members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magnolia Reinhart is an asset. She is a high-level [Lady]. We do not kill assets, even problematic ones. She fought the Antinium twice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And she has compromised herself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A flat, female voice. It could have been anyone. Any [Lady] in Izril; entry to the Petals of Death wasn't based on sheer power, or Ieka would have been one already. It was loyalty. Commitment to the Circle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had changed from the organization of squabbling nobles Ieka remembered a decade ago. This Circle &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even if the Assassin's Guild was somewhat inefficient as a tool, they'd stolen it back from Magnolia. Murdered some of her fellow [Ladies]. In cold blood; that had bothered Ieka. But better to have the vipers on your side than against. Now, the Petals spoke over one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She is no longer an asset to the North. Clearly—she intends to ally with the Drakes. Her arrival at Liscor and Pallass exemplified that fact."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She may still be within reason. Killing her weakens us. And the Drakes and Antinium are a pressing threat. We could approach her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magnolia Reinhart is our enemy. She does not &lt;em&gt;bend.&lt;/em&gt; Not on this. Removal is more expedient."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; guard the North. If she is removed—who will guard her lands?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Silence, then. Ieka listened, heart pumping. Rie only had that inscrutable, polite look on her face. Her perfect guise. She looked so—trustworthy. But how many deeds had she undertaken for her masters? Ieka couldn't fathom. She…felt uncomfortable as she waved for the young [Maid] to refill her glass. Sidel did so, clumsily, and Ieka had cause to regret employing her as a [Maid]. But she'd been so taken…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had what some might call an 'unhealthy relationship' with her maids. In that many were lovers. Some were just competent, but Ieka was a…deviant. As Izril's people understood things. Certainly by Terandrian and Drake standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was one of the reasons she was part of the Circle of Thorns. They asked only loyalty. What you did with your own affairs was meaningless so long as it wasn't public. And Ieka &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to have her secret lovers. Her hatred of Magnolia Reinhart was another reason for her joining the Circle of course. She couldn't stand Magnolia. And that—her &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; maid, Ressa—who was so—so, &lt;em&gt;unflappable,&lt;/em&gt; especially since Ieka had tried to bribe her away from Magnolia for years for exorbitant sums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka was certain Magnolia and Ressa were in a relationship. But she couldn't prove that. And the Petals of Death didn't care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They…were cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If Magnolia Reinhart dies, she must &lt;em&gt;die.&lt;/em&gt; No examples. The Couriers made a fool of the Assassin's Guild."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Better that than the death of Couriers. The North must endure. The war between Ailendamus and the southern Kingdoms in Terandria—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If Ailendamus &lt;em&gt;wins&lt;/em&gt;, time to be concerned. The North should not move unwisely. Focus on Magnolia Reinhart. Does she die?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka listened. The Petals fell silent. The Circle of Thorns was meant to defend Izril. Only—from within as much from external forces. That was their &lt;em&gt;modus operandi. &lt;/em&gt;But in practice, it was self-interest as much as anything that moved the Petals. But killing Magnolia Reinhart?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Agreed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She dies."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is unwise. No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four out of the seven.&lt;/em&gt; Ieka felt a chill run down her spine. The last had not spoken—but he seldom did in her experience. She took a gulp of wine. Just like that, it was done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Track her movements. Have the Roots report in. The Guild of Assassins will ensure her end. No mistakes. No casual attempt. Death or destruction."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Roots. The Roots of Contempt—the group Rie was part of. Not just the nobility, but high-level agents the Circle employed. They had to be cautious, going up against a member of the Five Families. But the Circle of Thorns could be said to rival one of the Five Families in scope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She dies. But we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have an agent. If Reinhart dies—who leads the north?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A pause. Then—the male voice. The seventh. Possibly their leader. Ieka listened, noting the slight difference in speech pattern; no inflection or anything else. The magic made it impossible to detect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If Reinhart dies—choose Veltras. Approach Tyrion Veltras. With our support, he could take Liscor again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another pause. Then, voices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He has lost his wife, hates the Drakes. Sound opinion. I agree."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tyrion is stubborn. Disagree."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who else of the Five Families can lead publically? Agreement. The House of El has lost their ruler. Maviola El. Terland and Wellfar wane…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If Ulva Terland and Petria both lived—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They do not. She is shattered. Wellfar is too focused on the sea. Agree. So—Tyrion?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Approach him. Kill Reinhart. If Veltras refuses, we may need to raise one of our own to the level required. The Antinium must die. The Drakes must fall."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Petals of Death debated, but agreed. The vote was cast—five to two to reach out to Tyrion Veltras. Ieka listened, spellbound, but with words instead of magic. And then—the Petals spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rie Valerund and Ieka Imarris. You listen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt;. They knew. And they used her name without honorifics. She adjusted her posture, as if they could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Honored Petals. I am—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Petals of Death ignored her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Valerund. Is this [Emperor] Godart an ally or not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka's mouth snapped shut. Rie, calm as ever, replied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe so. I am working on him. But I have exposed none of our plans. He is—a singularly unique individual. I do not know where he hails from, or how he knows what he does. But I believe I am in his confidences. Give me time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We run short on time. Investigate. &lt;em&gt;Make him an offer. &lt;/em&gt;If he is unwilling to be an ally—settle it yourself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rie hesitated. But Ieka saw her gaze flicker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. It will be done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Petals of Death murmured. Two asked for plans of the trebuchets—Rie didn't have them. They ordered her to retrieve them regardless of this [Emperor]'s death or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;More power to the Circle. The conversation ended abruptly, voices ceasing to speak. Rie and Ieka sat there until the last was gone. And Ieka Imarris wondered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Circle of Thorn was dangerous. They killed without hesitation. This was like the same group that had slain Suvelta. Or—trying to be. Ieka had her doubts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There were many groups in Izril among the nobility. And the Circle, powerful and old though they may be, weren't the only ones. Ieka saw Rie straighten after the call ended. And Ieka, smiling, gestured towards her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, it seems we have our orders. None for me, but I am—&lt;em&gt;delighted&lt;/em&gt; to aid you in any way you need, Rie. Simply let me know. As for myself—I will wait for the Circle's orders. May I offer you refreshments? Rest? Or will you return to this, ah, Unseen Empire, at once?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rie smiled like a viper in Ieka's parlor, and the [Mage Lady] shivered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will return forthwith, Ieka. If you would be so gracious."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. And please—as I said, anything to help you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka stood. A bit unsteady with how much wine she'd imbibed. But Sidel swept back in. And Rie smiled at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sidel, that was. The [Maid] smiled uncertainly back. Rie, that low-level [Lady], that…agent of the Circle of Thorns, looked at Ieka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Circle appreciates your commitment, Ieka. However—we would prefer you quit your cabal with the other [Ladies] under your association. Ladies Bedai and Therris have refused our offers. We would appreciate you bringing them into our folds. Rather than your own personal mage-circle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka froze, choking on her mouthful of wine. How did they know about—? They'd been so &lt;em&gt;secure!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sidel's eyes were wide, uncomprehending. She didn't know about Ieka's &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; little circle of…allies. But Rie did. And the Circle was old. Not like Ieka's alliances. She smiled again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like a Demon wearing Human flesh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You may also wish to speak to Miss Sidel. As I understand it—she is in the employ of Wistram. Who know your tastes. Well, a number of factions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] politely indicated Sidel. The [Maid] turned white. She spun to run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Gracious Invitation]. Stay a moment. Lady Ieka surely has words for you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rie pointed. Sidel froze in place. She should have drawn a weapon. [Lady] Skills were too powerful outside of combat. Rie saw Sidel turn, then clasp her hands behind her back and bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am at Lady Ieka's disposal, Lady Rie."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A polite answer to Rie's Skill. Only Sidel's wide, rolling eyes betrayed the fear in her. Rie looked at Ieka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will take a carriage back. And leave you to the unpleasantness. My condolences, Ieka."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka Imarris, the [Mage Lady] who could blow a hole through an unenchanted castle's walls…felt a pit of cold in her stomach. She looked at Rie, and saw a true [Lady]. Someone who was as powerful in social circles, in the realms of intrigue and politics as a Named Rank [Mage] throwing [Siege Fireballs] around in a battlefield. She saw Rie tactfully make her way to the door. Ieka had no doubt she'd find her way back to Riverfarm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka looked at Sidel. The young woman—just &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;, beautifully orange of hair, almost similar to Terandrian hair coloration, and stunningly fit, in the prime of her life like Ieka liked in her lovers—trembled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Ieka, I only—I had to feed my family, and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I trusted you. I made you my personal [Maid]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka was still stunned by the revelation. If Sidel had been conscientious enough to deny Rie's allegations, Ieka might have even believed her. Sidel? A &lt;em&gt;spy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—Lady Ieka—I can—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I loved you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka Imarris whispered. Her eyes shimmered. With unshed tears. With magic. With betrayal. Sidel flinched. And as Lady Rie Valerund left—Lady Ieka Imarris was further pulled into that inner circle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Circle of Thorns. And their plans shaped Izril.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then—that was a week ago. And for all their machinations, they were just people. Powerful people, yes. But who sometimes forgot that they didn't control every part of the world. Didn't understand the hearts of…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still One Week Ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was indeed a funny thing. But when he was not the great rival of Magnolia Reinhart, the head of the Veltras family, terrible foe to his enemies—Tyrion Veltras presented few of the qualities that made him so hated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He stopped outside the keep that was his family's ancestral estate and looked up. The war stallion shifted underneath him, too well-trained to fidget. And for a moment, Tyrion Veltras just inhaled the fresh morning air. He closed his eyes. And reveled in the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion looked around. Across the grass was a tilting dummy. One of several set up on the open straightaway. He raised the lance he carried, almost a third hand. And the [Lord] rode at the dummy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Faster. &lt;em&gt;Faster.&lt;/em&gt; His stallion snorted and dug into the earth. Tyrion Veltras galloped forwards, accelerating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had started &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; times further than a regular [Knight] would away from the tilting dummies. But that was because his Skills afforded him incredible acceleration. And the max speed his mount could reach—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Was closer to lightning than man. The Lord Veltras rode faster, until he was a blur, moving faster than a horse and rider &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to. Towards the little training dummy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;If you had perfect eyes—you could see his target. A bouncing, little ring of wood. So light that the wind was blowing it, twirling the hoop of wood around. And it was that Tyrion rode at. His lance's tip bobbed, following the ring, steady despite the galloping horse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He struck forwards, bracing as he passed the training dummy. From his seat, Hethon Veltras, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Son of the Veltras name after his father, saw the [Lord] flick his lance tip up after he passed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The wooden ring was on it, of course. Tyrion Veltras slowed his mount, soothing it and rewarding it with a bit of sugar. He looked—pleased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As pleased as stone could look, that was. Tyrion was famous for not smiling. Or if he did—it was like a lion smiled. Unaccustomed to the feat. He rode back towards his audience and heard the applause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon Veltras, who was fourteen this summer, applauded politely for his father. Tyrion—regarded his son, perplexed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good strike, father."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon was thinner than his father. Less robust than the famed [Lord] who was, according to some lists, the second-best [Lord] in the world. Only—mentioning that would only make Tyrion unhappy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And indeed, perhaps that was because his son didn't know Tyrion any more than the Circle of Thorns. Tyrion leaned on his saddle horn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good strike, Hethon? Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sounded like a drillmaster. Hethon hesitated. And his compliment turned to confusion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You…got the ring, father. Isn't that hard?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Indeed, snagging the little ring with the tip of your lance at full-tilt was difficult. A master [Lancer] would train like that, but not at the speeds Tyrion could ride. But the [Lord] just shook his head, mystified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hethon Veltras. That is a warm-up. Save your compliments for true feats. A [Lord] should not be overly generous with their words."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young [Lord] turned red as his father gave him a stern look. He ducked his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. I just meant—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He didn't have words to finish that sentence. And it didn't help that Tyrion was clearly waiting for them. After a second, someone cleared his throat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps, Lord Veltras, the young Lord Hethon simply doesn't understand the difficulty of your true regimen. It would be instructive for him to watch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That comment came from an elderly man. Ullim, the [Majordomo] of the Veltras household. And—much like Ressa, a force as equally powerful within his domain. Although Ullim would not be the target of an unrequited Lady Ieka's affections. Maybe someone else's, but…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had been balding. And he was safely in his early sixties, white of hair—thanks to the expensive tonics he liked to buy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was his one vice. He'd buy [Alchemist]'s draughts to maintain his fraught hairline. And sometimes he was handsomely haired, like a white fox—or goat—other times, the potions backfired and he was stately in his baldness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Majordomo] had to be. He was composed as he patted Hethon reassuringly on the arm. Tyrion blinked. He looked at Ullim and nodded slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Most evidently, Ullim. Have you never seen me practice, Hethon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—um—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Lord Veltras. The last time might well have been a year ago. You were occupied with the Goblin Lord business. And you seldom tilt competitively in public."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Majordomo]'s voice was kindly. And he was like…a second father to Hethon. Not a mother. Perhaps an uncle, but never a mother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon's mother was dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras also respected Ullim's words. He nodded and abruptly reached for his bag of holding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will demonstrate, then. Hethon. Watch. What you just applauded was a basic [Lancer]'s training. But if you choose to pick up the lance, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what you should aspire to in training. Ullim, set up the magic targets. Battlefield lancework."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned. Ullim bowed and called out. A pair of [Workhands] rushed across the field. Hethon saw two young boys—nearly his age, maybe a year or two older—setting up a second dummy. Clearing the others off the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion on the other hand was dismounting. He quickly withdrew something from his bag of holding and began fastening it to his stallion, who snorted grumpily, knowing what was coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horse barding.&lt;/em&gt; And Tyrion himself was putting on a helmet. Just a helmet, with a visor. No breastplate or other armor; he was in his riding clothes for the morning. But the helmet was the very same armor he would put on for war. And he seldom wore that helmet. Hethon began to understand why as one of the [Workhands] shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Activating the dummy! Off the field!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He waved a magic wand linked to the dummy. And Tyrion turned as he mounted up. Hethon saw, about two thousand paces distant, a straw dummy planted into the green grass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes were beyond perfect. A gift from his mother's Skills. Hethon could actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the dummy. It was made of straw, like most dummies. But this one was…magical. It was armored in some kind of scale-covering and while it had a shield hanging from one arm—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shield was magical. It sprang to life and a pink-violet aura surrounded the target. The training dummy's face—which looked like a Drake's, however crudely—lit up. The two eye sockets blazed with pink magic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then—the training dummy began to &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt; magical arrows made of light at Tyrion, Ullim, and Hethon. The [Majordomo] and the young [Lordling] saw dozens of magical arrows blasting upwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Basic spells. Tier 1 spells. But dozens of them. They arced, curving towards them and Tyrion. Arrows made of sand, light, fire, stone—Hethon gaped until Ullim yanked him &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; the little bluff of grass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Veltras!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Majordomo] had a shield in one hand. He had been a [Retainer] once—a good one. And like Tyrion he had a bag of holding. Tyrion glanced at him. He raised his shield.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The training guide must sense you as combatants. Hold still, Ullim. This won't take long. [Barrier of Pride]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A stationary field appeared around Ullim and Hethon. Tyrion Veltras ignored the arrows &lt;em&gt;smashing&lt;/em&gt; into the golden barrier in the air. He narrowed his eyes at the magical training dummy. Then he leveled his lance and dug his heels into his horse's flanks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The stallion &lt;em&gt;shot&lt;/em&gt; forwards. Hethon had thought it had been going fast before, but now the horse flickered across the ground. Tyrion Veltras rode at the dummy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the magical spells &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; from the angry training dummy as if it was possessed by some angry ghost of vengeance. The long-distance hail turned into bursts of magical arrows, lances of light—all trying to strike at Tyrion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They weren't just illusions either. Tyrion kept his shield up, deflecting the magical spells, weaving his horse back and forth. He dodged underneath a beam of light, deflected a blast that made the air &lt;em&gt;ripple—&lt;/em&gt;Hethon watched him charging the enchanted target, forgetting the danger to himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ullim! Ullim, what is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is how your father trains, Lord Hethon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Old Ullim watched, fondly, as Tyrion closed. His shield was constantly moving, blocking attacks to him and his steed. But his lance was on-target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the magical shield around the training dummy's target—Hethon saw Tyrion point. His horse disappeared—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The training dummy's shield &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; into a shower of light particles as the [Lord]'s lance blasted through the protective wards. Tyrion put his lance up as his stallion, panting, turned and cantered about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time Hethon was applauding on his feet when his father came back. He stared at Tyrion Veltras. The [Lord] even allowed himself a small smile as he removed his helmet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not a bad performance. I'm in decent shape, Ullim. No strikes to me or Gelden."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He meant his horse. The [Majordomo] lowered the magical shield he carried as Tyrion's [Barrier of Pride] flickered out around them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A fine showing, sir. I'm sure Hethon is duly impressed. One might have hoped he would have been out of range. I will speak to the staff about putting him in danger."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His words gave both Tyrion and Hethon pause. The [Lord] blinked at Hethon and then looked at the distant dummy. Which had, frankly, put out enough firepower in a few seconds to vaporize Hethon twice over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wouldn't have let him come to harm. And you're more than capable of blocking those kinds of spells, Ullim."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion addressed Ullim stiffly. The [Majordomo] bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, sire. I was here, but age does take its toll, Lord Veltras."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wasn't afraid, father."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon added hurriedly. The [Lord] hesitated. He glanced at Hethon, but then looked at Ullim. He—listened to Ullim. And Miss Jericha, another of his retainers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Few others. After a second, Tyrion stiffly inclined his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hethon should begin learning to ride a horse and protect himself. He's—fourteen. He would have been a [Squire] already if he was a [Knight]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't quite a question. Ullim nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, sire. But we had discussed that it wasn't quite appropriate…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon fidgeted as his father looked him up and down. Not quite as a father might, but as a [Lord Commander] and one of the most powerful [Lords] in the world with his own personal army might. Appraisingly, seeking all of Hethon's weaknesses and finding them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scrawny, bookish. Not the reincarnation of Tyrion. Just—Hethon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As you say, Ullim. However, I have an abundance of time. Those Drake saboteurs have been dealt with. The realm is…at peace…for now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He leaned on his horse as he gazed about. The estates of Tyrion Veltras' lands were flush with nature. The keep rested next to a large forest—or part of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Vail Forest, one of the largest forests in all of Izril lay smack dab in Veltras lands. And you couldn't but ride anywhere without seeing part of it. The Veltras Keep, heavily fortified, as much a mansion as stronghold, lay next to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This tilting and training area was where Tyrion loved to be when he wasn't managing his estates or out attending to his affairs. As was so often the case. And this summer's day was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Father-son time. In theory. It had mostly been Tyrion showing Hethon his morning routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps it's time for a snack?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We had breakfast two hours ago."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion saw his [Majordomo] sigh. Ullim did his best, he really did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Young Hethon is a growing boy. Perhaps a few snacks might not go amiss? There's some wonderful sugar-coated walnuts from Baleros, milord."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] frowned. &lt;em&gt;'It's a waste of money and I ate a fulfilling breakfast'.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;Was what he didn't say. Mainly because he caught Ullim's meaningful look. The [Lord] paused again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Very well. Hethon, have a snack. Then you can try tilting at the dummies."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He rode off, waving at the [Workhands] to reset the magical dummy. Hethon watched longingly as his father rode at the dummy, dodging the flashes of light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ullim. Am I bothering my father?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spoke plaintively as the [Majordomo] had a [Servant] bring some of the candied nuts. Hethon helped himself as Ullim, fussing as was his wont, made Hethon eat them off a handkerchief in one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all, Lord Hethon. Your father is just—unaccustomed to your presence. But he's made time, and he is doing his best. He simply doesn't know—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old man hesitated. His face wrinkled up as he realized he'd gone too far. And Hethon finished his sentence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Know me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at the old man. Ullim's hands shook as he gently wiped at a bit of grass stuck to Hethon's clothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You or Sammial, Lord Hethon. Lord Veltras doesn't know &lt;em&gt;children.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon frowned darkly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not a child. Sammial is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sammial was his ten year-old brother. He was on a ride with Jericha. Ullim bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Or young folk such as yourself, excuse me, Lord Hethon. Lord Tyrion is a [Commander] as much as a [Lord]. He's…doing his best. But your mother, Five Families honor her, was far better than Lord Tyrion."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon went quiet. He nodded slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mother was."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim nodded anxiously. He looked at Tyrion as he struck the training dummy with a sound that reverberated and sent a distant group of goslings flying into the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She was a welcome influence on your father. The two were a fine pair. As fine as…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He trailed off. Hethon ate the candied walnuts, ignoring Ullim's look. He'd heard it all before. Salva Veltras was a blessing, the influence Tyrion needed; the two of them had been perfect. A power couple, even if Salva hadn't been as influential as Tyrion Veltras.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;If she had lived—Tyrion might have had the support of every noble in Izril by now. But she was dead. The Drakes had assassinated her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone knew that. It was old history. Hethon remembered his mother. So did Sammial. It hadn't been long ago. Four years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Four years. And Hethon, grown now, still talked to his father once in a blue moon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Done with the snack? Hethon, mount up. I will teach you to joust."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon and Ullim jumped. Tyrion cantered over, his horse happily munching on another lump of sugar. Hethon looked nervously at his father.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't ride quite right, father—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Veltras, Hethon is still starting his studies. He wasn't apprenticed like you were…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim looked worried. Tyrion Veltras had been born to warfare. Not only had he fought against Velan the Kind &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the Antinium, he was known as the most powerful martial [Lord] in existence—aside from perhaps Lord Hayvon, Lord Belchaus, and Lord Seagrass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion had been trained as a [Squire] when he was &lt;em&gt;nine.&lt;/em&gt; Hethon on the other hand…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ullim. Enough. Hethon can sit a horse, can't he?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion brushed aside his [Majordomo]'s worries this time. He motioned to Hethon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come here, Hethon. Quickly now. Gelden won't bite."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sounded impatient. But he always sounded impatient to anyone he spoke to. Brusque, the fancy word was. Hethon approached the massive stallion hesitantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Gelden was one of Tyrion's war horses, and he was trained to kill enemies in combat by kicking them hard enough to &lt;em&gt;break their necks.&lt;/em&gt; Just a fun fact Hethon was always aware of. And Gelden had been trained by a [Beast Master]; he gave Hethon a &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; as the boy approached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch it, kid. I could eat you. Just because your dad's making me give you a ride, doesn't mean we're friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the message Hethon felt the horse was giving him. But Tyrion just leaned down, grabbed Hethon's arm, and &lt;em&gt;pulled&lt;/em&gt; him up onto the saddle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There. You see?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon &lt;em&gt;gaped&lt;/em&gt; as the world changed around him. Suddenly, he was on Gelden's back. &lt;em&gt;High&lt;/em&gt; off the ground. Gelden was huge, and Hethon felt as though everything was smaller. He looked up—and his father, stern, serious, black hair goatee and clean-shaven elsewhere, was looking at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You look as though you haven't ridden a horse before. Has Ullim been stinting on your lessons?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young boy ducked his head. Worriedly, Ullim called up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Lord Veltras. But Lord Hethon has a number of…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lord Veltras blinked a few times at Ullim and Hethon's worried faces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That was a joke, Ullim."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two exhaled. Tyrion sighed. He looked at Hethon, sitting in front of him, and then nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Have you ever tilted, Hethon? I don't presume the [Tutors] have taught you that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, sir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon breathed. He looked at Tyrion's lance. Just wood—weighted perfectly to make Tyrion build muscle as he used it. And then—the [Lord] offered it to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here. Try lifting it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon grabbed the lance awkwardly. He tried to lift it, but even with both hands, it was impossible. Tyrion's lips quirked slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Too heavy? Then—Ullim, get me a long wooden pole."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A training lance, perhaps, sire?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Too heavy. Hethon will never manage it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can try—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion ignored his son. He grabbed a lance as one of the young [Workhands] rode towards him and tossed it to him. Well—lance was an overstatement. It was just a pole of wood. Hethon deflated as he looked at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't be ridiculous. You're not trained and you don't have Skills. Here. You can still hold it like a lance. Just so. Copy me. See?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briskly, like a drill instructor, Tyrion made Hethon copy his posture. The young man messed up three times, but Tyrion effortlessly corrected his posture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It feels—awkward."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's meant to. Don't hit Gelden in the head."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The horse ducked as Hethon tried to control the pole of wood. Even that was hard for him to manage; he'd never have done an actual practice lance, however light. Tyrion pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You hold it on the other side of Gelden's head. There, see? Now, try to keep it steady. Gelden—&lt;em&gt;tsek.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] gave a riding order. Gelden's ears perked up and he grudgingly trotted forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon felt as if a mountain were moving underneath him. But the horse was just trotting. It was &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; like the ponies and mares and geldings he'd ridden. Riding Gelden was riding an avalanche. And if he hit something?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The boy found himself smiling. And when he glanced up, he saw Tyrion was too. The [Lord] glanced down and his smile froze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you enjoying yourself?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon was trying to balance the lance. Tyrion showed him how to move with the horse to avoid it bobbing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't fight it. Anticipate the movements in the saddle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't—get it still—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's practice. No one holds a lance steady their first time. Just ride. We'll do one lap of the training fields. Mind your tongue or you'll bite it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was a common mistake most riders could make. If you chattered while riding and the horse came &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; hard, your teeth would snap together and possibly bite straight through your tongue. It didn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; happen. But it could.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] took Hethon around the training grounds, moving faster and faster. Hethon gaped as Gelden sped &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, outpacing the [Workhands] and [Hostlers] and so on who were allowed to try their hand at tilting and riding during their time off. He knew Tyrion was one of the fastest [Riders] in the world, especially among the [Lord] class. But to experience it—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is amazing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras was smiling again at his son's delight. He looked down, genuinely mystified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I didn't know you liked riding. Ullim didn't bring it up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't. But I like &lt;em&gt;this! &lt;/em&gt;How fast can you go? Do you ride this fast when you're in battle?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Faster. I can go three times as fast if I combine my Skills. For a few seconds. A lance is a proper [Knight]'s first weapon, Hethon. And a [Lord]'s. Gelden and I can dodge arrow fire, even lightning bolts. And few things stop an enchanted lance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not even that Great Goblin Chieftain? I heard—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon's teeth came together &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; on his tongue. He yelped and Tyrion slowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let me see. You're fine. No bleeding. Watch your tongue."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] stared at Hethon's tear-studded eyes from the pain, but Hethon just gulped and nodded, uttering no words of complaint. Which was the right thing to do. Tyrion ignored Hethon's tears as the boy furiously swiped at them. And continued, as if nothing had happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I did kill that…Goblin. A Great Goblin, I think they're classified as. I thought we killed all of them with that Goblin King. It wasn't a match for me, even if it hadn't been wounded. Even so—it killed a Gold-rank team. Goblins aren't to be underestimated, Hethon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you killed it? Yourself?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon tried to ignore the pain on his tongue. Ullim would give him a bit of healing potion. Tyrion glanced at him and nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing to be proud of. It was just duty, Hethon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt; it. By yourself!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon insisted. He was going to tell the other boys—[Lord]'s sons and [Ladies]—that he was allowed to socialize with the next time they met. He'd heard about it before of course, but now he could tell them he'd heard it from &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; father.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I won't hear you bragging of it, Hethon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion frowned absently. Hethon's face fell. Why did he have to understand what Hethon wanted &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; of all times?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was my duty. Not my pleasure. Duty compelled me to deal with the Goblin threat, Hethon. And Liscor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Suddenly, Tyrion was lecturing. Hethon sagged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A [Lord] does not gloat over their foes. Or boast, Hethon Veltras."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Father."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion looked at his son, who was suddenly not enjoying his ride. He cleared his throat, suddenly, uniquely, awkward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Tyrion Veltras would have preferred to be on the road, attending to some monster or on campaign. His son was…odd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not unwelcome. Just odd, to Tyrion. A strange animal who couldn't be tamed or reasoned with. Not a beast—but not yet a man. Hethon was moody, didn't take to his studies all the time even though he had a gift, and could be quite irrational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In short, he was a boy. As Ullim kept saying. But Tyrion didn't know if he'd been like that as a boy. In fact—he knew he hadn't been. He just didn't know what to say to Hethon, who was different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salva would have. But Tyrion looked at the boy—still too young to hold anything but the makeshift lance and felt…conflicted. He cleared his throat. Suddenly, he was uncomfortable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is our duty, Hethon. You understand why I rode against Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because you were going to take the city? You nearly did. That Magnolia Reinhart stopped you, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion frowned. First knowing about Tremborag and now this. Was Ullim telling his sons…? He shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not just that, Hethon. It was also part of duty. Duty informed both decisions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He saw his son glance up suspiciously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How was duty part of it, father?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion explained. This felt right. His father had given him this talk—it was past time Hethon heard it from him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Duty is a [Lord]'s task. We have duty. To our family, our house, to our people, and to the realm and then to our peers. Not necessarily in that order, Hethon. But duty informs each decision. Why did I rally against the Goblin Lord? Duty to the realm, yes. To protect those whom the Goblins would slaughter or rape. But that was also duty to our people, Hethon. And to you. If the Goblin Lord continued—you would have been spitted on their pikes, along with every boy in Izril. You see, it was duty to many things that made me combat his threat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon hesitated. Tyrion Veltras was also poor at speaking to children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But why did you go towards Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is more complex. That ties into my battles against the Drakes. They are our enemies. Our house has long opposed them. They make war with us, Humans, each year. They sent saboteurs, infiltrators against us. We are never at peace."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon nodded dutifully. Tyrion went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"However, that is a longstanding grudge between our species. I would be…less inclined to make war otherwise. The north has its own issues. However. My duty towards my family comes first. They killed your mother. For that alone, I should drown Izril in Drake blood."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He said it so calmly, unlike whenever he had to talk sensibly to Hethon—let &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; Sammial. That was easy. And it all made sense, like when his father had explained it to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Hethon just gave Tyrion a blank look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know, father. But why attack Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] hesitated. He leaned down and blinked a few times at his son.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because they killed Salva, Hethon. Was that not clear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I mean, yes. It was. But what did Liscor do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're a staging ground. Liscor is difficult to take and it makes establishing a foothold impossible so long as they exist. They can be reinforced quickly—but for the Antinium, they used to be impregnable. If you couldn't take the city in a week, the Walled Cities would have an army of three hundred thousand marching on Liscor. If we'd taken it, we'd be poised to venture further south…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon was nodding impatiently as Tyrion's mind spun across what &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have been but for Magnolia. His blood still boiled, thinking of her. Then his son raised one hand as Gelden trotted back towards Ullim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But father. What did the people of Liscor &lt;em&gt;do? &lt;/em&gt;They didn't kill mother. Why do they have to die?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] halted. Gelden pulled up. Hethon looked at his father. Tyrion Veltras hesitated. His talk with his father, which had been so clear and reassuring—had not gone like this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At last, he answered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing, Hethon. I doubt very much they were part of the plot to kill Salva—kill your mother. That was one of the Walled Cities.&lt;em&gt; Manus.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His fist clenched on his reins. Hethon looked at his father, uncertainly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then why did Liscor have to fall?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because they stand with our enemies, Hethon Veltras. It is not an honorable thing to say. But [Lords] are not [Knights]. I would have…spared the civilians if they surrendered. But a [Lord] is seldom kind. Do you…understand that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras looked down at his son. Hethon looked gravely up at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think I do, father."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] reached down. He clasped Hethon's shoulder. He'd seen Pellmia do that with his boy a few times. Hethon smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not like Tyrion at all. &lt;/em&gt;But somehow—Tyrion felt as though the talk had been as productive as he had once had with his father. He found himself smiling again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Veltras. We have Hethon's mare ready, if you two would like to ride—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim, steadfast Ullim, was already mounted on a destrier and leading a much smaller mare. The old man looked comical on the massive horse. But then—Ullim had ridden with Tyrion's father in times of war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No need."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion waved the horse away. Hethon and Ullim blinked, but Tyrion's son obediently began checking the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can jump down—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. You have the practice lance. I'll show you how to tilt. Unless you don't want to?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion frowned at Hethon. His son looked up, suddenly ecstatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Can I?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. Hasn't Ullim let you…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not that advanced yet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hrn. Well then. I'll teach you. Raise your lance, just like I showed you. Ullim! Set up the practice dummies. Rings—all but the magical ones."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, sire!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim rode off. Hethon looked alarmed as he saw the willow ring target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you think I can do that, father? Should I start with…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed with his free hand at the targets made of conventional targets. Tyrion smiled thinly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you afraid you'll miss the hoop target?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—don't think I can hit it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon replied truthfully. He looked up anxiously, waiting for condemnation or disapproval. But he didn't know his father very well. Four years had passed since Hethon's mother had died. And they were strangers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because Tyrion Veltras smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can hit it. I know you can. I'll use one Skill to help you aim. And I'll call out to you and manage the horse. You just focus on the hoop. Understand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me? But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you miss, we'll try again. Seasoned [Lancers] miss all the time on a windy day. But you should &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; rather than fear failure, Hethon Veltras."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The boy looked up at his father. And he felt a steady hand, like stone, guiding him, adjusting his grip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ullim, clear the field. Hethon is tilting at the hoop-target. Remember. It will jump as the wind blows. Anticipate, Hethon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"O-okay."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lordling] gulped. But his father was there. And he let go of Hethon's hand, but he was behind him, speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Gelden. Tsek!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The war horse began trotting, and then moved into a canter. Faster. Then—Tyrion whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Gelden. Sav! Sav!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The stallion heard the secret commands [Beast Tamers] liked to use and accelerated. Hethon yelped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Father—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Steady. You can do it. Don't bite your tongue. Now—aim. Feel the wind?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were shooting across the long training course as [Workhands], the staff of the mansion, Ullim, all watched. Veltras [Soldiers], staff, and more saw the [Lord] riding with his son sitting in front of him with the silly lance held in front of them. But they were moving at a full tilt, faster than most [Knights].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aim. [Peilspear Formation]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the [Lord] whispered a Skill. One that improved focus. He and his son rode, a formation of two. And he saw Hethon forget his fear, sit up, aiming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A breeze picked up as they charged. And the little yew hoop of wood danced like an insane butterfly, twirling, defying Hethon to strike it. Without a Skill, even Tyrion would have been hard-pressed to hit it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As the two charged, Tyrion watched with that perfect detachment. He looked around, feeling Gelden surging forwards, loving to just &lt;em&gt;run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sun was warm. The air refreshing. The Vail Forest's breeze brought the scent of nature to him. The [Lord] inhaled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They passed the training dummy. Tyrion slowed Gelden, although the warhorse needed little encouragement. He began speaking, absently. This was the hard part. What did he say to Hethon?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salva was so good at being…he wished she could have shared this day. He missed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A glorious summer's day. We can try again. Don't be discouraged; I don't think I would have hit it. Lancework is tricky. Practice and building the muscle for it are—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"F-father! Dad. Look! &lt;em&gt;Look!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras broke off from the tricky speech. He looked down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he saw a little wooden hoop on the end of the practice lance. It had snapped off the training dummy, as it was meant to. Hethon was pointing at it, wide-eyed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I did it! &lt;em&gt;See?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You did."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] was blank-faced. In his head he was…calculating the odds. Even with his formation Skill, an untested [Lord] with no applicable [Warrior] classes hitting something at that speed…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luck only went so far. There might be real talent there. Tyrion slowly dismounted from the horse. He walked to the end of Hethon's lance and took the hoop, inspected it for flaws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then he looked up. Hethon was beaming—but the smile fell away as he looked at his stern father, face unchanged. He was hesitating, checking himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You did use a Skill. I got lucky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. It wasn't luck."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras looked at his son. He tried to smile. But it wasn't what he did. He looked at Hethon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He didn't have his mother's eyes. He had Tyrion's father's eyes. A more angular nose, softer features. He didn't look like Salva. Or Tyrion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But here was Tyrion's son. The [Lord] reached out, and offered Hethon the little wooden hoop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Very well done, Hethon. You may have hidden talent as a lancer. Exemplary work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what he would have said to a [Soldier]. It wasn't enough. But Hethon's eyes lit up because even that was more than he got. He beamed as Ullim came over, waving the hoop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ullim! Did you &lt;em&gt;see?&lt;/em&gt; On my first try!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Tyrion heard applause. The Veltras folk were applauding the ecstatic young [Lordling]. They were laughing and cheering. Tyrion looked around, surprised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Veltras folk loved their [Lords] and [Ladies]. House Veltras had always been custodians of the land, of the forests, of their people. And Tyrion was a poor [Lord] in areas outside of war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But good enough in other ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Save the ring. It will be a trophy. Replace it on the training dummy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion instructed Ullim as he lifted Hethon out of the saddle. Ullim gave him a mildly exasperated look, as if there had been a question of it going back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Hethon was beaming. And he wanted to try tilting again. So up they went in the saddle. And they rode through that summer's day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras loved being outdoors. Riding, hawking, hunting, even fishing. It was in his blood. He paused, marveling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He hit the target six times out of ten. Even without my Skills."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] commented to Ullim. The [Majordomo] was beaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He might have a true talent, sire. His eyes &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; excellent. I'll ask the tutors to focus on it in his lessons."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can teach him myself. Assuming I'm here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion hesitated. Already tonight he had to go ride south. Sixty miles along the Vail Forest was an overactive Mothbear clan. Too far for most to ride quickly towards. But Tyrion Veltras could do it in a night with a small escort. He was faster than most law-enforcement and preferred hunting the monsters that attacked his people from the forests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sure Lord Hethon would love to learn from a master, if you have the time, sire."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim was looking at Tyrion hesitantly. The [Lord] thought of his commitments, grimaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then—came to a quick decision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll…make time. Tomorrow, at dawn—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Majordomo] shook his head. Tyrion hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Morning?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He got another look. Ullim was a perfect [Majordomo], not nearly as combative as Ressa or treacherous as the…unfortunate Sidel. But he could still get his point across with a single glance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Late morning?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps before lunch, sire?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine. Push back my meeting with the [Druids], then. I'll teach Hethon then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Most excellent, milord."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim bowed. Tyrion looked around. Hethon was speaking animatedly to a [Stablemaster] who was riding towards him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With one leg. And one-legged though he might be, but he rode his older mare with a grace Tyrion lacked. The [Lord] paused, then strode towards him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stablemaster Tell. I didn't think to see you about so soon. Can you ride? Rest, if not. Your work will wait for you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His voice was closer to a snap, which made Hethon jump. But Tell Hidam, the [Stablemaster], just grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trick is balancing, Lord Veltras. I'm all right. Those potions you had sent took any pain away. As for the rest—leg's gone. Back to work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He shrugged. Calm as could be. He hadn't been when they had to take off his leg. But then—the infection had gone too bad, and even the best [Healer] hadn't done much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you're unwell, rest. I won't have you falling out of the saddle and injuring yourself so soon after healing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion instructed Tell. The man just bowed in the saddle. His old mare whickered at Gelden. Fast as Tyrion's warhorse might be, even the [Lord] would hesitate to put all his money on a race against Tell Hidam and his mount, Daisystream. Well, until recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tell had lost a leg. And he'd never ride as surely as before. But he'd not lose his job in the Veltras estates. Few people were rich, unlike the Reinhart or Terland or Wellfar families who had coin to throw around. El and Veltras were poorer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But no one went hungry here, either. And they were not tossed away, as Terland was wont to do. Tyrion Veltras sighed as he looked at Hethon. Now—Salva would have…said…or done…? She was so good at being—kind. For all she could be a fiery as he. She had once told him he was like 'a rock carved out of Veltras pride and stubbornness, only not nearly as soft'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He missed her. But he looked at Hethon, still waving his trophy of the wooden ring about. And felt proud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tonight, we'll dine on Hethon's favorite dish. A treat. And allow him a pick of one of his books from the [Bookseller] whenever they next visit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion's announcement made Hethon's eyes light up. Ullim was smiling too. It was rare for Tyrion to reward anything, but the demonstration of martial competence had put him in an unusually good mood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps some of the gelato as well? That Terandrian dish? Pellmia prevailed on me to try it. Have some prepared, Ullim. For Sammial and Hethon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Majordomo] hesitated. His smile flickered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That might be trickier, sire. The trade war of Lady Reinhart has shut down most major trading routes. And while it isn't affecting &lt;em&gt;our lands&lt;/em&gt;—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion had not sent one of the black roses. But—funnily—the [Merchants] had some idea that he and Magnolia weren't exactly friends. Tyrion's brows snapped together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can't get it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At cost—sire—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] frowned darkly. He looked at Hethon and the boy held his breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For this? Get some. Hire a Courier if you have to. Hire—the Moonlight Rider. Tritel."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lord Veltras!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim beamed. It was unlike Tyrion &lt;em&gt;in the extreme.&lt;/em&gt; Except for hiring a horse-based Courier. That was like him. But Hethon was practically dancing with excitement. He couldn't &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; to tell the others. They'd all had ice cream—the young [Lords] and [Ladies] his age. But Tyrion had deemed it a waste until now. Hethon couldn't wait to tell Eliasor. She'd told him it had tasted like—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Oh. Hethon's glee faded a bit. He hadn't seen Eliasor in a few months. He might not, now. [Assassins] had killed her mother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A sobering thought for a moment. And then Hethon felt happy again. Tyrion was debating with Ullim about letting Hethon try the magical dummy—with Tyrion protecting him, of course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Milord, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don't hit the dummy unscathed!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim pointed accusatorially towards Tyrion's chest, where a magical bolt of energy had seared his clothing along his shoulder blade. Tyrion frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What about the flying target? Yes, if not the battlefield simulation—set up the jumping target. Hethon, I'll control Gelden. The goal is to learn how to hit a target while in the air—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As the training fields were buzzing and some of the [Workhands] were dragging out the dummy with wings attached—there was a commotion. Hethon, smiling and bouncing to try to impress his father again—heard a voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Crying loudly. Every head turned. Ullim's face fell. So did Hethon's. He recognized the voice. And the tantrum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the rider, carefully but swiftly escorting a young boy back towards them. Tyrion turned his head. And Hethon saw his younger brother, riding behind Jericha, Tyrion's [Aide], [Mage], and retainer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sammy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon saw Sammy, or Sammial Veltras, ten years old, screaming and howling with tears as Jericha rode him back. He was small for his age, but rather fit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Sammial. What's the matter?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim hurried towards Sammial. The [Lord] was bawling. Red-faced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was very much a kid compared to Hethon's distinguished &lt;em&gt;fourteen &lt;/em&gt;years of age. He cried a lot when he didn't get his way, threw tantrums—got mad—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But there was this for Sammial. He was…something. Hethon saw every head turn and people hastening to see what was wrong as Jericha, naturally grey-haired, tried to help Sammial down. He punched at her, enraged over something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The thing about Sammial was…the thing was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When people talk about Hethon, they said things like 'he's studious'.&lt;em&gt; Diligent, a bit quiet, but level-headed. A credit to his class, really. Interested in books, which is grand, isn't it? Knows when to listen, thoughtful—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When they were polite. Well—there wasn't much they said that was bad about Hethon. Or…so he thought, from eavesdropping on the servants. And that was well and good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Sammial. When they spoke of Sammial Veltras, they said only one thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's a Veltras born. Fiery as his mother. That Veltras rage in him, and command. A [Lord] of [Lords]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At ten years of age, Sammial Veltras had outstripped his brother in one thing. Not education, understanding his father, however slightly, control of his emotions, and certainly not knowing when to shut up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he had more &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt;. Sammial, age 10, already had an &lt;em&gt;aura.&lt;/em&gt; His will manifest, as Ullim had explained it to Hethon. Not necessarily a good thing; it was just that Sammial had the power to influence those around him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I hate you!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Unfortunately, it was a boy who had that power, not an adult. Well—it could be bad either way. But Sammial was screaming at Jericha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What happened?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion looked mystified. Shamefaced, his [Mage]-[Aide] bowed towards Tyrion. She was high-level, competent, as close to a babysitter as Ullim to Hethon. More than once Jericha had minded him. Hethon liked Jericha. So did Sammial—mostly. He usually suffered Jericha more than Ullim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not today. The young [Lord] was screaming in pain. He had blood dried around his mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We were riding, Lord Veltras. Lord Sammial—bit his tongue. Hard. I treated it, but he insisted—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sammial let out an ear-splitting wail as Ullim pried his jaws open. The [Majordomo] looked inside the mouth and &lt;em&gt;tsked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All healed already. Jericha healed you, Lord Sammial."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it &lt;em&gt;hurt!&lt;/em&gt; It was her fault!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sammy, you're not supposed to blabber and ride."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon was exasperated. Sammial &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; forgot. He'd probably asked Jericha to ride really fast like he liked and begun talking. Sammial sniffed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But she made me bite my tongue! It was a rock!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I jumped a small one, sire."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jericha was exceptionally embarrassed. Tyrion just blinked at her. He shook his head slightly, clearly totally uncomprehending the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sammial, you were warned. And you were &lt;em&gt;healed.&lt;/em&gt; Are you still feeling pain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! But it &lt;em&gt;hurt!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But the pain is gone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] saw Sammial grudgingly nod. He turned towards Jericha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't trouble yourself, Jericha. Clearly, Sammial is overwrought. Sammial Veltras. A [Lord] does not &lt;em&gt;whine.&lt;/em&gt; Calm yourself. And if you behave, I will let you joust—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hethon held his breath. He didn't know if he wanted Sammial to stop whining before Tyrion got mad—or if he didn't want Sammial to show him up. Sammial was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good with most athletic things. His [Fencer] instructor said he was a natural with a sword. Tyrion had actually considered making him a [Squire], but for his temperament.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Jousting?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sammial quieted, sniveling. Tyrion nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Jericha or I can have you ride while you tilt. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you stop complaining."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't want Jericha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sammial's response was sullen at once. Tyrion nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then, I will ride with you. Or Ullim. But you will first apologize to Jericha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even Jericha looked mystified. Tyrion's frown intensified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For striking her. She did nothing wrong. You were warned to watch yourself while riding."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ten-year-old boy glowered at his father. Tyrion blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You won't apologize to her?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I hate her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Sammial, I deeply apologize for the mistake. It won't happen again. Won't you let me ride with you? I will do my best."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jericha knelt, smiling at Sammial. He looked at her. And Hethon, hoping, praying though he didn't know how to—saw Sammial's eyes flash with rage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Shut up!&lt;/em&gt; I said, &lt;em&gt;I hate you!&lt;/em&gt; Go &lt;em&gt;away!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;You're not my mother! You're just a servant!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spat at Jericha. The [Mage] recoiled as Sammial got &lt;em&gt;angry.&lt;/em&gt; The same angry that would lead to him beating up someone five years older than he was—or attacking a feral dog with a stick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Veltras rage. Hethon even felt it in the air, a prickling, painful sensation. He flinched as Jericha drew back. But then—the feeling faded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cold oblivion pushed it back. Tyrion Veltras was &lt;em&gt;smoldering.&lt;/em&gt; And Veltras fury? Jericha, his second-in-command and Ullim both stood up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Veltras—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps Lord Sammial—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sammial Veltras.&lt;/em&gt; You will never speak to your people like that!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] snapped, his voice a battlefield roar. Sammial paled, his aura going out in front of the adult's. He turned to run back into the mansion. Tyrion caught him in three strides. He was of course, a lot faster even without a horse than a boy. Even one like Sammial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was fast. Tyrion grabbed Sammial, put him over one knee, and began to spank him. Hard. Sammial shouted with fury and then pain. Then he began crying and trying to punch his father.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras wasn't known for mercy. Nor—for spanking people lightly. Hethon flinched with every blow. By the end, Sammial was hanging on his father's knee, just crying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When Tyrion let go, Sammial somehow had the energy to stand up. He turned, crimson-faced, crying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I hate you! I wish you'd died too!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He screamed in his father's face. Then he ran, sobbing, into the mansion. Ullim ran after him. Lord Tyrion Veltras just stood there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Stone-faced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Veltras?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Father?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one knew what to say after that. Jericha, looking pale, approached Tyrion. So did Hethon. A moment ago—they had been so happy. But when Tyrion turned, his face was blank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Time to investigate the Mothbear attacks. I'll be back late, if at all tonight. Hethon. I will see you tomorrow. Jericha, my usual escort."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, sire."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jericha cast one agonized glance at Hethon. The boy stood there. He wanted to say—'no'. But if Tyrion stayed, with Sammial so upset—would the gelato even matter?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He stood with the little wooden ring in his hands, on that glorious summer's day. And it was a glorious day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tyrion Veltras felt it too. Such a beautiful day. He looked back at his son once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Hethon—was more of a stranger. A stranger who understood how his father worked. And Sammial? Not at all. And Tyrion didn't understand him at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ullim was a poor mother. Jericha was only Jericha. The boys lacked a mother. And Tyrion—preferred killing monsters to raising sons. One of those he was good at. One of those he could make a difference in doing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] rode away. He understood children not at all. He understood women only a bit more. But he had a duty. To some, he was a monster. To others, a symbol of humanity, at least on Izril.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undeniable truth to all though was that Tyrion Veltras was just a man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…Who was pretty bad with kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, A Week Ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At the exact same time, someone screamed. Happily. A little Drake girl pointed as every head turned. The children sitting around a table went wide-eyed. Then—an [Innkeeper] leapt out of the kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Happy Birthday, Mrsha!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice carefully waved the cake over her head and danced about. The children went crazy. Visma's jaw fell open as Erin Solstice brought over the carefully-frosted &lt;em&gt;chocolate&lt;/em&gt; cake to the table and put it down. Behind her came Bird holding a cold tub of strawberry ice cream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have brought the ice of cream. Please, celebrate me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was unnecessary instructions. The children were going nuts. Ekirra was practically vibrating &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of his chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hold on! &lt;em&gt;Hold on!&lt;/em&gt; No grabbing! Remember, I said there's an order to this? See the candles? We have to sing the song! Alright, everyone! &lt;em&gt;Happy birthday…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin began singing. The children and adults blinked, and then began trying to copy her. It was…about as bad as most renditions of happy birthday songs. In that—the bar was low enough that even untrained singers who didn't know the words couldn't lower it much further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay! Now blow out the candles, Mrsha! Try to get them all in one go. That's good luck. I think."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The little Gnoll bouncing in her seat with an imitation party-hat on her head eagerly &lt;em&gt;blew.&lt;/em&gt; The candles winked out. Erin cheered and people copied her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Good job! &lt;/em&gt;Oh, shoot! Make a wish! I mean, you should already have made a wish. &lt;em&gt;But don't tell anyone what it was!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She put a finger to Mrsha's mouth. The Gnoll's eyes went round and she closed her eyes, concentrating hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Dude. Do you think they actually think the wishes come true? This is nuts. How do they not have birthdays?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At a distant table, Kevin looked at the others. Rose sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kevin. They have birthdays. Just not &lt;em&gt;cake.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But the wishes…okay. Do we get cake?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Everyone gets cake! Who wants cake? And ice cream? You can have both!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wandering Inn was filled with hands. And Erin Solstice, beaming, began slicing the cake up into pieces. It was a special day, as the cake and bits of ice cream went around the room. Gnolls and Drakes and yes, a few other species, ate happily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a pile of gifts on one table. Erin was beaming as Lyonette gave Mrsha a little hug with the first slice of cake and ice cream she was doling out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was Mrsha's birthday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…And that was it. Mrsha's birthday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nothing else. No grand events in The Wandering Inn. No confluence of events—well—only a few—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But primarily, just a birthday for a special little Gnoll girl who savored her first bite of strawberry ice cream and chocolate cake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was perfect. But she &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; it would be, because she'd helped decide which flavor cake and ice cream to make. It had been a hard choice. But she was happy with this over lemon, vanilla, lime, carrot, mint, or the other inferior flavors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Especially carrot. &lt;em&gt;Hah!&lt;/em&gt; The only person sad about that was Hawk, who was attending with Selys near the back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course, Selys was there. And Rufelt and Lasica. And Moore—of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; he had to be there. And the Horns of Hammerad, and Griffon Hunt and Krshia and Elirr and Jasi and Wesle…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So many. It was a kind of event that only the door being in Invrisil could conjure. Somehow—all of Mrsha's friends, friends of the inn could make it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Except for Ryoka Griffin of course. But no one had spoken her name today. And Mrsha hadn't thought of Ryoka. She was too focused on the cake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Cake! Cake! Cake! Mom! Mooooom! Look! Cake! Can we take some back?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ekirra was drooling over this cake. He waved at his mother, a Gnoll. She was very embarrassed as she waved back. But Erin was laughing merrily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure! If there's leftovers! But you can come over and have more, Ekirra!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"On special occasions!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette hurriedly added. But this was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most special of occasions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello. I am Bird. Check my Bird Reviews section in the Liscorian Gazette. Have some ice cream. It is made of strawberries, not blood. Hello, I am Bird. Would you like some ice cream? I have opinions about birds."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An Antinium was helping pass out ice cream. At the same time, a Centaur was flicking plates of cake towards Erin with his fingers and levitating them around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Enough cake for everyone! Wait, didn't I serve you twice?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Palt narrowed his eyes at Relc. The Drake hid a plate behind his back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…No. I, uh, inhaled mine. Can I get another?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No extra servings, Relc! Except for Moore."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin passed out a huge chunk towards Moore and the Halfseekers. Jelaqua beamed as they received their cake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Maughin.&lt;/em&gt; Hold on, let me serve you. You're going to love this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bent over the Dullahans' head on the table and began to feed him the cake and ice cream. The Dullahan smiled as his body did the same to Jelaqua.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn made a sound like vomiting and moved away from the table. Moore sighed, but he was more beaming with happiness for Mrsha. The Drowned Man moved to another table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sup, Crab-boy?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Strongheart.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn acknowledged Wailant, Viceria, Garia, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Numbtongue and Octavia. It was…a likely group to sit together, really. If you thought about it. The Drowned Man slid into a chair and Wailant laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, this birthday idea, eh? At sea, we just get the bastard stinking drunk! I've heard of birthday gifts, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He eyed the table with presents. It was…a table with presents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As in, you needed the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; table for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the presents. Not one of those dinky tables either, but a proper, round table that you could eat your dinner off of. And not like 'oh, you could use a smaller table'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt; A &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; table, for an &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of presents. They had to be heaped up. It was the kind of birthday children across the world dreamed of. &lt;em&gt;Presents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because, obviously, Erin had invited everyone. And due to the nature of her guests—a lot of them were rich. There were…over…Wailant had to count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hold up. Halfseekers are 4, Horns make it 8. Griffon Hunt makes it 12—that's easy. Then you add that Garuda lady—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Bevussa. And that's Keldrass and his team."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right…plus those adventurers there. Silver-rank? Gold?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Silvers."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So there's over &lt;em&gt;thirty&lt;/em&gt; Gold-rank adventurers here. Plus Saliss of Lights. All who brought presents."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Yep."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn looked at Wailant. Both [Pirates] looked at the table full of presents. It was…tempting them. Mildly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Severely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that was just the &lt;em&gt;adventurers&lt;/em&gt;. Hawk shifted as he tried to copy Jelaqua. Selys brushed the fork away from her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can feed myself, Hawk!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She snapped. Hawk sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Isn't it cute, though?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Cute, and impractical. Where's my gift? Is it being squashed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. But Selys, don't you think it might be a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; too costly? Even if the other adventurers…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, I don't. This is Mrsha's birthday. She's been through a lot. Eat your cake, Hawk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it's not &lt;em&gt;carrot—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two began bickering quietly. Selys glared at Hawk and did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look at Pisces and the Horns of Hammerad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr was chanting as he bounced up and down in his seat. Yvlon sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can I get something other than cake and ice cream? It's just &lt;em&gt;sugar.&lt;/em&gt; I'd settle for those onion rings."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll take her cake."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria and Pisces both raised their hands. They began fighting for the slice of cake. Rather than…die…Lyonette let go and backed away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Adventurers. A half-Giant friend. A [Necromancer] fighting with a half-Elf over a piece of cake. Oh, yes, and the Antinium, the Black Tide of Izril, also sitting and politely eating ice cream since the cake did bad things to their digestions. A Hobgoblin sipping from a glass of milk while a giant Ashfire Bee sat on his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And amid this all—the ordinary parents. Ekirra's family, Visma's, and four other families sat in the inn. Visma's mother stared at Councilwoman Krshia and Councilmember Elirr, who had invited Hexel, the Lamia [Architect], to this gathering. Of course, they'd all brought gifts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ekirra's father coughed a few times. He eyed the Gnoll sitting next to him. He was relieved it wasn't a Selphid. After a moment of waiting for his cake to arrive, he spoke nervously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is our first time at a 'birthday party'. You must be friends of the inn, yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Felkhr, the Gnoll sitting next to him looked around blankly. He smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Yes. Actually—I'm only distantly related to this inn. I'm from Pallass, you see—the [Innkeeper], Miss Solstice was in the same bar during the Wyvern attack."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ekirra's father, Evink Silverfang, part of the Silverfang tribe, stared at Felkhr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The…Wyvern attack. And you are from &lt;em&gt;Pallass?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Actually, they call me the 'Flying Gnoll of Pallass', yes? I have this project—I'm trying to fly, so I jump off the walls—I haven't flown yet, but I haven't &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt; yet—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ekirra's parents stared at Felkhr. They slowly edged backwards as the Gnoll tried to explain. Across from him, Rufelt &lt;em&gt;sighed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;Felkhr. You have the worst way of introducing yourself. Ever. Pardon me. Rufelt, owner of Tails and Scales. And this is my lovely wife, Lasica…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Charmed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake smiled at the Gnoll couple. Ekirra's parents relaxed in the presence of sanity. Rufelt smiled as they shook hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, it is a delight. Are you a [Bartender]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am. And Lasica is a [Chef]. Not that she's practicing—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasica elbowed Rufelt in the side. He grunted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I mean to say—she doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to work, so why would she—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time she kicked him. Ekirra's parents edged away again. But then Ekirra's mother sniffed the air. She hesitated, and then smiled at Lasica, suddenly content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh!&lt;/em&gt; I see. Is it your first time?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasica hesitated. Then she smiled widely and leaned forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. And Rufelt's just being protective…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gnolls always are. Evink was the same way. You think this is bad, just wait until they're born. Evink once tried to chase off Guardsman Relc with a rolling pin…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did someone call?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Relc looked around, failed to spot the others, and went back to picking up a piece of cake that had fallen on the floor. Wing Commander Embria tried to pull him up while attempting to cast the [Invisibility] spell on them both out of sheer embarrassment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; early, but Gnoll cubs do grow fast. Yes, about…two months into? Progressing very fast. Isn't it…six months if it's a Gnoll? That's what my [Wet Nurse] tells me, but Pallass doesn't have as many Gnolls as…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, yes. Six months. I don't know how Humans and Drakes manage &lt;em&gt;nine—&lt;/em&gt;well, it can be ten for Drakes. And Centaurs? Have you even heard…? You used a fertility spell, obviously?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tweaked to allow cross-species pregnancies. Yes, I bought it from Wistram and they're very reliable. It was almost the first night. Well, I say, &lt;em&gt;almost,&lt;/em&gt; but…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasica and Ekirra's mother began gossiping. Rufelt and Evink shifted uncomfortably. Rufelt looked around at the other parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—you are all friends of Mrsha's, yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We—Ekirra knows Mrsha. They play together. And we were happy to attend this, 'birthday celebration'. But we had no idea it would be…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Evink waved a paw around weakly. Rufelt nodded. It was—something. The Wandering Inn could shock the uninitiated. And today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey! Do I know you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Saliss of Lights, Named Adventurer of Pallass, imposter in his body at times, and famous [Alchemist], stared at a table with two people sitting together. He was passing by with a pair of drinks for his table with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sulky Xif.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was also almost completely naked. And yes, in front of the kids. To make up for that, Saliss had consented to wearing a tiny little box around his groinal region. But only that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin of Pallass didn't blink twice at Saliss. He just sighed. Lady Pryde Ulta however, stared at the box. She stared at Saliss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am here to observe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, well feel free."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Saliss posed. Pryde stared at the box. She stared at Saliss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are you here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could ask you the same thing. I'm here because this party needed &lt;em&gt;class. &lt;/em&gt;My class. [Alchemist]. I thought you were banned."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Saliss winked at Pryde. Grimalkin sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're speaking on weight-lifting issues. Lady Pryde Ulta…refused to go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The [Innkeeper] is free to try to remove me. If she wants to start a fight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde ignored the glares she was getting from around the room. There was no Xrn or Klbkch—which was a small mercy—but Erin Solstice herself had not been happy about Pryde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;True to her nature, the [Lady of Pride] had refused to go and even insisted on being served cake. Which she would get.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Lyonette! Hurry up and spike that cake with the hot peppers and stuff!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The death-peppers for that Pryde-jerk!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin hissed at Lyonette as she kept serving cake. The [Princess] frowned as she scooped more ice cream and stared at the plate Erin was pointing at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That one? But I already gave you the hot-pepper one for Lady Pryde…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She and Erin looked at each other. Erin Solstice paled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh oh—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh dead gods, it's hot! Ancestors!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A shout came up from Keldrass' table. One of his teammates was screaming in agony. Keldrass and the other Drakes clustered around with Bevussa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not hot, it's cold! &lt;em&gt;You breathe fire, you idiot! Suck it up!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Keldrass bellowed at the Drake. Erin slowly edged over. But Palt smoothly flicked a finger and the plate with the deadly cake and ice cream vanished. The [Illusionist] winked at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's in the kitchen. If you want to pull a prank, you might as well ask an &lt;em&gt;expert. &lt;/em&gt;Here's a hint: don't use too many spices or that [Lady] will think you're trying to assassinate her. She's got to have at least one ring enchanted against poison."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned red. Lyonette breathed a sigh of relief and all was well—except for the stricken Drake. She was begging for water as her uncomprehending comrades mocked her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This cake is good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin amiably listened to the screams in the background as he watched the excited children eating. Because that was what this was about. Children. All these other perspectives?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Meaningless. Including Beza and Montressa eagerly listening into the Earther's conversation. They knew, of course. And they wanted the seven, oh yes. But a few things kept them from grabbing the Earthers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Politics. Palt being on Erin's side. The fact that Erin herself was 'not from Earth' as far as Wistram knew. Wanting to be on Erin's good side. Also—Erin threatening to send Saliss, Relc, and every Gold-rank team she knew after them if they tried a kidnapping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I need a drink. Can we do a chocolate liquor? I think—I need it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph stared at his shaking hand. He considered that he might…&lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have a problem. Rose ignored him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They are &lt;em&gt;so. Cute.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed at Mrsha. The Gnoll cub, who was fluffy, white-furred, and yes, very cute, had a birthday hat on her head. Conical, decorated with silver-painted stars. And she was busy licking a bit of frosting off Visma's cheek.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going to die. &lt;em&gt;Where's my iPhone?&lt;/em&gt; Ryoka &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to get it back to us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others agreed. Mrsha was cute. Another Gnoll who'd been invited trying to lick ice cream off of his nose was also cute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too much of the cutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Write that down, &lt;em&gt;write that down! &lt;/em&gt;We know this Ryoka exists. And she has all their devices?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa nudged Beza as they scribbled. The Minotauress [Spellscribe] was actually able to take down all the voices as they were happening; she wrote faster than they spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ice cream? Who am I missing? &lt;em&gt;Sit down, Relc!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here! If you please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wesle rose and gave an exaggerated bow. Erin laughed and hurried over. He and Griffon Hunt were sitting together. Halrac refused his cake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll have a Minotaur's Punch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Halrac! Not even one slice? Okay, then. How's some onion rings? Yes? Yes? Am I hearing a yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay! Great! &lt;em&gt;Imani! &lt;/em&gt;One order of—oh, I'm sorry!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin saw a girl &lt;em&gt;flinch&lt;/em&gt; from the kitchen. Imani, who was helping serve food mainly by getting the required dishes, was all flinch. Erin hurried over to apologize. Imani was in her good books. She felt really bad for Imani.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others? Leon and Troy were arguing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Look, it's not bestiality. That's only from our world. I'm not a furry. You're not a furry—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, hold on. I just said that—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin nearly walked into a wall and into the Garden of Sanctuary. She had problems. But for today at least—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is everything good over here? Sorry, I can chat after the rush calms down."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello, yes. Thank you for the…cake?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess], Lyonette, paused in front of Maviola's table. The [Lady] smiled up at her. And next to her, Olesm's cheeks were bulging. From onion rings. They were a new hit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is so good. Thanks for having us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was two days after Maviola and Olesm had entered into a meeting of the minds. Also, Maviola had moved into Olesm's apartment. For now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Liscorian Gazette was circulating the city and of course it was doing well. Bird happily sat in front of a crowd of awed Antinium including Pawn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Olesm asked me to write about Birds. And so I did. I have many opinions. You too may be part of the newspaper. But not my section. Olesm will add more sections, but my section is for me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So many perspectives. All tying together, like the Gentlemen Callers, who had decided today was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the day for a covert investigation, as it were. But they didn't matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because it was the children who mattered. Mrsha most of all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Okay! We have cake! We'll open presents later! But we get to play today! Who wants to play?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin strode over to the table with the kids. On a sugar-high, they all bounced up. Erin laughed. And she—was good with kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was how good. Erin Solstice raised one fist into the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Party! &lt;em&gt;Party! &lt;/em&gt;Let's go to the park!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the children went nuts. The [Innkeeper] ran down the hallway, arms flailing, and the birthday children rushed out after her. She had the same energy. She could incite children to madness, which, admittedly, wasn't a hard task. But Erin could be as fun as childhood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The children rushed after Erin, a responsible adult in theory, towards Liscor and the park. The adults remained behind, but the responsible &lt;em&gt;parents&lt;/em&gt; all ran after Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not because they didn't trust her. But because they…didn't trust her. Which even Erin would admit, was fair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The park of Liscor. A magical place with high swing sets, a fortress full of balance beams, little towers—all set in a natural park. Enchanted so that children falling from heights, as they loved to do, wouldn't die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a sign in front of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erin Solstice is banned from entry by order of the community and the Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] skidded to a stop in front of it. Ahead of her, parents or guardians were watching children play around the park. There were some dangers—the park couldn't stop kids who thought it was a &lt;em&gt;good idea&lt;/em&gt; to throw stones, or who got into fights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was safe. And all Erin Solstices were banned from it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because of a legendary day. The playground heard the screaming. And they saw Mrsha, Ekirra, Visma, and a half-dozen little Gnolls and Drakes running forwards, hepped up on ice cream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the [Innkeeper] read the sign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was banned. And Erin knew why. The panting parents following her were relieved as they saw Erin standing in front of the playground. Mrsha looked back over her shoulder and saw Erin standing there. The [Innkeeper] looked wistfully up at the playground. And the parents and children there turned to look at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh Ancestors, it's &lt;em&gt;her. &lt;/em&gt;Cessi! Come on! We're leaving!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Drake mother freaked out when she saw Erin. She had been there too. The Drake girl, who was twelve and clambering near the heights of the playground looked down and saw Erin. She raised a claw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Erin!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She shouted joyfully. Erin Solstice looked up. And she laughed. Mrsha waved urgently at Erin. It would be fun without her, but it would be &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; fun with her! And it was her birthday! Don't let the silly sign stop her!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin had visited the park once and been banned thereafter. It was not a story which the [Bards] sung of. But those who had been there remembered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the rumors had remained. Spreading among the free. The children looked down and saw the [Innkeeper] standing there. Erin Solstice carefully studied the sign as Ekirra's, Visma's, and the other parents sighed in relief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then she casually pulled the sign out of the ground and tossed it to one side. The adults froze. And the children saw the [Innkeeper] striding forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no. Call the Watch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone whispered. But it was too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice looked at the children. They looked at her, perched on the playground. Mrsha saw little Gnolls and Drakes poking their heads out of windows nearby. Even a pair of Human children frozen in their corner, looking at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman took a breath. Then she thrust one fist into the air. She shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Riot! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;RIOT!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the legend grew two sizes that day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ekirra got hurt while playing in the park,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaping about with childish glee;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Erin Solstice led the kids on a lark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sugar and riots, too much for me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As he ran wild, as he ran mad,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As he punched and bit and rolled in the dirt,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As he picked a fight and made Visma sad,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He got pretty hurt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…The point was that Ekirra got hurt. It was something you could predict. Especially if you were—anyone who knew kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;(Sugar + a park + the excitement of a birthday) * Erin Solstice = wild children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a simple equation, but incredibly, Erin herself hadn't envisioned the scenario that occurred. Which was again, Ekirra running about, growing increasingly more wild as he pushed children, even punched and kicked and &lt;em&gt;bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His parents shouting at him couldn't stop the excited Gnoll and after he'd &lt;em&gt;shoved &lt;/em&gt;Mrsha and Visma off the top of the playground twice, the little Drake had had enough. She scratched Ekirra on the face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hard. Drake claws were no joke. The howl of pain as Ekirra ran, bleeding, to his mother, cast a damper on the party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice stopped waving the little flag she'd made on top of the playground and the children stopped their battle to be on top of the playground with her. Mrsha's ears and tail drooped. Watch Captain Zevara and a squad of [Guards] saw Erin look around guiltily as Ekirra howled in pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara needed a drink. Ekirra needed a few drops of healing potion and Visma got scolded, which made &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; upset because it wasn't her fault that Ekirra was bad first! The two little friends began quarrelling, which made Mrsha upset because it was &lt;em&gt;her birthday &lt;/em&gt;and no one should be unhappy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. Uh—is he okay?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's fine, Miss Solstice. He gets hurt worse than this all the time. One time he ran onto a nail. And the [Healer] had a dreadful time with that…Ekirra, say sorry to Visma. Now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ekirra's mother reassured Erin. The [Innkeeper] was relieved, but her metaphorical fire was out. She couldn't exactly climb back onto the playground and start a riot again. Especially because Zevara was hovering behind her with a club not-quite-raised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think the children should go back to playing, Miss Solstice. By themselves, if they so choose."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin eyed Zevara. She looked at the club, and then at Ekirra, who was in no mood to play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. Sorry. Maybe I got them too hyped up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They went back to the inn, a bit subdued. Mrsha anxiously ran between Visma and Ekirra, trying to play the peacemaker. Still—all was not lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There were still the presents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Happy Birthday, Mrsha! This is from us!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns of Hammerad saw Mrsha's anxious face turn into a beaming smile as she opened her present and found…a tiny hunting horn! Wide-eyed, Mrsha blew into it and it emitted a &lt;em&gt;toot&lt;/em&gt; of sound. She took a breath and &lt;em&gt;blew&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Every Gnoll and most of the other adults clapped their hands over their ears. Typhenous, a master of dealing with children, instantly pointed and cast a [Silence] spell on the trumpet. Mrsha happily blew it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's just a small gift, but we thought it'd really help Mrsha if she wants to make sound. You know? And it's uh—a pun."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Oh. The &lt;em&gt;Horns of—&lt;/em&gt;that's hilarious!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin began chortling. Ceria grinned and Ksmvr opened his mandibles wide, but Pisces and Yvlon both looked embarrassed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I just got it! Dead gods, that's amazing!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Saliss sprayed his drink over Xif as he laughed. Relc nudged Embria and Jelaqua grinned—they were about the only people in the room who appreciated that level of humor. Mrsha ran about excitedly, but Lyonette had to call her back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There are more presents, Mrsha. Thank the Horns."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha hugged them all, and then the next present was placed before her. Erin eyed the…tower…of presents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whose is this? There's no nametag…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, that's me! Hawk and I bought it! Open it, Mrsha!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll opened the package Selys had wrapped and past the colorful paper she saw…a mirror.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A hand mirror, set with beautiful wood, that reflected Mrsha's face. The Gnoll blinked into it as some of the guests with an eye for quality &lt;em&gt;oohed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's so—fancy! Wow, Selys."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin blinked at the delicate tracing on the wood; someone had hand-burned lines onto the mirror, giving it a more Gnollish aesthetic without gemstones. But the glass on the mirror was perfect, without flaw, and it was enchanted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's more than that. Mrsha, I had this trick added. See that little bit of topaz near the top? Touch it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha did. Then she stared at her face in the mirror. A puzzled Mrsha stared back. But the face wasn't moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think she broke it. Oh dear."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr commented. Selys laughed. Mrsha waved the mirror, fascinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—it takes an image of what was reflected, see? Just one. If you touch the topaz again—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha saw the mirror begin reflecting normally. She looked up, ecstatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I was also thinking of Mrsha—this way she can &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; you what she wants. Do you like it, Mrsha? There's also some fur dyes here—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was in fact, fur dyes, little cheap bits of gemstones you could add to your fur and make it sparkly—Gnollish beauty products. Mrsha heard murmuring and Visma &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at the lineup of makeup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wow, Selys. This is amazing. Really."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was blown away. It must have cost at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; a few hundred gold. Especially for an enchanted mirror! But Selys waved it away. She leaned over as Mrsha took a picture of Ceria making a face and then ran around showing everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It wasn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; expensive. And its Mrsha's first birthday here. To tell you the truth, I was going to get a scrying mirror, but Hawk said it might be too much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbit Beastkin rolled his eyes, looking a bit…he smiled when Selys glanced at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, no. The mirror was a great gift, Selys. Just…great. To buy for a child. She shouldn't take it out of the inn. Thieves and stuff…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He coughed as Selys narrowed her eyes. Erin found herself agreeing with Hawk. It was so expensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha! We have more gifts! You can play with it later! Who's next?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Relc shouted. He had a clumsily wrapped gift—a wire puzzle. But Wailant and Viceria wanted Mrsha to open &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; present, which was a miniature set of [Farmer]'s tools. Oh, and Griffon Hunt had bought Mrsha a little bow and arrows which was a dubious present if you considered…aim…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bird had wrapped up his favorite feathers, Numbtongue had found a large nugget of silver and Pyrite had turned it into a perfect ball you could roll about. And at this point, Erin Solstice realized…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Selys hadn't broken the bank. She'd just set the bar and some of the gifts were nudging it. Like a potion from Saliss of Lights that made small little Gnolls &lt;em&gt;glow in the dark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Actually, that was a thoughtful, price-restricted gift. Numbtongue on the other hand…didn't really know what to give children, so the ball of silver was completely impractical in that it would be stolen anywhere but the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha loved it, of course, but there were &lt;em&gt;so many gifts.&lt;/em&gt; Each one of the Halfseekers had gotten Mrsha a gift rather than going by team. Krshia, Elirr, Raekea, every Gnoll invited had a gift. All the children had brought gifts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A. Pile. Of. Gifts. On the table. Mrsha had to begin opening them and quickly hugging the people who had gifted them rather than take the time to process each one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the other children &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at the gifts. Birthdays were a thing in this world. But the tradition of &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to give a gift was new; a child could expect a new ball, like Ekirra got for his birthday from his parents. Nothing more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha had four new balls and counting, including the one made of silver. And Erin, watching the kid's faces, saw this next part coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I want a birthday like Mrsha!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Drake friends (not Visma), began shouting as he saw Mrsha blink at a small pile of savory dried meat snacks from Elirr. And how not? The Drake boy began stomping the floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I want &lt;em&gt;presents!&lt;/em&gt; I only got &lt;em&gt;one!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tiss! Be quiet!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mortified, his father hissed at him. But the little Drake was also in his hoarding phase and Mrsha's pile of gifts was triggering him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Frankly, most of the Drakes in the room and Typhenous, Seborn, Wailant, Pisces, and anyone with a thieving background were getting hot and bothered too. Erin looked around. She saw Ekirra staring at Mrsha's new balls. Mrsha was looking around, overwhelmed by the presents…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Visma! I saw that! Don't you dare!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The little Drake &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt;. She had Mrsha's new mirror behind her back. She instantly ran off with it. Her parents chased after her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh oh. I think…hey! Take five, everyone!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The room looked at Erin. Pryde was busy pouring a handful of gold coins into a bit of wrapping paper—she hadn't known about the party—and the children were either throwing tantrums or just pure jealous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Five what? Five eggs?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria looked around blankly. Erin sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Take a break! &lt;/em&gt;Lyonette, quick family meeting! Mrsha, why don't you uh—play ball in the Garden with everyone? We'll open the presents later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hustled Lyonette into the kitchen. Mrsha, somewhat relieved, grabbed one of the balls and waved at her friends. They followed her as the other guests looked at each other. The tantrum-throwing children, Mrsha's clear discomfort at being the recipient of &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;—was putting that uncomfortable smile on the faces of the guests. Jelaqua winced around hers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh oh. I think we got her too many presents. I told you we should have gone all in on one present, Moore. But you said—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ulinde&lt;/em&gt; said that. Don't put this on Moore."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn pointed at the Selphid who was sipping from a milkshake and vibrating slightly. Jelaqua blushed orange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Right. Er…we should have listened to you, Ulinde."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ulinde blushed, ducking her head. Moore just looked after Mrsha, playing awkwardly with the balls in the garden. Then he glanced at Erin as she slipped into the kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inside, Erin took a deep breath and looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think this party might be a bit—too—fancy. Mrsha shouldn't unwrap all those presents, especially in front of her friends. And we can't keep all of them! Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette stared at Erin. Numbtongue and Bird had come too since it was a family meeting. The Hobgoblin and Antinium scratched their heads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Why not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's so &lt;em&gt;much! &lt;/em&gt;Mrsha doesn't need all of it. I mean, the horn, the mirror—they're all &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; gifts. But she's got too much!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin explained to Numbtongue. The Hobgoblin nodded, snapping his fingers lightly with understanding. But Lyonette just folded her arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought it was fine. Perhaps the other children don't need to see &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the gifts being unwrapped, but it's appropriate. My birthday was like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice stared at Lyonette. The [Princess] didn't see the problem. Mainly because she was a [Princess] and Mrsha's mother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But motherhood, or rather, parenting, wasn't an easy game. Erin looked at Numbtongue and Bird. And got no help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin [Bard] was listening to Pyrite, who was informing him about spoiling children. But Goblins were bad at birthdays. A Goblin birthday present was getting to live another year, nothing else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Bird? He had been alive for two years, so he was technically younger than Mrsha. Lyonette clearly thought this was everything Mrsha deserved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So Erin had a moment of introspection. She closed her eyes. Thought about the badly-timed riot where Ekirra had gotten hurt, this minor debacle. Then she opened her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. I get it. We should have had a birthday party with twelve people, tops. It should have been &lt;em&gt;small. &lt;/em&gt;And a larger gathering without gifts later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at her. Erin looked about. Then sighed. She went out to salvage the party—mainly by delaying the gifts until later where Mrsha would thank everyone individually and putting the presents out of sight and out of mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hah. See that? I could've told her this idea was cracked in the head from the start. Too much gold turns even the most honest man at sea to a backstabbing traitor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wailant commented, highly amused by the entire affair. He eyed Mrsha. She was happy—but the emotions were mixed. Ekirra's injury, the presents—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't a bad birthday. Just not a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; one. Bittersweet, and still mostly sweet. Like chocolate. Viceria nodded; the two experienced parents were sharing that knowing feeling of superiority that made less-able parents want to throw a drink in their faces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin and Lyonette are new at being mothers. I'll have a talk with them about proper parenting later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The daughter sitting with her parents at their table turned and gave her parents a disgusted look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mom. Dad. &lt;/em&gt;I caught you two running around naked with Numbtongue just a few weeks ago!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her parents gave her a blank look. Wailant took a deep gulp of his ale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And? You're grown up now. This is obviously for children."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rufelt and Lasica were taking notes as well. Although, privately, Lasica didn't mind the amount of presents. Drakes and [Princesses] shared commonalities there. It was a lavish party. And even if that wasn't the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; party—the presents would remain even after the hubbub died down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Felkhr had gotten Mrsha a little flying top you could spin and then chase after. Grimalkin had gotten Mrsha a few kid-sized weights. Pisces was quite relieved he hadn't made that custom, miniature bone-pet. Yvlon and Ceria had talked him out of that one…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I say, Ratici. It seems there's a spot of bother about the party. Quite an amount of coin being represented in those presents. I hesitate to ask—but this is a special day for a young Gnoll lady. You wouldn't be tempted to spoil that, would you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan leaned against one side of the doorway in Invrisil, carefully lighting a pipe. Ratici gave Wilovan a deeply disturbed look as he adjusted his cap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wilovan, that may be the most wounding thing you've ever said. It may be that stealing from babies and children is easy, as it were said by my peers, but is it &lt;em&gt;honorable?&lt;/em&gt; I'd soon as cut one claw off."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I apologize deeply, Ratici. Just checking. Even the best of [Thieves] might be tempted by pickings such as that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, but a [Gentleman Thief]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I do regret my facetious comments. Let me buy you dinner to make up for it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That may soothe my wounded pride."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Huffily, Ratici adjusted his clothes. Wilovan nodded, eying the full inn. Then Drassi hurried over as a bawling Drake was carried off by his parents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry! No one in the inn—oh, it's you. Mister Wilovan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just taking our ease, Miss Drassi. By all means, change the door."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll tipped his hat at her. Drassi smiled gratefully as the parents carried their kid, the first casualty, out of the party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was Mrsha's birthday. Erin Solstice and Lyonette had done their best. But despite it all, that night, Mrsha would still end up bursting into tears over the overstimulation. It would be a minor bit of sadness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was still a mistake. Erin Solstice did indeed know the hearts of children. But knowing was different from parenting. Too much of a good thing was bad. Like sugar. Or water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Same Week Prior.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Children were screaming. Also, laughing. It was a lovely sound, full of innocence and delight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…If you thought about it. In reality, children playing sometimes sounded like Harpies shrieking. Children could be annoying. Snotty. Vicious, and thoughtless. They were animals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka Griffin knew that full well. She didn't—like—children. Not in the way a parent loved their kids. Ryoka, in her vague dreams about the future, had never envisioned having children. She could both remember being a kid and being a hellion to her parents and how she &lt;em&gt;felt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kids were not for her. She wasn't good with them. The young Asian woman had no predisposition to coo and adore children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey! Be &lt;em&gt;careful!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner's aggravated voice rang out across the walls of Reizmelt. Human [Guards] leaned on the battlements of the walls, chuckling as they saw Ryoka jogging after a gaggle of children. The boys and girls were screaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Playing, in the wind. The same glorious summer day was shining down on Ryoka's head. Warm—but the wind was blowing strong around her. Providing blessed cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There they were. Children, being blown about by the wind Ryoka had called for. They were &lt;em&gt;racing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Little boys and girls had stolen sheets or cloth and tied them into crude sails, attached them to wheelbarrows, handcarts, anything with wheels. And the wind was &lt;em&gt;pushing&lt;/em&gt; them around. A few kids had just tied parachutes to their backs and were being tossed around. The gusts of winds could actually pick up the lighter ones and carry them, wiggling, through the air, for a few feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were having fun. And it was all Ryoka's fault. The City Runner watched, anxiously, as a cart overburdened with six kids all balanced together went careening past her. The cart wobbled and Ryoka thrust a hand out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey! Too many people on that cart! Only—three! You'll get hurt!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The wind blowing the sail-cart lessened. The kids shouted obscenities and curses at Ryoka, but after a quick fight, three slithered off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Wind runner! Blow me! &lt;em&gt;I want to go high!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A kid with two parachutes was screaming on the walls. Ryoka turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no. Absolutely not! &lt;em&gt;Get off the walls!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've got him, Miss Wind Runner. Off you go, you brat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Guard] forced the disappointed child off the walls. Much to the relief of Ryoka and anyone who had suddenly had a vision of the kid dive-bombing off the walls and trusting the wind to save him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No jumping! No pushing! Don't run into each other!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wind Runner of Reizmelt bellowed at the children. And—amazingly—they obeyed. Mainly because &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; controlled the winds. Or—the winds listened to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a funny thing. Ryoka looked around, exasperated, trying to keep all the kids in her line of sight. She wasn't content to let them just play, even with her winds providing the entertainment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course, she had agreed to let them play. Which wasn't like Ryoka. But they always &lt;em&gt;begged&lt;/em&gt;. And—funnily—their parents had agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;None of the parents were even &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; their kids being blown about. They were at work, or relaxing, free from the burdens of parenthood. Which was funny. In Liscor, the parents wouldn't ever have abandoned their kids to the Crazy Human of Liscor's care, let alone her inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Reizmelt's parents had let the Wind Runner of Reizmelt take custody of their offspring for a few hours. Despite Ryoka liking kids a lot less than Erin. Perhaps—because Ryoka never took her eyes off the children. Much like a concerned parent, actually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she had to. Ryoka pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey you! Don't you dare throw that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A boy froze with a rock in one hand. He was aiming at a girl who'd passed him by on a little hand-made sailcart. He looked challengingly at Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Or what? Whatcha gonna do, Miss Runner?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was old enough to backchat adults. And his challenging look made Ryoka want to shout back. Something like—&lt;em&gt;'Or what? Throw that rock and I'll shove it into an orifice, you monstrous little shit.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But you couldn't shout that at kids. Nor could you play their game. Ryoka folded her arms and thought for a moment as the boy taunted her. Then she smiled evilly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't stop you. Go ahead if you &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;think you'll be safe. But I'm warning you: you'll make the wind angry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The boy from Reizmelt hesitated. He would have accepted Ryoka's threat to box his ears or lay him out with a punch as acceptable consequences. But this sounded like a…warning. He narrowed his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'll just make it do something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka widened her eyes innocently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Me? No, not me. I don't control it. I just persuade it to play nice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gestured. The boy felt a swirl of wind tugging at his clothes and the parachute tied to his waist by a rope. He weighed the odds that Ryoka was lying, and then tossed the rock down with a sigh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids.&lt;/em&gt; Ryoka sighed. She wasn't good with them. She jogged after a wailing girl in an overturned cart with a curse, already feeling for her healing potion. This was too dangerous. She never should have agreed to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And as Ryoka Griffin attended to the crying girl, healing her scratches with a few drops of healing potion, making her laugh as the wind blew her hair and cautioning her to be careful since the wind wasn't always &lt;em&gt;nice—&lt;/em&gt;she was being watched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Serafierre val Lischelle-Drakle thought it was funny. She lounged in the shadows of Reizmelt's wall, a thick hood over her head despite the heat. Ryoka Griffin didn't understand why kids liked her, or parents trusted her. But she was quite poor at looking at herself. Even worse than Fierre, who didn't appear in mirrors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Vampire girl watched as Ryoka found another kid whose foot was run over by a cart. She checked the foot, picked him up. He clung to her as she bore him back into the city. The children followed her; the wind followed Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm really sorry. His foot got run over—I don't think it's broken. Just bruised. I put some healing potion on it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka apologized to the parents as the kids played in the street. The wind caught a child about to &lt;em&gt;crash&lt;/em&gt; into a wall, blowing him backwards. The parent, a [Carpenter], laughed as she checked her son's foot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He gets worse all the time. Don't worry about it. Thank the Wind Runner, Thein!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks, Miss Runner."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The boy sniffed. Ryoka awkwardly waved at him. She turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay, that's all for today. One hour's all I can manage. Scram!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aw!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The children complained. But they obediently began packing up. Ryoka was exhausted. Kids made her so &lt;em&gt;tired&lt;/em&gt;. Still—she'd entertained them three times this week. She might have kept them entertained, but the injury with the cart and the boy's foot had rattled her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had a…thing about legs being run over. Ryoka shook her head. She turned, as a slim, short figure materialized out of a shadow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Done playing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pointed teeth grinned at her. Red eyes fixed on Ryoka's face. The City Runner wiped some sweat from her forehead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That would be a lot creepier if you were a tall, old man. With a cape."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked down at Fierre, who was a good head shorter than Ryoka. Well—Fierre was a bit short for the average woman's height. She &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; a lot younger than she was, which was twenty five. More like she was sixteen. And she was pale, covered in dark clothing—not exactly imposing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that what you think a proper Vampire is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Vampire girl had to look around before whispering at Ryoka. The City Runner grinned. Fierre was no Nosferatu, or Dracula. The two whispered as they went down the street, a soothing wind blowing at their backs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I mean, yes, I do imagine that sometimes. But I just meant if you were an old man watching me in the shadows, you'd be scarier, Vampire or not."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fair point. Although if it happened to me, I'd call that 'lunch'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two laughed merrily. The joke was that Fierre didn't drink Human blood and wouldn't ever call attention to herself that way—although she could probably turn any casual would-be assaulter into paste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, there was this…legend of a you-know-what who hunted other you-know-who's. He called himself Alucard. It was a great show—er—I mean, story."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka stumbled over her words as she tried to describe a &lt;em&gt;crossbow&lt;/em&gt;-wielding Vampire. Fierre wasn't impressed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Arrows are easy to dodge. Old Bamer once shot a bow at me for training and I could dodge the arrows."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How about bullets, then? &lt;/em&gt;But Ryoka didn't say that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How about that V—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bit back the word as they passed by an old [Alchemist], Miss Kelysta. The woman called out to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, Fierre! We have more of those damned herbs to grind. It's nasty, so wear your mask! And Miss Griffin, I have a delivery going by way of Invrisil. If you could get it started, I'll be so obliged."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Miss Kelysta! I'll be there tonight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll see about the delivery. No promises."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two young women called out to the [Alchemist]. Then they turned back to their conversation. Ryoka whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The half-&lt;em&gt;Vampire &lt;/em&gt;with the sword?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're making that up. There's no such thing as half-us. And why does he go around hunting other Vampires?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh—just the evil ones?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fierre considered it. She screwed up her face in thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…&lt;em&gt;Maybe.&lt;/em&gt; I doubt the half-Vampire story is real. But Old Bamer would know more. As for powers? Shapeshifting, regeneration—I totally believe that. Turning into—what did you say? A mass of monsters? That sounds like really &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; powers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it could happen?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awesome.&lt;/em&gt; Ryoka's inner imagination was going wild. Awesome and terrifying. Fierre shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's definitely not something any of us &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; can do. But the legends talk about…really impressive stuff. I'll ask when I go home. Bamer or my mother would know. They &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; talking about the old times."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What about your father?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That would be Himilt val Lischelle-Drakle. He was the most 'Vampire' of all Fierre's family, for all her mother &lt;em&gt;spoke vith the accvent &lt;/em&gt;and put on airs. But Himilt, a humble farmer and shepherd though he might be, made Ryoka &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; as though he was just pretending to be normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He scared her sometimes, but then—so could Fierre. But they were friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can ask him. But he never talks about the old days. He probably knows…something. You can try to get it out of him. Why don't you visit again?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fierre glanced at Ryoka slyly. The City Runner smiled crookedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe in another week. I'm not hungry for extra-rare meat yet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We cooked yours properly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Vampire girl scowled at Ryoka. The City Runner laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it was &lt;em&gt;all meat.&lt;/em&gt; Don't you have salads, even if you don't eat them? Also—there's nothing to drink."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have wine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your mom mixed blood into it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, right. Sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two laughed again. They were just hanging out. Talking about Vampire lore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not just that. But it was a shared interest. Actually, Fierre and Ryoka often talked about immortals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, Old Bamer says he &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; a Unicorn, once. While poaching."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? What happened?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It nearly killed him. Ran him through the chest. Unicorns are evil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get out of here. I thought—well, the lore is that they're peaceful. Virginal, you know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ryoka, they have a &lt;em&gt;stabbing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;horn&lt;/em&gt; on their heads. How peaceful do you think that is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay. But Pegasi—I found a bestiary that apparently has copies of actual illustrations of each creature. Let me show you the Unicorn. It's a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; drawing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right. Until they stab you through the stomach."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had reached an inn that stood mostly deserted in Reizmelt, despite it being such a bustling town on the way north to First Landing. The Huntress' Haven, run by Mad Madain was as always, mostly empty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the food was cheap, Madain himself was reasonable on his &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; days, and—Ryoka liked it here. She understood having a bad day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Griffin!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice rang out as Fierre and Ryoka entered the inn. Ryoka braced for Madain, but the voice was younger. Alber, the [Fistfighter], strode up to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was—usually—quiet. So much so that Ryoka hadn't spoken a word to him for two months. But she had gotten to know him recently, after an encounter. And Alber, while quiet to most, could be—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Intense. The [Fistfighter] had on his protective gloves. He barely nodded at Fierre as he bounced on the balls of his feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you free? I'm ready to spar and I want you to show me those hooks again. I've been doing them wrong the entire time but I'm noticing the difference."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—I have time. Fierre, I promised to help Alber. I forgot. Do you mind…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Vampire girl suppressed a grimace. She gave a toothless smile to Alber and Ryoka she didn't mean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have work later. Go ahead. I'll watch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grumpily, she saw Ryoka turn to Alber. The two immediately broke into a lingo as foreign as her and Ryoka talking about Vampires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So what's the problem?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's the motion. It's so compact. When I pivot like this—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alber demonstrated a hook from Ryoka's world, which did look incredibly compact. Ryoka was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know you've extended it, but you lose so much force. Let's find a space so I can show you—you keep pressing in. How's the fistfighting?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alber smiled tightly. He had a boxer's face. His ears and nose had both taken a lot of impacts. He made money challenging anyone to try and knock him down or last three minutes in the ring. He had been moving from city to city, but of late he had remained here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;To learn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm making a lot more money. Still can't knock down a Gold-rank. But I won money off an entire team of Silver-ranks. All six of them in a row."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fierre scoffed as she shadowed the two. She could do that. Grumpily, she watched Alber and Ryoka find an open space. The [Fistfighter] went through a boxer's workout he and Ryoka had worked on as Ryoka lifted some training mitts she'd had made. Alber punched as Ryoka set up the mitts. He panted after he took a break.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm feeling—faster. Your theory and the punches—I'm leveling. I've been running too. It really helps. I wouldn't have had the—endurance to take on all six a month ago."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, that's great. Okay, see the range of the hook? Like—that—&lt;em&gt;fuck.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka saw the hook coming and braced. But the impact still blew her hand wide. She shook her mitt out as Alber stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You okay?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. You just punch like someone &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; your weight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka looked at Alber. He would have been around the featherweight class—if he made the effort to hit the weight limit. As it was, he was probably around…super welterweight? Still, very light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he punched &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; and like someone in the heaviest weight classes. That wasn't a joke, either. Alber had [Fists of Iron] and he was leveling since working with Ryoka. She shivered. Someone who moved as fast as Alber and punched as hard as a heavyweight shouldn't exist. Even if he didn't have a sword, he was as dangerous as any [Warrior].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You could light me up in a second."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alber shook his head as he set up for another hook and Ryoka held the mitts up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're pretty good yourself. If you had my class—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pass. I'm not that good at fighting. I used to think I was good—until I picked a fight with a Minotaur."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Huh. They're good fighters. Beat one, once. I've lost to…thirty eight, though. Mostly on ports. Used to work around First Landing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You were at &lt;em&gt;First Landing?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fierre glanced up from imitating one of Alber's punches. She could copy him—but Ryoka refused to let her try sparring. She'd nearly broken Ryoka's wrist once. Alber shrugged. &lt;em&gt;Not a big deal. &lt;/em&gt;He was like that in everything but his passion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. It's good money, but there are too many high-level clients. I couldn't take the heat. Plus, it's too expensive. I'll head north once I hit Level 30. If I'd known how to do half these punches—check my jab?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure. Give me your best."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Serafierre watched Ryoka blocking the jabs, calling out to Alber. Then they stood around and commentated on their forms. Is the arm best like &lt;em&gt;this?&lt;/em&gt; What if they come at me like—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Vampire girl was yawning. But this too was one of Ryoka's passions. She only got interested when Alber tossed a spare set of gloves at Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's spar. Come on. You have to show me some of these techniques."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner tried to refuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not a good idea, Alber."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll hold back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka hesitated. But a gleam lit up her eyes. Condescension, even kindly, poked at her ego. Fierre grinned from the shadows as she saw Ryoka put on the gloves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You don't need to hold back that much. Okay. Three rounds. Don't break my jaw. I'll show you a new trick. It's not legal if we were in a more—organized fight, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alber and Fierre gave Ryoka a searching look. She sometimes did that. Ryoka would hint at…something. Fierre itched, trying to put that piece together. She was an Opener, an information broker, with fingers in a lot of pies in the underworld. But she had no idea where Ryoka was really from. Her best guess was—Terandria. Or a utopia. Perhaps Khelt. But Ryoka was cagey and refused to answer anything directly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At any rate, the sparring match was short. Fierre watched as Ryoka and Alber went at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a fairly good match if Alber held back a bit. He could indeed punch far harder than Ryoka, but she was quick and had done this before. They went back and forth, exchanging punches, keeping their guards up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At first they stopped when one of them saw something interesting, like Alber noting how useful the hook was as a block. But then Ryoka punched him straight through a gap in his guard. Alber's head rocked back as Fierre laughed, and they got a bit more—competitive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh shit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka hadn't made a mouth guard yet, so she was grateful to Alber for avoiding her head. But after her shot to his face, he came for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Ten Second Rush]. &lt;/em&gt;She knew the Skill and saw him coming at her. Ryoka put up her guard, but the punches began backing her up &lt;em&gt;hard.&lt;/em&gt; She hit a rope in the little ring they'd set up and swore internally. Then Alber threw a punch and caught her in the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka's guard went down. She felt one punch land straight on her solar plexus and felt everything go out of her. Another fist went for her face—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alber stopped the punch. Panting. The [Fistfighter] caught Ryoka before she stumbled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. Got carried away."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Told you—you could get me. Nice rush."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka panted. She saw Fierre watching her anxiously. She waved a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You done?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One more round. Let me try the trick. You're going to like this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alber nodded. He reset himself. Ryoka, wincing, thanked the stars she hadn't been hit on her liver—and that Alber wasn't punching as hard as he could. And he still couldn't beat Gold-ranks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ready?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ready."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ding!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fierre slapped the wall. The two shot towards each other. This time Ryoka came in fast. Alber had learned modern boxing theory well and he was practicing infighting. In that he would now stick to his opponents like glue until they wanted to die. Not that he hadn't been good already, but boxing theory from Ryoka's world had made him even more dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they had lots of tricks. And this wasn't boxing so much as &lt;em&gt;fistfighting&lt;/em&gt;. Which meant—Ryoka jabbed twice, watching Alber's guard go up. Then—she took a chance. She spun—and her body flashed around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her backhand caught the tip of Alber's chin as he jumped back. He wobbled, but Ryoka had missed. Alber swore, lowered his guard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What was that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Spinning backhand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Completely illegal in a boxing match due to the spin. But since this wasn't boxing, Alber could go for it. He watched as Ryoka demonstrated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Spinning kick, spinning backhand—you just love to twirl about, don't you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fierre commentated from the side. Ryoka and Alber both gave her looks of mild wrath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a good surprise move. And it could lay Alber out. Like I said, if we were just going pure boxing…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I get it. Let me try it, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka put up her gloves. Alber spun—missed completely. Fierre laughed herself off the barrel she'd been sitting on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sometimes Ryoka got the impression Fierre didn't quite &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; Alber. And Alber was distinctly…polite to Fierre. They were distant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Alber was a new friend. Since the events with the Earthers at Magnolia's mansion, in fact. He loved only one thing, which was boxing, or his version of it. But Ryoka was happy with that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good workout."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wiped sweat from her brow. Alber nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll let you know how the hook goes. And the spinning. I'll try it out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was all warmed up and ready to beat down some poor travellers who thought they could knock Alber down. Ryoka felt sorry for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She sighed, shaking out her limbs. Fierre slipped off her barrel. She avoided a patch of sun as she stuck to the sides of Madain's inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You free?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought you were going to help Miss Kelysta with the grinding."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, &lt;em&gt;damn.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fierre grimaced. Ryoka glanced sideways at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You don't need to anymore, though. Right? I thought the information business was doing really well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Vampire grinned at Ryoka with the toothy smile she'd only give her friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Better than ever. But Kelystra's old and she makes those poisons for adventurers. Anyone but me gets really sick. Anyways, she's good for information."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka nodded. She walked with Fierre out of the courtyard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Poison doesn't get you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Most&lt;/em&gt; poison. In exchange, I can't do garlic, silver, and light."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pretty good trade, except for that light stuff. Okay, I'll see you later. Maybe tonight. I'm just doing local runs. Won't be long, but I might get caught out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure. Show me that book later?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka promised Fierre with a smile. And the Vampire girl smiled back. Perhaps—she only imagined Ryoka's smile turn to a clouded expression out of the corner of her eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner stood alone. Restlessly, Ryoka looked around. Then she went for a walk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Griffin! Hello! Thank you for minding the children!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did you see the latest on the scrying orb? That battle at sea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I need something run north. I don't suppose you're going that way…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a funny thing. Ryoka Griffin walked through Reizmelt. And people knew her. People smiled at her. Children liked her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hadn't gone on any major runs recently. Well—nothing like the one for Laken or Bethal. She made good money, but she'd been sticking around Reizmelt. Being properly Human.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Being…a friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka boxed with Alber, hung out with Fierre. She'd been to the van Lischelle household once for dinner, and thankfully not been part of the menu. She'd watched the battles at sea and kept up with the scrying orb news.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she had more friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ryoka! There you are!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The instant Ryoka entered the Adventurer's Guild, Mousey sat up. The Aldasian Warhound looked at Ryoka and Levil, Bram, Lamont, Tally, Keima, Ullica, and the other dog, Makki, who made up Pithfire Hounds waved at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I heard you arrived. Hey everyone. Hello, Mousey."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Awkwardly, Ryoka bent down and received a lick after Levil murmured the 'all safe' command. She had a bond with Mousey, whom she'd run with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With the Pithfire Hounds. In a way—Ryoka had saved their lives. It was…history. And they were continually grateful, for some reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's great to see you. Buy you a drink?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have to run later. I'll take some water."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Water for the boring City Runner!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tally shouted. The others laughed good-naturedly. Ryoka smiled. And for a little bit—she was content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We got work after we headed south. Fighting some stray Ogres. There were raids a while back—one of the bastards nearly kicked Makki. But we brought 'em down."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How dangerous was it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka leaned forwards. She was asking because it was a story, and also because she wanted to know. That was…what being a friend was. Levil twiddled his fingers and produced a miniature ball of flame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not bad. We fought a group of three. That's as much as I was willing to handle, but there weren't any huge gangs. Now, &lt;em&gt;forty&lt;/em&gt; and we're running for it. But Lady Ulta smashed one group and I heard some [Knights] did for another. Just good pay. I leveled, and so did Keima. You got our [Messages]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Congratulations! And—yep. Thanks for doing the escort mission. I know it was hard—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Pithfire Hounds all sighed. Ryoka grimaced. They had been escorting Rose, Joseph, and the others about a month back. Part of the way; Ryoka had arranged more escorts on their way south. Levil gave Ryoka a crooked grin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It wasn't the worst. But between you and me, Ryoka? Only for you would we escort that lot. Just insane. You know one of them was drunk the entire way?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joseph. &lt;/em&gt;Ryoka closed her eyes. Oh, she knew what a handful that lot was. She opened her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I appreciate it. And believe me—I know. We had them for four days. I had to get them moving or Fierre would have killed them. Alber refused to come to the inn after the second day."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She felt guilty over sending them to Liscor. But hopefully—no. Where else did they have to go? Ryoka's stomach twisted. She reached for her bag of holding unconsciously. Then stopped herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, really. I'll repay the favor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You pulled us out of that situation with the frogs once. As far as I'm concerned, we're still not square."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Levil raised his mug. Ryoka turned red from the embarrassment. She exchanged a few more words, promised to drink with them later. Rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Runner's Guild next. Ryoka didn't know if she liked knowing the [Receptionist], Alime, by name, or the Runners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ryoka! We just got a big request to run a delivery. Nothing dangerous, but let me have it? &lt;em&gt;Please?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Melodie caught Ryoka at the door. The City Runner raised her hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All yours. I'm not running far."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Thank you!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman hugged Ryoka. For a moment, Ryoka smiled and remembered a pinched girl's face, arguments with Fals. Then it was gone and Melodie was trotting towards the desk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alime, I'm looking for that delivery to Lupp. And I promised to head south, so if I swing down that way, what can you give me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Receptionist] smiled at Ryoka. And the City Runner belatedly coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh, sorry. Hi. How's it going?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, thank you, Ryoka. And I have Mister Lupp's delivery…I can give you three, if that's alright? Nothing but copper and a bit of silver."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Works for me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka took the deliveries. She put them in her crowded bag of holding. Then jogged out of the Runner's Guild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Out of the city. The day's light was fading. The [Guards] called to Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Wind Runner! A breeze?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman raised a hand and they shouted their thanks. Ryoka felt the wind blowing at her back. She had more control over it since visiting Riverfarm. Just a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she couldn't conjure the tornado made out of wind and fire she had when she had been at the heart of witchcraft. Nor did she run nearly as fast. She ran, drinking from a stamina potion when her pace faltered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;About two hours later, Ryoka finished her last delivery as she ran towards a small farm with towering corn stalks. A scarecrow was sitting outside the field. Ryoka hopped over the locked gate. And she ran towards the scarecrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lupp! Lupp, is that you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She approached the person-sized scarecrow warily. Ryoka walked around the scarecrow and saw—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A painted face. She heard laughter. And the farmhouse's doors opened to reveal Farmer Lupp. The old [Farmer] walked down the steps, waving at Ryoka. She grinned at him and trotted over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Miss Ryoka. You're back again. So soon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have your money from Lady Bethal and something from your daughter. Also—the stuff you ordered."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka began pulling objects out of her bag of holding. Money—and a receipt from the Runner's Guild for the full amount. A little jar from Lupp's daughter. And a few bottles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alcohol. Lupp sighed as he eyed the gin. He'd asked Ryoka to bring him some. The [Farmer] took it all eagerly, then did a double-take at the &lt;em&gt;gold&lt;/em&gt; mixed with the silver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods, but that [Lady] kept her word. Gold for corn. Who'd have thought it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You say that every time. When are you going to stop?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka teased Lupp gently. The [Farmer] just stared at the small fortune he'd been given. Then he closed the money pouch and looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But his farm was isolated. And his beautiful fields of corn were growing again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've made three harvests. Figured that Lady Walchaís would get bored of the corn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's not eating it all. It's going to a market."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Still. It's worth all this? And she sends a wagon by each month, a proper fast one. As if my corn's…well, it is some of the best you'd ever eat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] caught himself, straightening with pride. Ryoka grinned. She liked Lupp. The lonely farmer…she understood. Perhaps more than even Fierre, or Alber. They had parts of Ryoka's passions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Lupp stood there, looking grateful just to talk to someone. He nodded awkwardly towards the bottles of gin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine stuff you brought. As good as the gold. Did my daughter say aught?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just that you should stop sending her gold."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hah. What else do I use it for? She can…thank you for running it to her. Here. A tip."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp fumbled for a gold coin. Ryoka put her hand out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's fine—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. No. Take it. It's too much otherwise. You do these regular deliveries when I know you have better paying work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Reluctantly, the young Asian woman took the money. Then she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks. People have been too kind to me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh? And you're the first person I've seen the last three days. What did you do today? Er—come in. Can I offer you some of the gin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wouldn't want to prevail—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] glanced up under his hat. He eyed Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all. I'd take it kindly. But if you're busy, don't mind me, please."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had no artifice. Ryoka hesitated in the face of the naked choice. She ducked her head after a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…I'll stay. Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alike indeed. That was how, as dusk fell, Ryoka Griffin found herself in Lupp's farmhouse, sharing a meal. It was—corn. But delicious. You could eat it raw, boiled—and Lupp's corn was the best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Especially with some gin. The two drank as they ate. Ryoka related her day, Lupp speculated about a mega crow he'd seen leading the pack. That reminded Ryoka of Mavika.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Watch out for crows. I met a [Witch] once—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That crow bitch?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp was already on his second shot. He slammed down a fist and Ryoka jumped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; her?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. Anyone living far from cities knows…and my corn is the best! She tried to make me an offer. No crows for a year for two harvests. I turned her down so her crows took a crap all over my house. Damn [Witches]. How d'you know her? Don't tell me you got on her bad side. She's a nasty one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I actually met her in Riverfarm. It was this entire scene. I—it's hard to explain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tell me. Unless you have to be anywhere tonight?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka glanced out the window. Then she looked back at Lupp. The lonely [Farmer] was the best kind of audience. Hungry to know. She took a breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…No. Okay. Listen. Do you know about…other [Witches]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She told Lupp an abridged tale of the [Witches] at Riverfarm. The death of Ser Reim—the evil of Belavierr. A mother's twisted love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp listened, exclaiming, asking questions. Falling silent and shuddering at the image of wildfire set by a Drake. Belavierr's immortal, immoral bargains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All that happened while you were gone? You never said."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a Runner's life. I told Fierre—my friend. But how do you bring that up?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka shrugged awkwardly. Lupp laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not so easy. Now, me, I'll listen and say anything. Corn don't judge or talk back. When it does—I'll finally have gone crazy as a crow. And since then?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—I haven't seen Charlay. But I've sent her two [Messages] and we're going to meet soon. Runners always do. I'm mostly based around Reizmelt. Did I tell you about that group of—young people I met?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"About a month back? You looked as if you'd been gnawed on by rats. How's they doing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good. I hope. They're around Invrisil, but they stopped sending me [Messages]. I want to check on them…but…nah, I'll wait. They're probably just seeing the sights."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young Asian woman sighed. They were a constant worry, but she couldn't hold their hands forever. Nor was she willing to travel with them at a snail's pace; she could have funded them to go by overnight carriage, the fastest travel. But they didn't deserve that much gold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's all good, Lupp. Played with those kids. You should see them racing about with those sails. Teaching my friend, Alber, boxing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No bad days?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner paused. She smiled at Lupp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not recently. How about you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] smiled as well. He looked thoughtfully at his worn dining room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They come and go. Dark days. The gold doesn't help that. It glitters, but that's a poor light when the shadows come crawling. Like you said."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka had nothing to say to that. Lupp was the realest person she knew. Like an inverse Erin. A tired old man at times, who knew those dark days for what they were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So. Perhaps it was why she had come here. Because Farmer Lupp looked at Ryoka Griffin, smiling as she sat with him, being friendly. And he put words through her chest like an arrow through the crows he shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pardon me, Ryoka. But if I'm being honest, it seems like you're lying to me about those bad days."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman stirred. She looked up at Lupp and smiled. It wasn't hard. She'd learned to smile, to be sociable to people. To be…a person rather than the detached, moody City Runner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I really haven't had a bad day."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] mulled this over, unconvinced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe not a bad one, then. But you look miserable."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka blinked a few times. She'd been smiling all day. But she looked at Lupp and realized. Perhaps—that wasn't a smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp wasn't smiling. He'd smiled a few times, from seeing Ryoka, while she ate his corn—sparingly. Even though he was enjoying her company. That was a &lt;em&gt;smile, &lt;/em&gt;when it came out unasked for, completely genuine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hers was artificial. A social thing. Ryoka saw Lupp sit back, fumble for his cup. He poured some gin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Begging your pardon, Ryoka. I could be wrong. But I knew a fellow [Farmer] who I used to chat to—way back, oh, twenty years. Used to be closer. Just down the road."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I never saw…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"His farm's all overgrown. Nothing left. Rhir's hell, I dug up some of his stones for my fence. Old history. Point was—there was a time I would talk to him. After one of them bad winters. He smiled like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp took a gulp. Ryoka sat there, listening to his story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd ask about the crops, and so forth. And how he was doing what with it being dreadfully hard and all. Tightening our belts. And he'd smile and say it was all going to be okay."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her face was shadowed. Lupp looked at Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That was all. You don't meddle in a man's business more than that. Can't. So we'd just talk now and then. Until the day I came to his farm and it was empty. I checked all around. And—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"He hanged himself?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner sat there, shivering. Lupp looked at her with old eyes. Then he laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt; I thought so too. It would've been me there, after my wife. I checked the barn three times. But no. He left."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka started. She looked up at Lupp. Then she laughed, hoarsely, and grabbed the drink. They'd had the same conclusion. But—then she stopped, the bitter liquid at her lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They'd had the same conclusion. She lowered the cup, looked at Lupp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This farmer. Why did he leave?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp tossed his shot down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because he was a miserable bastard. Was for over ten whole years. I never asked. But I think he hated every second of being a [Farmer] that last few years. But he stayed—it was a family business. His father was a good [Farmer]. The man buried him and tried to be a great [Farmer]. But he wanted to do something else."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Needed to. Something ate away at him until he was hollow inside. Just like you, Miss Griffin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner looked at Lupp. She grinned, honestly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. You saw right through me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strange. I don't know my own daughter. But I look at you and sometimes it's like staring into a mirror. It's not good for such a young woman."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp raised his glass, eyed it, and put it down. Ryoka rested her arms on her knees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There is something. I have…something to do. Those young people I mentioned? I helped them—because I wanted something from them. Something valuable."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] didn't ask questions. He saw Ryoka shift, nearly touch the bag of holding. In it were a laptop, devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Treasure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Ryoka Griffin just looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Something very valuable. There's something I've been meaning to do, Lupp. But it'll take a while. I could—die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If it's not a secret, what is it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman sat in silence. She looked up, slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That [Witch]. Belavierr. When it was all over, she met me one last time, Lupp. And she made me an offer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer]—stopped. He looked at the young woman, swimming in the shadows by candlelight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They say a [Witch]'s bargains are something you should never take lightly. And seldom agree to. Dire methods for dire need."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, yes. They're right about that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka exhaled. She looked up at Lupp. And her eyes were also glistening a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The thing is—they always offer what you want the &lt;em&gt;most. &lt;/em&gt;I didn't tell you this, Lupp. But I've gotten my friends killed. People &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; me here. Fierre, Alber—everyone in Reizmelt. But I left all my mistakes behind. In the south. People died because of me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sometimes that happens. Sometimes a fellow has to run far away. No shame in that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] watched the candles flicker lower. He sat across from the City Runner. Ryoka took another gulp of liquid that burned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. But you can't run forever. I should know. You get really tired. Lupp. My best friend's name was Ivolethe. She wasn't like you or me. She died saving me. But you know what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's &lt;em&gt;alive.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka's eyes burned. She looked up at the [Farmer] and clenched her hand so tightly the glass &lt;em&gt;cracked.&lt;/em&gt; Ryoka let go, looked at Lupp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alive. But I'll never see her. That was her—punishment. It's not distance. It's…a curse. Magic. The kind only a [Witch] could undo."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] looked steadily at Ryoka. She didn't know if any of this was even coherent. But maybe it was to him, who lived in a world of magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The [Witch] offered me a way to see her. And I want to. I have to. She was—my first real friend. She still is. I don't have a purpose in the north beyond being…nice Ryoka. I left a child behind. Mrsha. I left a friend behind. Because I'm afraid of killing them. But I could bring one of them back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But I'm afraid of the consequences. What will happen this time? How badly will I…hurt everyone?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman looked at the old farmer. Lost. And he had no answer. The fates of corn wasn't like the lives yanked around by cruel destiny. The [Farmer] weighed his words carefully. Without much knowledge. But he spoke honestly, with all the clarity he could. Which is all you could do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not an adventurer, Miss Ryoka. Or a [Mage]. But it seems to me you're as miserable as that [Farmer] I knew. You speak of this like you have a choice…seems to me the only choice is when you go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka Griffin looked up. Lupp filled his glass with water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Or do you think you won't ever go chasing your friend and trying to free her from the curse?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The question struck Ryoka. And like that—it was like turning a key in her head. She bowed her head, feeling the world spinning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. That's absolutely right. I just fear what will happen. If it just happened to me, it would be alright."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lupp got up, taking their plates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True enough. That's the blessing in being alone. But between you and me, Miss Ryoka? I was close to a darker day when you met me than any before. Some nights swallow you. You've been a comfort to this old man, at least."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked back and saw her smile. Slowly, Ryoka Griffin stretched. She looked at Lupp, thoughtfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was old. Old—at least in some senses. Twenty one years old. Closer to twenty-two, now. But in some ways, Ryoka wasn't an adult yet. Not like Lupp was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was all relative. Children loved Ryoka. She was good at handling them, even if she didn't like it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a funny thing. Tears were difficult for Tyrion Veltras. He didn't know how to be gentle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice was a different problem. She was just no mother, could be thoughtless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Ryoka? She just hated seeing kids cry. She worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Perhaps all three missed the obvious. Which was that it was okay if children cried. Everyone needed to cry. To be uncertain. When did you stop parenting? And how did you do it well? Ryoka Griffin knew a lot of bad parenting techniques.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, Farmer Lupp cleaned a glass with some fresh water from a bucket. And he saw the young woman brushing at her eyes. Then she looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka Griffin exhaled. And she felt better. She stretched lightly, resolved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks, Lupp. I guess that clears it up. Just—can I ask one thing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What happened to the [Farmer] you knew? The miserable one? What did he do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old man turned. He smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why—he became an adventurer, of course. A famous one. He fought in the Second Antinium Wars against the Goblins. Ended up as part of a Named-Rank team."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka blinked at him. The [Farmer] looked back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're joking. Where's the ending? Is he dead?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. Name's Eldert. Think he changed it to something fancier, though. I haven't seen him since. But that was him. Used to grow beets."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner looked Lupp's face up and down. Searching for any hint he was actually pulling her leg. Then she sat back and laughed. Just laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She didn't know what exactly was funny about it. Lupp smiled. Then, Ryoka stood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've got to go, Lupp. Fierre's going to be &lt;em&gt;pissed&lt;/em&gt;. But I've got to go. Again. I hope I'll see you again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So you're going."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't a question. Ryoka smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My friend's alive. I just need to meet her again. One more time, Lupp. For that, it's easy to risk my life. Just not anyone else's."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes shone. Lupp nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll do my best. Thank you, Lupp. Really."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka Griffin walked towards the door and realized she hadn't ever wiped her feet. She did so now, on the carpet, embarrassed. Lupp laughed. He saw Ryoka open the door, as the darkness fled before the faint light in his farmhouse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had to ask. Before she left, the [Farmer] called out. Worried for the little girl running into the night. Brave—but a child still, to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Ryoka. That dark [Witch]. Did you take her offer to save your friend?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman turned. Her face was shrouded as she waited a second before replying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought about it. If it was the only way to save my friend—she gave me a time limit. Before the summer reaches its zenith."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not long now. Will you accept it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka Griffin paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, if it was my only way—I might have. But I thought about it then. And a [Witch]'s power…might be enough. But I have something better than a [Witch]. If I can get him on my side. So, no. I told Belavierr to eat shit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She heard the farmer laugh. Ryoka closed the door and ran, laughing as well. Smiling properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That night, Ryoka ran back to Reizmelt. She talked to Fierre, who was upset, and did something uncharacteristic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Driver] of the overnight carriage that ran the trade routes was obviously suspicious of Ryoka. After all—she was a City Runner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But I need to get south &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. This carriage runs all night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And all day. We don't stop except in cities to change horses. 'Sright. But we don't take Runners or their packages. Too dangerous. This is for pedestrians, Miss. You're not carrying anything?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not a thing. I can swear it on a truth stone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As it so happens…I have one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka patiently repeated herself. But the [Driver] was anxious. At last, relief came from Alime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Receptionist] came out of the Runner's Guild. Ryoka saw Fierre wink at her and nodded back gratefully. Alime spoke to the [Driver].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sir, I am the [Receptionist] of Reizmelt's Runner's Guild. We have no deliveries with Miss Griffin at this time and her reputation is impeccable."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka blushed. But the [Driver] was relieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I suppose that's all right then. Just—we've had three carriages attacked in the last few months. All due to us taking on Runners."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Is that Runner, uh, Alevica the [Witch] by any chance?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka winced. The [Driver] scowled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's exactly her. You a friend of hers?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely not. I hate her guts."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—well come on in then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The doors opened. Ryoka clambered in. She settled back, yawning. There were two people in the carriage who budged over for Ryoka. The [Driver] cracked a whip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Going south! Anyone coming with? &lt;em&gt;Off we go!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Ryoka rode south. Leaving Fierre, her friends behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Again. But she was headed south to confront the past. To find the one person better than a [Witch] at circumventing fae magic. To make an offer before the Summer Solstice. To meet, well…an old acquaintance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(12, 14, 14, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Dragon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;—-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That was all one week ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Now. Ryoka Griffin sat in a downpour. Well, not &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;, but the carriage was cramped. There were nine people in it heading south towards the High Passes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd been riding for an &lt;em&gt;entire week, &lt;/em&gt;only pausing to take short breaks. Ryoka was scribbling in her corner of the wagon as the [Driver] cursed and made the horses run down the muddy road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Coming up on Celum! We're going to have to stop when we reach the city—should be only twenty minutes at our speed! But this downpour's getting worse! And we can't move in it! Sorry folks, but we're having a rare delay!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The carriage was still moving fast. But if the rain continued it would be a danger. The passengers grumbled or sounded relieved. Ryoka was of mixed feelings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celum.&lt;/em&gt; She would run into Erin. The door. Her friends. She couldn't—maybe after—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner's gut churned. Maybe she'd just ask to get out now. It wasn't far to the High Passes if she just legged it. But a warm bed after a week of travel was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; appealing. But if it was that or chancing a meeting with an old face…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not yet. Let her meet Ivolethe first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her friend.&lt;/em&gt; Everything would be okay after that. Just let her fix this one thing. Ryoka closed her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Driver! I'm getting out here!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Driver], whose name was not Termin but Olat, was astonished. But Ryoka squeezed past the other passengers, then jumped out of the carriage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm close to my destination! I'll make it from here!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'll be drowned! Damn it, if you have to go, &lt;em&gt;go!&lt;/em&gt; But stay clear of rivers!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Driver] warned Ryoka, shouting above the downpour. She smiled, shouting back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you! Good luck!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He cracked the whip, raising one hand. Ryoka saw the carriage move past and looked around to get her bearings. The High Passes were—there. She could vaguely see them in the distance, those looming peaks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One week of travel. Ryoka felt at her bag of holding. She saw the carriage move past her. It was so dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Light]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka raised one hand. She saw a ball of light appear, warm and golden. Then—another, orange ball of light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner blinked. She hadn't conjured that. It was a distant thing. A will o' the wisp? No—it was growing larger. It was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka dove. The [Fireball] hit the carriage and detonated. The impact threw her into the mud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ears ringing. Shock—Ryoka stumbled to her feet. She looked around. What? Someone had just attacked—her? Persua?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. &lt;/em&gt;They galloped towards her out of the rain, laughing. A figure swooped out of the skies, riding a flying carpet. Another blurred towards her on foot, as fast as a Courier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Bandits]. No—again—Ryoka saw them pointing at her. A glowing crossbow rose. A shrouded figure produced two enchanted blades. She raised her hands, ears ringing. She didn't hear what they said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she knew them. All of the figures were masked. Covered from head to toe, to avoid revealing any features. They circled her and the burning carriage that had been full of living people, laughing. Ryoka saw the bloody mark on their masks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bloodfeast Raiders.&lt;/em&gt; They pointed at her as the City Runner raised her hands. Nowhere to run. As if she could evade them. The most feared, most elusive gang of marauders in all of Izril. The City Runner closed her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course. She should have known. Somewhere—Belavierr was probably laughing. Of course. She should have known. It was her. Not Erin. This was her fault.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was never, ever &lt;em&gt;easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">503570</guid><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 02:02:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - 7.23 LM</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/501822</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A new day dawned. And with it, a [Princess] rose from her bed. An [Innkeeper] rolled out of her bed and onto the floor. A Hobgoblin [Bard] yawned, checked the sun, and put the pillow over his head. A white Gnoll sat on the ledge of the windowsill, watching the sun coming up. An Antinium [Hunter] was sitting in his tower, eating a raw egg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha raised her paws as if she were holding the sun up. Bird looked around for birdsong and checked his bow. Erin Solstice said 'ow'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Lyonette du Marquin found the bed was as comfortable as she remembered. Although the pillows had changed. And she was no longer lying against Pawn as he sat-slept against the wall. Since he was, in fact, a poor pillow with his non-flesh body, Lyonette had been sleeping against some pillows bunched around him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Fortress of Fluff. The [Princess] looked around and saw the [Priest] was staring through a window. At the sky. Like Mrsha, giggling and watching as she 'held' the fire in the sky, the Antinium still wondered at the sight. The [Princess] smiled and stretched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Morning, Pawn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium looked at her. And smiled with all the pleasure in his being. He had no subterfuge, no reserve. When the Antinium did something, they held nothing back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette rose. And it was a different room—Pawn's—that she woke up in. The mattress she'd added, but the Antinium had a little cave-fort of blankets and pillows he normally slept in. His censer was lying on a desk, ready to be cleaned. He had two books he'd bought with money from his salary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In Erin's room, the young woman looked up at the little Gnoll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Hey, Mrsha. I forgot you're sleeping here. Did I wake you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll shook her head. The [Druid] smiled in the sunlight, as Apista buzzed through the open window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue rolled over in his bed. He had a hangover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A new day. And everything was different. Again. Erin Solstice, bleary in her pajamas—very comfy one-piece nightwear much like ones from her world, but a bit oversized since it had been made for Gnolls—saw Mrsha climb out the window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha! Hold on! You can't do that!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll scampered up the roof. Erin tumbled out after her. She hurried out onto the roof, calling out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha! I told you—no roof climbing! Or surfing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll scampered up the roof as Apista buzzed higher. Bird, looking in the distance at a flight of Razorbeaks flying high overhead, saw a white form scuttling up the roof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that a rat? No, that is not a rat. That is Mrsha. Hello, good morning!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Hunter] sang to the Gnoll. Erin, cursing, saw Mrsha running nimbly past arched windows, each of which led to its own room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wandering Inn's second floor was done. And many rooms were now open. And the third floor, where Bird's tower was set until the renovations were done? It too would hold guests, in lovely rooms. Lyonette wanted the third floor to be more luxurious, which meant larger rooms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For now, the second floor could hold far more guests than it ever had. And the inn was still under construction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Marching Workers leaving the city covered in detritus looked up and saw the young woman scrambling up the roof. And the Gnoll child, waving happily at Bird as he waved back. They headed up the hill, ready to help build this sacred place. It made the shouting, the trash throwing—everything worth it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A sanctuary to them. Something as close to a place of worship as the barracks in their Hive. And they were not the only ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice ran after Mrsha as the Gnoll raced down the rooftop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha! Get back here!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her voice roused Numbtongue. He raised his head and saw a pajama-wearing Erin run past his window. The Hobgoblin [Bard] paused. He looked for the bottle of gin he'd taken and shook it suspiciously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No, that was real.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Reiss' ghost commented from his seat. Numbtongue put the pillow over his head as Erin kept yelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'll fall! You'll slip! You'll—&lt;em&gt;oh heck—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wind-milled her arms as &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; nearly slipped off the side of the inn. The incline wasn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; steep, but Erin's bipedal format was actually much more precarious than the four-legged scamper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha ignored Erin. She raced past Pawn's window, then stopped and &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; through. The [Princess] yelped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mrsha! &lt;/em&gt;Close the windows, Pawn! Erin will see us!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are we ashamed? Erin said that shame was a sign of sin in her story about the Garden of Eden. Not the [Garden of Sanctuary], but it seems to me that Erin will find out eventually—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Not when I'm half-naked right now! Shut the windows!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pawn obediently closed the windows. Mrsha stuck her tongue out at the [Priest]. Pawn turned to Lyonette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I do not think Mrsha likes me anymore. This is distressing. I would like to rectify her grievances."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette opened her mouth, and then saw Mrsha race off past the curtains. Erin followed, oblivious, still yelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mrsha! Get back here! I'm gonna get mad! I mean, I'm already ticked off!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It didn't seem to occur to her that &lt;em&gt;chasing&lt;/em&gt; Mrsha was enabling the little Gnoll's fun. Lyonette sighed. The real move was to calmly tell Mrsha to come back inside and offer her escalating punishments. Erin could have used her [Inn's Aura], offered Mrsha a bribe, or done any number of things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Erin wouldn't be &lt;em&gt;Erin&lt;/em&gt; if logic was her first reaction after waking up. The [Innkeeper] thundered after the gleeful Mrsha. Actually, Erin was starting to see why Mrsha liked running on the roof. Aside from the drop off the edge where she could see herself breaking an arm—or her neck—this was fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She raced past a window and then blinked. A Lamia, completely naked, stood in front of his window, staring out at the glorious morning. And Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She froze, mid-step. Hexel Quithail, the [Architect] for Liscor who had arrived yesterday, stared at Erin. She stared back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A fun fact was that Lamias had genitalia. Not like regular Lizardfolk, but there you were. Theirs were actually retractable. Like snakes. Hexel recoiled slightly. Then he waved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin waved back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um. Sorry. Just chasing Mrsha…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel spoke through the glass. He slowly slithered forwards, drew the curtains. Erin backed away. Then she heard a scream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A pair of Lizardfolk poked their heads out &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; window. They stared at Erin, and then at Mrsha. She was pressed up against another window. And inside, Imani, one of the young people from Earth, was in hysterics. A Gnoll &lt;em&gt;staring&lt;/em&gt; at you through a window as you blearily looked up was actually scary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice saw more windows pop open. Joseph nearly fell out. Rose looked around and stared at Erin. Hexel Quithail heard the young woman shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hold on! That's just Mrsha! Mrsha, &lt;em&gt;stop that!&lt;/em&gt; Get down right now! I'm actually mad! Sorry, nothing to see here—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What a fascinating &lt;em&gt;inn.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lamia smiled to himself. Lyonette covered her face as she hurried out the door. Pawn called after her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I must go to work, Lyonette! But I will see you tonight! How am I romancing—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Shh!&lt;/em&gt; We'll read a book! Have a good day! Love you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She clattered down the steps to the inn as Erin grabbed Mrsha. Then slipped and went tumbling down the side of the roof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette found Erin hanging from the edge of the roof as Mrsha tried to haul her up, shouting curses. And that was how another day in The Wandering Inn started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Madness, chaos, laughter, and &lt;em&gt;change. &lt;/em&gt;Breakfast was sausage, eggs, and toast. Grilled tomatoes, unless you hated tomatoes. Mrsha had to eat hers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;—-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The city of Liscor and The Wandering Inn had changed again, overnight. The old dynamic, the old cast and the stakes were rearranged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Change, that elusive beast, had struck again. And it had come time and time again to Liscor. So much so that &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;, was, in itself, a kind of normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Invrisil had come to Liscor via the magic door. A group of Earthers had reached The Wandering Inn. The [Architect] was here—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Magnolia Reinhart had splendidly thrown the Antinium under a metaphorical carriage and run them over. Everything was different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;How you dealt with such shifts in 'normality' really depended on who you were. Some people resisted it, demanding everything go back to yesterday. Others embraced it, or at least, the change that benefitted them. But only a few really understood how fluid this world was. Tomorrow, the world could be upside down. Metaphorically speaking. Or sometimes…literally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the people who knew this, but didn't &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it was Olesm Swifttail. He woke up in his lovely little apartment, which he'd rented on his [Tactician] salary when he was first hired, in an apartment just off market-street. Not exactly high-end, but nice. He stared out into the street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And no [Innkeeper] ran past his window, chasing a white Gnoll. No glorious sun awaited him. But the world was different than he had left it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was chanting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No more Antinium! Get out of our city! No more lies! No more Antinium!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A crowd was marching in the streets. Olesm listened. They had learned this, from the election. As people did, what was new yesterday—elections, social movements—were now old-hat. And those lessons paid dividends now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;We've been lied to enough! Get rid of the Antinium! No more Ants!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Gnoll was bellowing through a primitive megaphone—her paws. And the crowd of Drakes and Gnolls were marching, waking up the neighborhood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No more Ants! Get out of our city!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No more Humans! Give back our jobs! Liscor is not for you!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The second chant might not have been intentional, but it was shouted with the same fervor as the first. And some in the crowd might not have agreed. But the city was moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm rested his forehead on the windowsill as he stood, in his undergarments. Facing another morning. How had it come to this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart had destroyed the old order. She'd exposed the Antinium's illegalities en-masse. And—it terrified Olesm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They could sack this city.&lt;/em&gt; Soldiers and Workers combined were nearly ten times that of the current Watch. Yes, Workers weren't [Fighters], but they could kill your average citizen. Olesm hadn't seen it. He stood, feeling lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Going to be more work. Walled Cities summoning the Council. The army too. And Watch Captain Zevara…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But not him. He was a failure of a [Strategist]. He didn't deserve his class. A Human &lt;em&gt;[Lady]&lt;/em&gt; had done what should have been his job. Olesm—was just a fool. A fool without the magical inn. A fool wasn't welcome there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, Olesm Swifttail dressed. His magic was gone. He was just a Drake, who'd participated in an adventurer's raid on a dungeon, once. Nearly died. He'd made a few decisions, run a chess magazine that had achieved worldwide acclaim—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But all of it had been because of &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. Erin Solstice. Not him. He was just a fraud who rode her coattails. The Drake knew it. He wasn't like Erin. He had none of her magic. Without her?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He checked his cupboards, realized he hadn't bought any breakfast, and walked out his door. Head hung low. The marching in the streets continued. Antinium, the few of them, hurried about their business. The people hurled detritus at the Workers, jeering. The mood had turned against the Antinium in a day, thanks to the Deadly Flower of the North, Magnolia Reinhart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the Antinium could kill them all. And Olesm…what was his role? The Drake miserably went looking for breakfast. And wished he could ask Erin for help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she. Hated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As the sun rose higher and The Wandering Inn opened for breakfast, a Level 19 [Princess] &lt;em&gt;clashed&lt;/em&gt; with a Level 41 [Innkeeper].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get. Out. Of. My. Inn.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice pointed. Her eyes blazed. The room &lt;em&gt;vibrated&lt;/em&gt;. It was a current in the air, which made Mrsha, eating breakfast with a headachy Numbtongue, look up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] refused to budge. The air around her—shimmered. With concentrated intensity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper]'s eyes narrowed. There was a &lt;em&gt;huge &lt;/em&gt;disparity in their levels, but somehow the [Princess] was holding her ground. But the room began to actually &lt;em&gt;shake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I said, get—&lt;em&gt;out.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her willpower and the power in the air became overwhelming. Lyonette staggered. Her feet began to move towards the door. Numbtongue and Mrsha watched, forks poised, as the [Princess]' feet began to drag her towards the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then—Lyonette halted. She fought back, gritting her teeth hard. Her eyes flashed with royal pride. The kind of resolve that had forged nations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Never.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin's eyes narrowed. And the pressure became physically &lt;em&gt;crushing&lt;/em&gt;. Now, Lyonette was assailed not just with the desire to &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt;, but with overpowering &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt;. It hurt! But she drew her aura around herself, concentrating it, forming a layer around her body, forcing Erin back—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Another sausage, Mister Ratici? You're here early. Don't mind them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi passed by Lyonette holding some of the hot breakfast sausages. A Drake tipped his cap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're a blessing, miss. What're we watching?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, just a thing. Don't worry, it happens all the time. This is normal. Mister Wilovan, can I refill your cup?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bartender] and [Gossip] saw the Gnoll touch the brim of his tall hat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm well served, Miss Drassi. Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Polite as could be, the two watched Erin and Lyonette facing off. Some of the inn's extra-early guests were filing in. And the [Princess]—despite Erin's power in &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; place—refused to budge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get lost or I'll smack you! I'm gonna! Inn—smack her!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin pointed at Lyonette, her brows drawn together. But the inn failed to manifest a helpful army to hit Lyonette. And as the stalemate drew on—Erin—began—to lose focus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The pressure lightened. Erin wiped at her brow. Lyonette felt the pressure on her relax and exhaled. Erin Solstice teetered to a chair and sat down. Mrsha patted Erin's head with a napkin. Numbtongue pushed over a pitcher of water as Lyonette came over and sat down too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whew! What? How'd you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Panting, Erin looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] shook her head. She took the glass of water, gulped from it, wiped her mouth, and then took another sip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were training their auras. Or at least, Erin had asked Lyonette to practice after being beaten by Magnolia. The problem was…she was going about it all wrong. Lyonette panted at the [Innkeeper] as more people began coming downstairs, like a dressed Hexel—which meant clothes over his upper half and midriff—nothing around his gleaming tail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I told you, Erin. That's not how Auras &lt;em&gt;work.&lt;/em&gt; You're using yours like a hammer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. And I nearly smacked you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin exhaled a few times before putting a fried egg on toast and biting into it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you didn't. And you never &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have gotten me to budge. Let alone Magnolia. Didn't you feel what I was doing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman frowned. She looked at Lyonette and recalled the feeling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. You bunched up. Like…a rock. I couldn't shift you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I consolidated my aura. You were using yours like a hammer. It was too wide, Erin. And few auras can &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; someone just—move. You could keep me out a lot easier than force me to leave. One's a shield, the other is—hard."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette looked at Erin. The [Innkeeper] was frowning, trying to understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…I don't quite get it. Explain it again?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] exhaled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I told you, I never took many aura-lessons. My mother didn't think it was time yet—I was a &lt;em&gt;Level 5—&lt;/em&gt;you-know-what. But this is what she taught me. Erin, you're unskilled. &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; better at using my aura. You have high potency—no manifestation or control."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [innkeeper] blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have what the what the what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] rubbed at her head. She had a headache, despite being able to resist someone twenty levels higher than she was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Potency. The power of your aura &lt;em&gt;in your inn&lt;/em&gt; is strong. As strong as Magnolia's maybe. But your control—how you use it—is weak. Magnolia could refine her aura until she could actually &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; you out of the way, or hold everyone down. Erin—is like a giant blanket. She affects everything. She doesn't focus on one person."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded to the room as a whole. Mrsha and Numbtongue nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Too wide."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bard] summarized for Lyonette. Erin's eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. 'Too wide'. But you could fix that, Erin. You just need to practice. Focus on me; you were doing it near the end."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But why didn't I move you if I had more power? I shoulda thrown you out, like &lt;em&gt;bam!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin punched her palm. Mrsha copied her, nodding. Lyonette looked at both of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not how auras work, Erin. It's not—arm wrestling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! Why would it be? Erin, auras mix and match. Some win over others. It's…complex. And I'm not an expert. What I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know is that you have potency, no control, and no manifestation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's the manifestation bit?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can't make a sword out of your aura and cut someone in half with it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue looked up from his food. So did Mrsha, her eyes shining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin blinked. Lyonette nodded casually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. But you need a specific aura. [Knights] have more…combat focused ones. Like a Thronebearer [Knight] from Calanfer. They can concentrate their auras, &lt;em&gt;coat&lt;/em&gt; their blades in magical light to attack Ghosts. But that's because their auras are tied to light and such. Yours? You have an [Inn's Aura]. Hard to manifest that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Well—can I try?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you want to—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin raised her hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Aura Sword]!&lt;/em&gt; Hiyah!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She brought it down. Lyonette recoiled. So did Numbtongue. Mrsha stared hopefully at the table. Erin stared at the uncut butter in front of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Don't do that!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette shouted at Erin. The young woman sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I need more practice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another morning in The Wandering Inn. Hexel was looking around the inn with his Lizardfolk assistants. They looked markedly less nervous in the inn, but they backed away as Drassi came over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whoops, excuse me. Architect Quithail! I'm &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; sorry for this morning's incident. Can we get you breakfast? Part of your room and board. We have eggs, toast, sausages, tomatoes—I don't know what Lizardfolk eat, I'm sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] excused herself and hurried over to tend to the Lamia herself. He smiled at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I found it quite entertaining. I am a Lamia, Miss…Lyon? Yes, Lyon. I enjoyed it. I might have a different opinion if it was at the dead of night, but hatchlings—excuse me—children, are a delight. I have to meet with Liscor's Council later, or someone about my designs, but please! Breakfast us away!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He indicated his Lizardfolk group. Lyonette smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right here, sir. Unless you'd like a private room? No? Well, we can add more meat or less meat depending on your dietary preferences…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I like eggs. But we are carnivorous, by and large. Might we have undercooked sausage?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Ours are actually pre-cooked. This entire inn has a [Field of Preservation] on it, Mister Hexel. But we could—Drassi, get one of the uncooked steaks, would you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lamia brightened. Ratici nudged Wilovan. The Gnoll calmly opened one eye and whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I heard. Pray, allow me to continue my morning's repast uninterrupted, Ratici."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He went back to eating his toast. Hexel meanwhile was chortling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh yes. Some of that steak, rare and bloody? And the eggs on toast. We'd be &lt;em&gt;delighted&lt;/em&gt;, Miss Lyon. An entire inn under…? Of course, that's an [Innkeeper]'s Skill. How useful!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He smiled as a steak was brought out. Lyonette began counting the cost and debating whether she should add it to his tab—but caught herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel Quithail and his company were &lt;em&gt;special guests. &lt;/em&gt;He paid well, and—despite it being a steak—it wasn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; expensive in the summer. This wasn't the bad old days where the inn had to count every copper coin. They had money. Lyonette told herself that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she had big plans. Oh, yes. Big plans for the inn. The [Princess] served the guests as Drassi passed her the food, and then returned to Erin's table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There she saw Mrsha was busy picking bits of cut sausage off a neighboring table's plates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns of Hammerad were awake. They sat at the tables, as if nothing had changed. Pisces was eating with good humor, shielding his plate. Yvlon wasn't eating sausage, so Mrsha had no beef with her—or pork—but Ceria was laughing and swatting at her playfully. Ksmvr had &lt;em&gt;hissed&lt;/em&gt; at Mrsha when she tried to steal from him, so the half-Elf was the logical target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop that, Mrsha! Mrsha!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha! Stop that at once!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll swiped another piece of sausage as Lyonette put her hands on her hips, embarrassed. Ceria looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's just playing, Lyon—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She has her breakfast. And that is terribly bad manners. Mrsha! Enough!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette raised a finger warningly. Mrsha looked up. And the young Gnoll hesitated. She eyed Lyonette and gave her a defiant look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha didn't like it when Lyonette…stayed the night in Pawn's room. Lyonette had explained, and Mrsha definitely understood—she had grown up in a Plains Gnoll tribe, where &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; could hear and smell when a couple got together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She just didn't like it. Mrsha even liked Pawn as…Pawn. She just didn't like the idea of Pawn being &lt;em&gt;Lyonette's&lt;/em&gt;, or vice-versa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So she tossed her head defiantly, rather like Lyonette herself and reached for a scrap on Ceria's plate. Lyonette put her hands on her hips. She lowered her voice so that only those next to her would hear and whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mrsha du Marquin, &lt;/em&gt;I'm warning you once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha froze. So did Erin, and Numbtongue, who were close enough to hear the whisper. Mrsha slowly lowered her paw and &lt;em&gt;harrumphed &lt;/em&gt;her way back over to her table. Lyonette sat down, only mildly exasperated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin looked at the [Princess]. She lowered her voice too. Only a Gnoll would have been able to hear, and only one close by. Even Wilovan's ears didn't twitch—but perhaps that was because listening in was ungentlemanly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…You call her Mrsha du Marquin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. Why not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette looked challengingly at Erin. The young woman closed her mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrsha du Marquin, &lt;/em&gt;Mrsha the Prim and Proper, glumly took her fork and poked at her toast and egg. But she was a good girl…for all of three minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then the Earthers came downstairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Whoa! &lt;/em&gt;It wasn't a dream!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin stared about the inn. Joseph blinked around at the bright, painful room and held his head. But he was there, and Rose, Galina, Troydel, Imani, and Leon. The seven young people who had been in Magnolia's care were…here. In the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin stopped smiling. Mrsha's head slowly rose. She backed out of her chair as Rose made a sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh! There she is! Hello! Mrsha! Cutie!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She and Galina stared at Mrsha, overly excited to see her. Imani just shivered and hid behind Kevin, who was tallest along with Joseph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seven people from Earth. Strangers. Even to Erin. The young woman slowly rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Hi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd nearly forgotten about last night. The revelation that Ryoka had sent these people here was…well, it had been too big for Erin to do anything but react to. She'd given them a room after asking questions—but they'd all been tired and most more than a little bit drunk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wild. That's a Gnoll, Rose. Not a dog. And those are Drakes and that's…uh…one of the Antinium. I think. Not Bird? Are you Bird?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin waved at Ksmvr. The [Skirmisher]'s head rose, confused. He looked at Ceria, who was getting her own looks from Troydel—known as 'Troy', and Leon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am not Bird."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right, cool."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin nodded a few times. He was distinctly…Kevin. Lyonette remembered him flirting unsuccessfully with Drassi last night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others were harder for her to pin any details on. Joseph was noticeably the most hung over of the group. He'd been drinking hard and subsequently run up a large amount of their—unpaid—tab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose was one of the group's leaders. She was also fascinated by Mrsha, who'd slunk off her seat in the face of the stares. Mrsha peeked around Numbtongue and glowered at the group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They stared at Numbtongue too. And only a few of them looked at all uneasy. The perpetually-afraid Imani shivered at Numbtongue's crimson eyes and green skin, but Leon only nudged Troydel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"An &lt;em&gt;Orc.&lt;/em&gt; I'm telling you…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Galina was excitedly staring about the inn, at the stage where the [Players] had performed last night. And Troydel and Leon were arguing over whether Numbtongue was an 'Orc', or another Goblin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But all seven looked around the inn as if they were, well, tourists, or visitors. Lyonette had the distinct impression that if one of them had owned a 'camera', that thing from Erin's world they used to take images, they would have been taking pictures now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um…yeah. Hi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin just looked at them. She had known them. Or so Lyonette gathered. The others looked at Erin, blinking at her apron. The young woman hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—we have a lot to talk about. Why don't you take a seat? And have breakfast? We've got sausages, eggs on toast, tomatoes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh yes! From home!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Instantly, the group lit up ecstatically. They sat next to Lyonette's table. And the convivial atmosphere of the morning changed for Lyonette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She and Drassi served the food. She heard them exclaiming in relief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Proper food. Not like what we've eaten sometimes. Thank you &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;—do you have waffles? Or pancakes? I've been dying to have some…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Galina was talking to Erin. The young woman blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I mean, we do, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can I get &lt;em&gt;bacon?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin practically shouted. Joseph swore and covered his ears. Leon's head rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait—do you have hamburgers? I saw that on the menu, but &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; ate mine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He glared at Joseph. Erin hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We…have them. But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can we get them? I mean, it's from &lt;em&gt;home."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others gave Erin a pleading look. Lyonette sighed as Erin turned to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Coming up. Who wants a hamburger?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No lettuce on mine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Troydel instantly raised his hand. Lyonette paused—and sighed. She went into the kitchen and came back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't &lt;em&gt;believe this.&lt;/em&gt; You have an inn! How did you get it? Did you find it? I mean—I remember us meeting way back when, but this is incredible! Do you own it? Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose was chatting to Erin. The young woman nodded, watching Kevin bite into his cheeseburger and &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;. Mrsha's head poked over the table, narrow-eyed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I did. I mean—the first inn wasn't mine. But I fixed it up and I run it. That's my class. [Innkeeper]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whoa. So you're &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; this world. Really? And you work here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin looked up. Erin looked at Numbtongue. The Goblin was eying the Earthers who didn't seem &lt;em&gt;bothered&lt;/em&gt; by him, just—fascinated. Galina and Rose were staring at him and whispering and so was Leon, muttering about a videogame to Troydel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…no tusks…but they have Minotaurs, man…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The lack of fear so much as naked curiosity bothered the Hobgoblin [Bard]. He slowly edged away from his table until he was sitting with the Horns of Hammerad. Ceria realized her eyes were also the focus of much staring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just insane. Wild. We were at Magnolia's mansion the entire time. Which &lt;em&gt;sucked&lt;/em&gt;. Right until the [Assassins] attacked—what's your level?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph had recovered with the food enough to join in asking questions. Even &lt;em&gt;Erin&lt;/em&gt; was wincing and looking around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lower your voice. We can talk about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? &lt;em&gt;Oh—&lt;/em&gt;right. Well, we came all the way here looking for you. Ryoka &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; you had an inn, but we didn't know you had a magic door! That's nuts."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin exhaled. Lyonette and Mrsha both looked up sharply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryoka. &lt;/em&gt;The [Innkeeper] spoke carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ryoka. Yeah, she sent all of you. She sent me a letter. But I didn't know you were…uh…coming. Where is she? Is she okay? Why did she send you all?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette nodded. She came over and the others looked at her. Rose hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ryoka? Well—she arrived just before the—&lt;em&gt;[Assassins].&lt;/em&gt; She took our electronics. All of them. And she told us to come here since Magnolia's estates were under attack."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two young women waited, but Rose was done. Erin looked at Lyonette helplessly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Nothing more?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—she said your inn wasn't always safe, but you'd take us in. She was really busy. She had this boxer-friend who hated our guts, but she hired some adventurers to escort us south. We weren't in Reizmelt long."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reizmelt. So Ryoka's there?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess]'s hands tightened on the tabletop. Mrsha looked at Rose. The young woman, oblivious to the hidden emotion, nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. They call her the Wind Runner of Reizmelt. She can command the wind. Didn't you know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around. The Horns of Hammerad were listening in. Erin's eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She &lt;em&gt;can? &lt;/em&gt;Wait—how is she? Tell us all about her!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So much emotion. So much history. Rose hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's…good. Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good &lt;em&gt;how?&lt;/em&gt; Is she missing any more fingers? Is she okay? How is she commanding the wind?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Earthers leaned back in the face of the intense questions. They looked at each other. But they didn't know. Ryoka was 'good'. They hadn't asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At this point, Lyonette had to serve some familiar guests. Griffon Hunt had come down the stairs, and Cade was sleepily clinging to his mother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halrac. &lt;/em&gt;It is so good to see you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What are we, spare thread?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi grumbled, but with a smile as Lyonette served them. And they could order whatever they wanted for breakfast, no questions asked. Because…they were friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cade got a special egg-and-bacon breakfast in the form of a smile that made him laugh. Briganda, a double serving. Halrac, less sausage and more toast with butter and a bit of honey. Revi, extra the honey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous wanted just the standard breakfast; he wasn't picky, but he got tea with his meal, hot from a pot. And Lyonette begrudged them none of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Why? Again, because they were friends. Revi eyed the seven Earthers still talking with Erin. And the unusually mystified look on Erin's face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who's that lot? I saw them last night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Friends of Ryoka. They're a bit of a handful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette had &lt;em&gt;no &lt;/em&gt;idea what they were going to do with them. What did Ryoka expect? Were they to feed and house them forever? It was just like Ryoka…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi's face more than expressed Lyonette's mood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ryoka's friends? A handful? You're kidding. No, I'm shocked. My condolences, Lyonette."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry about it. Are you all staying?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're going to Hedault's today. With the Horns of Hammerad. To get our treasure appraised. Hedault told us to wait until mid-morning, though. &lt;em&gt;[Enchanters].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I might stay behind. Cade needs his mother. If that's alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda looked up. Cade stared at Halrac. The [Scout] looked up, dour-faced. He tried to look…less-menacing. And failed. Lyonette just nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As long as you like. Of course, we can let you get back to Invrisil, Miss Briganda. Or you can explore Liscor—anything you want."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Shield Maiden] brightened up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Just like that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette nodded, although she herself had nearly forgotten—The City of Adventurers was open to the public, albeit at a fee. But anyone could visit anytime they wanted. This new dynamic really &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; take some getting used to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Speaking of which…Lyonette's head snapped up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Drassi! Did you check the door?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, Ancestors! I'm so sorry! I'll do it now! Excuse me, anyone from Liscor? I'm &lt;em&gt;so sorry,&lt;/em&gt; we've had uh, a few delays—come in!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi ran for the door. Lyonette heard her voice coming down the hallway. Lyonette finished talking and serving Griffon Hunt and left them smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The smile faded as she saw Mrsha's face. The Gnoll was standing at the table on two legs, peeking over the edge as Erin talked with them, asking about Ryoka and what was happening in the north and receiving vague, unhelpful answers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because the Earthers didn't know. And that was frustrating but—Erin knew how they'd lived, even if she disapproved. She knew Magnolia Reinhart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So did Lyonette. She even saw something familiar in the way the others looked so…lost. Even if that was aggravating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Mrsha? Mrsha was just Mrsha. Mrsha all the way. And she only knew Ryoka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her friend. The City Runner who had carried her out of oblivion. Who had been there when her tribe ended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka and Ivolethe, from another time. Ryoka, whom Mrsha had looked to as the only one who remembered, who had taken her to this inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Who had run away after Brunkr had died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Ryoka.&lt;/em&gt; And the little Gnoll probably still loved the sad, brilliant, wounded, guilty, triumphant Runner. Even if she was so angry at being left behind with no contact. Even if she understood her curse had driven Ryoka away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;These were the things Mrsha believed. If Ryoka had come in that door, Mrsha might have run to her and hugged her before anything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this? This was Ryoka's…gift. What she had decided she &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to send to The Wandering Inn. These seven…Humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha stared. And her little face slowly turned from incomprehension to—dislike. She looked at these people, eating &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; hamburger and being so stupid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she did not like them. Not. One. Bit. Imani was staring at Mrsha. The Gnoll glowered at her and Imani flinched. Then someone put her hand on Mrsha's head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So. Cute."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Galina tried to pet Mrsha. Instantly, the Gnoll &lt;em&gt;punched &lt;/em&gt;the hand off her head. Erin saw Galina recoil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ow!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't pet Mrsha, please. She's not a pet. She's a Gnoll."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But she's so—adorable! I didn't mean to bother you! Mrsha, right? You're so precious! Hello! Can you say 'hi'?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Galina bent over. And innocent as the question was—it was the wrong one to ask. She didn't know. Ryoka had never told her about Mrsha. The Gnoll's ears flattened and she backed away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha can't speak. She's a kid. Ryoka rescued her, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin's stomach felt upset. She didn't &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what Ryoka had intended. What was she supposed to do? Ryoka! She wanted to grab Ryoka, find her, and shake her. The others were just looking at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you're willing to—give us a place to stay, and food, we won't be a problem. We can help out. This is a great inn, Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin looked around. His vague assurances were added to by the others. Erin nodded, helplessly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. I mean—definitely. You can stay here. I guess we can have you help?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] frowned. Was that &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; job? But then Erin looked to the stairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;There they are.&lt;/em&gt; I told you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa and Beza were staring at the Earthers. Like hawks who'd sighted a bunch of baby rabbits who'd basted themselves in barbeque sauce. Erin sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stay here. Don't say &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about home. Got it? There are problems—&lt;em&gt;Montressa! I need to speak to you!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] ran for the stairs. Montressa jumped and backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin, listen—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Don't you dare send anything! And you! How many times have I told you—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Palt jumped as he came out of his room. He tried to hide the smoking spliff, but it was too late. Erin began to harangue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Problems. Lyonette was split between serving guests and eying the Earthers. Erin would do her best, but what &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; they do? Really? She'd have to think about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For now—this was the inn. Hexel slithered to the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Lyon? A pleasure. Can we enter Liscor from here? I don't see my [Bodyguards]. Quite a displeasure, but I suppose this Liscor's Council isn't that fast on the job. Before I find work, we'll require it, Yemmi. Don't worry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He reassured one of the Lizardfolk. Lyonette pointed him to the hallway. Then she saw Rose come up behind her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me, Miss Barmaid? Where's the bathroom?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The—outside. The outhouses are over there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette stared after Rose. Yes, something indeed. But that was her world. Confusion, chaos—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And change. You got used to thinking on your feet, adapting. Even to—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph wandered behind the bar of the inn. He hunted around and then pulled out a bottle of gin. Lyonette and Erin both &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; at him. He cracked it open, and only then noticed the stares.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Oh. Sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette's jaw twitched. No, it was fine. Lay down the law. She just had to—she saw Imani, who'd also found the outhouse, unprompted, coming back to the table. She went to sit down and a little white Gnoll crept around her chair. Mrsha &lt;em&gt;yanked&lt;/em&gt; the chair back as Imani sat and the young woman went sprawling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mrsha!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll raced off as the others helped Imani up. Lyonette was about to scold when Drassi sidled into the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um, Lyonette?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What, Drassi?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Exasperated, the [Princess] turned. Drassi pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have a situation. Should I let everyone in?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everyone…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then Lyonette saw them. In Invrisil, in &lt;em&gt;The Players' Retreat,&lt;/em&gt; there was a crowd. Of people. About…oh, four hundred strong. Lined up at the door as Redit the [Bouncer] kept them out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All with the six-silver passage fee to Liscor. [Traders], [Merchants], pedestrians who stared at Drassi and murmured—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Curious Humans. Tourism had come to Liscor. Lyonette stared at the open door. And if she'd been someone else she might have thrown up her hands, panicked, or just frozen. But the [Princess] had been here a while. She just sighed, rolled up her sleeves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And got to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm was hungry as he waited in line for one of the street-stalls. No restaurants; he didn't have the time for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Or the coin, frankly. Olesm was paid decently well for a [Tactician] in a small city. And he'd had a small pay increase for his new class. But Liscor was not &lt;em&gt;rich.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The food on offer was, ironically, a hamburger. Copied from Erin. Only it wasn't a burger—more like a glazed boneless rib-inna-bun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It still smelled delicious. And if the stall-owner was actually a decent cook and not a mad sales-genius who could sell &lt;em&gt;vaguely&lt;/em&gt; meat-like products solely on the virtues of his sales craft—well, it was good enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a line, and Olesm was licking his lips and wondering if he could spring for &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; burgers. His stomach rumbled—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And at that precise moment, as he was drawing towards the front, a Street Runner raced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There you are! Strategist Olesm to City Hall at once! The Council needs you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? What for?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm's face fell. The Gnoll [Runner] shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Didn't say. They want you right away, though! Something about an [Architect]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, &lt;em&gt;scale cheese—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Drakes in line gagged and glared as Olesm ran off. The &lt;em&gt;[Architect]! &lt;/em&gt;He hadn't been more than introduced to the Lamia yesterday, but he'd totally forgotten after last night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He'd…had a lot to drink in between &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting to talk to Erin. It hadn't been that bad a night, but Olesm felt slower, stupider today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he had forgotten about Hexel. So—apparently—had the Council.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe I requested a group of &lt;em&gt;[Bodyguards]. &lt;/em&gt;Plural. Non-Drakes. I was quite happy with my residence, my travel notwithstanding. But I will require both. Today. If I am unsatisfied, I will, with great politeness, leave, because security is a pressing issue for my team. And the Guild of Builders in Baleros will hear of it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel was cheerfully threatening Liscor's Council in the morning. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; were eating. Olesm just stared at fresh meat pies that Krshia had provided to the Council.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As I was saying, Mister Hexel—that's an addition to the budget we haven't calculated."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then calculate it. And I need to begin redesigning the city. Shall we do it now? No? Ah—this must be the [Strategist]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel slithered backwards as Olesm, panting, raised one claw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—needed to see me, Councilmembers?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, ah, Olesm. Our [Strategist]. I think you met him yesterday, Mister Hexel? Olesm, Architect Quithail requires a [Bodyguard] escort. As [Strategist], please appoint one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism didn't meet the Lamia's eyes as he shuffled the papers. The Lamia gave Olesm a toothy smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Non-Drake. I'm sure you understand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, sir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young, blue-scaled Drake shifted uncomfortably. Not just because of Hexel's obvious distrust of Drakes and the story he'd heard last night. Being attacked by hostile Drake…[Bandits]. Yes, [Bandits]. Criminals. But the frightened Lizardfolk trio hid behind their boss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Olesm, please hire the [Bodyguards] immediately. Submit them for Architect Hexel's review, yes? We will begin discussing the plans for the new city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia dipped her head at Hexel. Olesm was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can uh—hire some adventurers? Or Watch Captain Zevara can appoint members of the Watch. The Watch will be cheaper by far—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He realized he was thinking out loud and blushed. Lism looked at his nephew, fond as ever, but impatient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's do that, then. Save the city coin. Now, we're rather pressed for time, Architect. We have a number of meetings with the High Command of &lt;em&gt;Walled Cities, &lt;/em&gt;not to mention our armies over this damned Antinium issue. Which I was right about, incidentally—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia audibly ground her teeth as Lism shot her a glare. The members of the Council rustled. Elirr, Raekea on one side were subdued. Alonna and Jeiss were worried, as were the traditionalist, and largely, useless two members of the Council, Tismel and Zalaiss, who tended to be overridden in most majority-votes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—so we really can't devote all the time to your work. But if you'd like to survey the city, we can meet tomorrow at—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism's little speech was interrupted by Hexel. The [Architect] calmly gestured, and one of his [Apprentices] put down a blueprint of the city. The illustration was in white, with colorful chalk additions on black, thick paper that could be easily adjusted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it was of Liscor. Olesm saw the city laid out perfectly in the blueprints. And then—he saw the new part of the city. What could be. But only for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because the map began to &lt;em&gt;glow. &lt;/em&gt;Hexel slithered back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Ambition Visualized]. I do not have time to waste &lt;em&gt;either,&lt;/em&gt; Councilmember. Allow me to present my view of Liscor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From the table rose the city. Olesm saw buildings and streets, devoid of people but beautifully detailed, as if drawn from above. The Council sat back as the [Architect] briskly pointed and another of his assistants moved around the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Observe. This is the city you requested, Councilmembers. A third of the city from the expansion point—here—with a focus on high-occupancy residential housing. I have already surveyed the city, or rather, one of my apprentices did last night. I note you've leased certain areas, and I can work around that. But this is the Liscor you asked me to design."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was beautiful. The city seamlessly expanded, the original western wall falling away to make Liscor wider. Olesm saw two parks, organized streets to prevent traffic jams from travel, even—as the map rose higher—an expanded network of the sewers!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alonna was impressed. The rest of the Council, even Tismel and Zalaiss, murmured in clear approval. This Liscor looked like the old one, which was, of course, what you wanted to see. It was just larger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's exactly what we paid for. New residential districts—which we'll be making &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; are affordable. So long as we get the new wall enchanted by Spring, it works! I suppose that will be a priority, er, Mister Hexel?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism jabbed at the map, watching his claw passing through a building with awe. The Lamia smiled as he looked from face to face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Certainly, my previous plans allowed for this design and a completion of the outer walls &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; by Spring. The city would need to hire a high-level [Enchanter] specializing in architectural enchantments, but I would be happy to stick to the plans I laid out. Or I would be. However, recent events have put more of a focus on—&lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt;, haven't they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council looked up sharply. So did Olesm, trying to edge around the side and get one of the meat pies Jeiss and the Gnolls were scarfing down. Hexel went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Antinium, I mean. And I will admit—&lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt; is something I have been thinking on as well, since my own encounter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He touched at the scar running down his face. The Council fell silent. Hexel looked around and smiled again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not that I bear anyone here a grudge. Did I mention the bodyguards? At least &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt;, one for each of my assistants. If you're using the Watch, I insist on Level 20 or higher. But I digress. If you'll look at this &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; plan, this is what I've come up with since last night. A work in progress, but—here we are."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Lizardgirl rolled out a map on top of the first one. The first overlay vanished. And Olesm—&lt;em&gt;gasped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;this?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia half-rose, staring at the new city rising from the map. It was completely different from the old. For one thing—it was a lot &lt;em&gt;taller&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A second level had been added to the city. Olesm saw aerial walkways, entire streets built above the first. Not all-encompassing—they were designed to allow passage from those above without casting too much shadow on the ground level people. But the apartments were twice as high. Hexel slithered around it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This takes lessons from Pallass. &lt;em&gt;Horrible&lt;/em&gt; issues with shadows from their upper floors. The design is somewhat Balerosian, but I've made as many concessions to Drake architecture as possible. Space for Gnollish aesthetics too. Under this design, the city does expand—but upwards as well as horizontally. It will triple your capacity when fully built."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You've expanded in &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; directions?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism stared upwards at the higher, burgeoning skyscrapers, and then to the sides. Olesm saw two walls had been replaced and expanded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. West and south. But that's because under the new plan—I would hope to remodel the walls. Note the height."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel pointed. Little numbers appeared where he did, and Olesm saw. The walls were now &lt;em&gt;fifty&lt;/em&gt; feet high. Not sheer vertical drops either, but slanted slopes, still very steep, but to allow for the height.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fifty-foot walls, which would put Liscor above most Drake cities in stature. Doubled landmass based on western and southern expansions, and a second layer of the city for increased usage of space. This is partly for efficiency's sake, but also to make room for the largest of the improvements—here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The city rotated. Olesm craned his neck and heard a sound. He looked down into the center of the new section of the city and saw…blue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water.&lt;/em&gt; Krshia stared into a huge, inland pool—no, lake. No—a sea. Okay, maybe a lake. But a vast one. And &lt;em&gt;deep!&lt;/em&gt; The sewer system ran around it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;this?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A lake. I've studied your spring rains, Councilmember."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel nodded to Jeiss. He gestured, and the view of the city enhanced around the lake. Olesm saw little fish swimming around it, a Gnoll fishing on one of the piers—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You want to build a lake &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; our city? What nonsense! Think of the flooding! The insects that would flock to it—the acid flies are already bad in the summer! This is nonsense!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tismel was aghast. Lism glanced up at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Councilmember Tismel, kindly shut up. This—is odd. But fascinating. Explain, er, Architect Hexel."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism sat back. The Lamia smiled at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; from Baleros, Councilmember…Tismel. I know about insects. This body of water would be exceptionally deep, and the surface area enchanted against pests. Regular ward spells, like the ones on your walls. But rather than considering insects—think of the &lt;em&gt;fish. &lt;/em&gt;Liscor actually exports a large amount of seafood in the spring. But your people don't have high-level [Fisher] classes because, of course, it's only in one season. Imagine that—all year round?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council did. They looked at each other. Alonna murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; deep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The proposed lake ran nearly three times as deep as Liscor was tall—and that was the new model. And the surface area was large as well. Hexel nodded, going on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is, Councilmember. But imagine this: free, fresh water so long as you manage it. A source of food, entertainment so long as you segregate the more dangerous fish populations from your recreational areas—and security."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Security? Against what? Oh—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism's eyes widened. Krshia murmured. She looked up sharply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Hive. You want to flood them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lamia smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Only as a last resort. But you asked for an [Architect], and I take &lt;em&gt;wars&lt;/em&gt; into account. The Antinium are an interesting foe. Obviously, I'd need enchanted stone to prevent sabotage; in fact, I'll need to completely redesign your sewer system and ensure everything's secure. Here, here and here—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He began rotating the map, showing highlighted weak points. The Council looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But the &lt;em&gt;cost—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tismel was spluttering. Hexel nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good point. Here is my revised budget—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed, and one of his Lizardfolk assistants held up a sheet of paper with the number written on it. The Council &lt;em&gt;gasped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Outrageous! &lt;/em&gt;We can't pay for that!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tismel, shut up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jeiss didn't look at the Drake. He was looking about, gauging opinions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Candidly, we do not have that coin, Architect Hexel. But is that a conservative estimate?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Elirr folded his paws together. Hexel grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Assuming no other additions? I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come up with this in one night. While I was drinking, Councilmember Elirr. I can envision a few more add-ons. But while it would be expensive, I can do it. If you feel able to finance this, I will begin work and only begin the most ambitious aspects once funding is secured. This is—humbly—just in the &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; phase."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council looked at each other. Krshia's eyes were bright with interest. So were Olesm's. He just stared at the lake. Imagine the possibilities! Who would have thought of it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rest of the Council was more reserved, though. Raekea raised a polite paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hrr. Begging your pardon, [Architect], but I see one flaw immediately. This water—where does it come from?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gestured at the lake. The others looked at her. Jeiss scratched at his neck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Rain, Raekea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll gave him a roll of the eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It would have to rain for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; as it does in the spring even to fill this a bit. And we would drain it if we relied on it for water, yes, Jeiss? Would we divert a river into this place? I do not see one—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Miss Raekea, you're thinking like an [Architect]. Happily, we do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need a river."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel beamed. He pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This lake would, in fact, make use of the Floodplain's ample groundwater. It might take a few [Hydromancers] to pull it up, but Liscor could be supplied on the water from your spring rains alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our what-water?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism looked blank. Hexel sighed and flicked a claw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where are the estimates of how much water Liscor receives? Your Floodplains…&lt;em&gt;flood&lt;/em&gt;, Councilmember Lism. Every year. And yet—it drains with unnatural speed. Where does the water go? Down. It has to be somewhere. I'd like to find it, and make use of it. As well as where all those fish go every spring. If you could tap into it, you'd have more water than you could ever dream of. And more water than the Antinium could handle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council fell silent. They looked at each other. The scope of Hexel's ambition took Olesm away. And yet—he didn't seem like he was exaggerating his abilities. He had the kind of confidence Olesm had learned to see, rather than bravado. Earned confidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I only worry that the Antinium will see this as a &lt;em&gt;definite&lt;/em&gt; sign of aggression."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alonna murmured. Lism snorted and folded his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They see it that way? They've already been &lt;em&gt;lying&lt;/em&gt; to us, Alonna. They don't have to know until we start digging. And—so what if they object? If they never attack, &lt;em&gt;everything's fine.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Unless we decide to flood them, yes, Councilmember Lism? I'm sure they trust your &lt;em&gt;honor&lt;/em&gt;, but the scenario exists. This is a matter to discuss."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia smiled toothily at Lism. He glowered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—the budget and this plan. And the Antinium! We're bringing it up with the army and the Walled Cities. Maybe this will get them to stop panicking. Er—Architect. Can you make sure the Antinium &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; cave in our walls?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. And if you'd like to talk about that, or other Antinium safeguards, by all means. That's what I'm here for. Pass me a meat pasty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lamia settled himself at the table. Tismel was still spluttering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But he's a &lt;em&gt;Lizardperson&lt;/em&gt;. Can we really trust him to make sure our walls are—secure?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The entire room fell silent. Hexel's eyes glittered and he watched the others' faces slowly. Krshia's brows drew together. But it was Lism's jaw who twitched. He looked at Hexel, and then around swiftly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alright. A quick vote since this is in debate. All in favor of &lt;em&gt;cancelling&lt;/em&gt; our agreement with Architect Hexel who has come from Baleros and represents the Builder's Guild because he's a Lizardperson?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one moved. Tismel's claw hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But &lt;em&gt;Lism—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shut up, Tismel. Alright, that's decided. Now, all in favor of throwing Tismel out of the window?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Six hands rose. Olesm saw Tismel blanch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;That's not an official vote! Don't you dare! I'm a Councilmember—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone call for Guardsman Relc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism looked past Tismel, ignoring the Drake's panic. And Olesm was proud of his uncle. Irascible as he was—Lism looked at Hexel's vision of Liscor. And that mattered more than a grudge between species. Jeiss coughed and looked at Hexel as Tismel fled the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's talk, [Architect]. The Antinium security issue is a large one. Can you point out weak spots? We have a…map of the Antinium tunnel network and dungeon, roughly. And it's concerning."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm had seen it too. Hexel winced as he saw the secret sketch Magnolia had provided Zevara and the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…may need to check your foundations. But the Antinium &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good at avoiding collapsing things when they don't want to. Can I safeguard against that? Give me enough enchanted stone, and I can. But your budget…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, I have some more notes on the city's defenses. Give me one second and I'll fetch them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young Drake's voice made everyone turn to look at him. Olesm had nearly been forgotten amid the talk. He had nearly reached a meat pie, one of the last ones left. Krshia blinked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Olesm? But what about Hexel's bodyguards?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—can send a letter to Watch Captain Zevara. But as Liscor's [Strategist]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He hesitated. The Council was looking at him. Lism, his uncle, looked kindly at Olesm. But even his eyes flickered to Hexel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; Grand Strategist Chaldion meeting with us later today. You should voice your opinions then, Olesm. Yes, but I think making Architect Hexel as comfortable as possible is most important. Tell Watch Captain Zevara to send her best. At least one Senior Guardsman. We'll call for you if Architect Hexel has any questions. And for that meeting with the other cities."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm's heart sank through his stomach and out his tail. He opened his mouth. He &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the [Strategist], though! The old Council would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; have sent him packing. But they let him do everything. This one?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He should stay. The Drake opened his mouth to insist—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And found himself hurrying towards the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll uh, send the [Bodyguards] here later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He muttered as he closed the door. The Council didn't take any notice. They were talking to Hexel and the Lamia, in his element, was answering back, making his apprentices run about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm stared at the closed doors. But he had &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; this city with Zevara. He had—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had lost it, hadn't he? The Council didn't need him because they were competent. And Olesm had lost Erin's friendship. He'd lost…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake turned and walked down the hallway. He passed Councilmember Tismel. The Drake fled from behind the potted plant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Don't you dare throw me out the window&lt;/em&gt; again!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Again? &lt;/em&gt;Olesm was too, suddenly, woebegone to even notice that. He walked out of the City Hall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They'd be talking to Grand Strategist Chaldion later today. And the other leaders of the Walled Cities. The [High Strategist] of Liscor's army. Of course he wasn't necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When had it all gone so wrong? Olesm had become a [Strategist]. Ilvriss had called him a &lt;em&gt;prodigy.&lt;/em&gt; He had the attention of Niers Astoragon—Olesm still wore the Ring of Sight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But what had happened?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had sided against Erin, that was what had happened. And the chess magazines had ceased. The Drake had begun hiding from the Mage's Guild and the City Runners who sent letters demanding to know when the next magazine episode was coming out. Because how could he run it without &lt;em&gt;her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm had found his job was more…mundane. He'd made a mistake. And suddenly, the whirlwind of events that had spun around Erin ceased to include him. Because she had made him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And without her?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A little blue errand-bug scurried out of City Hall. It went to the Watch House and Zevara agreed to assign Beilmark and five other Gnolls and Humans to security. Then the blue insect walked outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Olesm realized he was hungry. He hadn't even had breakfast. And since…he wasn't needed, he walked back towards Market Street to go buy some. Not The Wandering Inn. After all—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was just another customer there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Part of it was depression. Self-hatred. Lack of confidence. A Drake louse scurried into the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another part of it was anger. Frustration. Uncertainty. A sense of—weakness, coupled with a problem she didn't want to have. Erin Solstice threw up her hands as she tried to argue with Montressa, tell the other people from Earth to &lt;em&gt;shut up—&lt;/em&gt;and failed to get the irony in that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Different people. Different problems. But that was the thing. Sometimes, the days were glorious without flaw—but seldom. Even the clearest skies usually came only after rain. Usually, the cleanest glass had a bit of microscopic dust or smudge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone knocked over a neat pyramid of neatly de-cored Amentus Fruits as Olesm entered the market. It was an accident; a bump against the table. It happened. Olesm heard the [Shopkeeper]'s aggrieved shout.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice dragged Montressa upstairs to negotiate about why all the Earthers were off-limits. The Earthers looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wow. That was a Minotaur."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Minotaur&lt;em&gt;ess&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—we're staying here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Guess so. Let's look around. They call this place the 'Floodplains'. Come on. We'll get out of Erin's hair. She looks busy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They got up and left the inn, and no one noticed for a good ten minutes in the rush. By the time Erin went to look for them to explain about Wistram—they were gone. Wandering the &lt;em&gt;perfectly safe&lt;/em&gt; Floodplains. Erin began to curse in a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; uncharacteristic manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And at that moment the magical door opened, as the [Innkeeper] was preparing to leave. And a woman walked into the inn and put it to a standstill. She wore not the yellow tracksuit of yesterday, but her hair was still styled. Lady Pryde looked around the inn with narrowed eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The little bug heard a furious voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You! You ruined my stock! You damned—someone call the Watch! Is there a [Guardsman]?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And everyone looked at him. All the bug-Drake wanted was some food. The inn was unguarded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was times like these, when the deck was stacked against you, a single face, a single card could turn the tides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like a [Lady]. Let alone a [Princess].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm Swifttail heard a young woman arguing with the irate Gnoll. He found the crowd nudging him out of line, as a member of Liscor's law enforcement, to deal with the problem. He just wanted his sandwich.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then he turned and saw her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her hair was mussed, disorderly from sharing a room with Ceria on a floor-mattress. She was in the same clothes as yesterday since her clothing—and her money pouch had been stolen by Thomast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even so, her hair was black and orange. And she burned like fire. The [Lady] was speaking slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. It was an accident."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Accident? Who cares? That's my &lt;em&gt;stock!&lt;/em&gt; Now it's bruised! You Humans think you can just damage someone's business and walk off? This is why I voted for Lism!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll was haranguing her. The young woman was scooping down to pick up the Amentus Fruits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get your paws off them! And pay for those!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll [Shopkeeper] was having a bad day. She glared about as her customers called out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Leave off. They're just dusty, Berri."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Shut up.&lt;/em&gt; Where's a [Guardsman]? I want recompense."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. But I don't have any money."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El gestured to her missing money pouch. That was actually the wrong thing to say. The crowd instantly turned suspicious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not one copper penny?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are you in Market Street, then?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Looking around. Looking for work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] defended herself. But the memory of the Human [Thief] was working against her. The Gnoll [Shopkeeper] looked furiously around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where's a [Guardsman]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here's Olesm!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone called out and pointed at Olesm. The Drake jumped. He was drooling at the blue fruits. The Gnoll brightened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Olesm! Just the Drake I wanted! Sort this out, please? This Human knocked over my stall! And she's &lt;em&gt;loitering&lt;/em&gt; about here without a penny in her pockets, or so she says! Just like the last [Thief]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh—hello, everyone. What seems to be the problem, Miss…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm halted. He blinked at Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um. Do I know you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola turned. She smiled, relieved. But only a bit relieved; she didn't seem worried, despite the very angry Gnoll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I daresay you might. Didn't we drink together? Olesm Swifttail? Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. You beat me in chess. And—right, you know the Horns."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Shopkeeper] hesitated as Olesm nodded to Maviola and she smiled. This was not how the confrontation in her head had played out. She coughed, trying to be polite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strategist? This Human bumped over my stock."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—right. Miss Maviola, did you, in fact, intend to steal or knock over Miss Berri's stock?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm sighed. Maviola shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But she could just be &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; that. The last Human was a thief! Stole from Honored Krshia and blew up the—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Berri protested, and then tried to eat her tongue. But the other customers were somewhat on her side. Olesm sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why don't we test this via truth stone? We'll have to flag down a Senior Guardsman or go to the barracks. Miss Maviola? If you'll come with me, we can go back there. It won't take long. And you're not under arrest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And maybe I can get some breakfast. &lt;/em&gt;The Drake thought internally. He tried to hold out a claw to her. But Maviola refused. She pointed at the Amentus Fruits and raised her chin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That was an accident. I've apologized, but I've stolen nothing. Why must I be escorted to the Watch on the merest claim that I 'might' have been doing something? Has anything been stolen in Market Street? Is it a crime to walk around here without money?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist]'s brows knitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Why was she being stubborn about this? But the [Lady]'s orange eyes flashed as she looked at Berri.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"An accident &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an accident. It seems to me those fruits would fall over if anyone bumped into that stall. They already looked bruised to me. But it seems because I am Human, I'm being singled out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll woman growled at her. Olesm's head began to hurt again. Nothing was ever &lt;em&gt;simple.&lt;/em&gt; He looked helplessly at Miss Berri and decided he was too hungry for this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know what? That's true. An accident is an accident. Miss Berri, why don't we call this a simple misunderstanding. I can pay for Miss Maviola since we know each other. Here—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He dug out four coppers and winced. He'd only meant to pull out two; he wasn't even &lt;em&gt;buying&lt;/em&gt; one. But Berri's face broke into a smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I appreciate that, Strategist Olesm. A credit to the city, and kind too! Yes, I can forgive—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached out as Olesm proffered the coins. And Maviola slapped down Olesm's wrist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Now what?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm lost his temper. He rounded on Maviola. But her eyes just glittered as she looked at Berri.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will not let you give her money for an accident and a crime I didn't commit. &lt;em&gt;I did nothing wrong.&lt;/em&gt; I demand that you arrest me, &lt;em&gt;Strategist Olesm&lt;/em&gt;, or resolve this. Because this is not justice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His jaw dropped. So did Berri's. But the young woman just stood there. And the look in her eyes said that she would rather be arrested than let a single copper coin go to Berri.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like contained fire. From her hair to her eyes, Maviola El blazed with passion, even in the early morning. Even in the light. She looked at Olesm and he saw her burning indignation. Because she was right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the fire burned deeper still. And Olesm looked at Maviola. And at that moment—he and perhaps other shoppers in Market Street remembered something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another young woman. An angry Drake, overcharging prices. And to settle it, a chess game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm's eyes brightened. The fog of hunger and depression rose for a second. And for the first time that day, he began to &lt;em&gt;think.&lt;/em&gt; He turned back to Berri. The Gnoll [Shopkeeper] was spluttering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She wants to be stubborn? Fine! Summon a [Guard]! Waste of time on everyone's part if you ask me—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Berri. As [Strategist] of Liscor, I am authorized to arrest civilians. Is it your wish to charge Miss Maviola with damage of property?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm snapped. The Gnoll and the crowd fell silent. Berri hesitated. But she was in too far. Her chin rose as she looked at Olesm challengingly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. My fruits &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; damaged, accidentally or not. Shouldn't I be recompensed for that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. That is your right, as is your right to level a charge that the Watch should investigate. Thus—&lt;em&gt;excuse me!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned and waved his claws over his head. The people amid the bustling street looked around. Maviola glanced at Olesm. And her eyes lit up as the Drake shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Would everyone who has &lt;/em&gt;ever&lt;em&gt; bumped into Miss Berri's stall and knocked over the Amentus Fruits please step forwards? Today or in the past?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crowd of people on the street looked about. The wise ones didn't raise their hands or step forwards. But at least fourteen innocent, good citizens of Liscor did. After all, Miss Berri had sold fruits here for years. Olesm beamed at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excellent. Well then, I am arresting you all for complaint of damage to property at Miss Berri's insistence. Please follow me to the Watch House and we will make sure none of you intentionally damaged her goods. After that, we will determine if you must pay a small fine—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A shout came from the crowd. Berri raised her paws, looking very worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I never said that! I just said this Human—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She tried to point at Maviola. Olesm turned to Berri.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Berri, that Human is a pedestrian on the streets. Is there a difference between the accident she caused or the accident a Gnoll shopper might cause? Or a Drake one?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—well—she's &lt;em&gt;Human—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm looked at Berri as she trailed off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—if the shopper was a Gnoll, the situation would be different? What about a Drake?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, exactly! Thank you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake [Strategist] hadn't been prepared for that. His jaw worked as Berri looked relieved. But some of the crowd understood his point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stop blaming Humans for your stupid display, Berri!&lt;/em&gt; You're wasting all our time!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Drake customers shouted at her. Another Gnoll shouted his agreement. Berri's ears flattened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you withdraw the complaint?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm nodded. He looked at the triumphant Maviola, who was not hiding her pleasure. But the Drake looked around the street, speaking to the Gnoll and the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Berri, if you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a complaint, don't hesitate to register it with a [Guard]. Especially if a Human [Thief] appears in the market. But that goes for any [Thief] of any species. Humans are new to the city. But that is all. The law makes no distinction between them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll didn't reply. The members of the crowd watched Olesm step back. He gestured to Maviola and they walked away. In the silence, one of the Drakes murmured to his companion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, &lt;em&gt;Ancestors.&lt;/em&gt; That was kind of harsh, don't you think?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Humans. Well, he is friends with that crazy one. Say, can I get two Amentus Fruits? Not the bruised ones. Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the crowd shifted to supporting the downtrodden Berri.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That Olesm. Not always the nicest of sorts. He had a point, but did he &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to embarrass Berri, make a speech?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"His new class has gone to his head, what? I remember that nice young Drake boy…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyone know where the carrots are for sale?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Selys groaned as Hawk waved his paw around vaguely. The crowd murmured. After a few seconds, some of them began to shout at Olesm's back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;You couldn't win them all. Olesm heard the people hurling insults at his back and high-tailed it out of Market Street. &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; thought he'd done a good job. But one of the said Amentus Fruits even went soaring after his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He started running and only stopped when he heard the laughter. Maviola was hurrying after him, but she was laughing as she ran.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The pure amusement in her voice made Olesm stop and grin ruefully. He saw her glance behind him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No mob. We're safe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two caught their breaths. Olesm looked at Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. I thought that really worked."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was a good speech. But did you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; expect them to suddenly stop disliking Humans? You made a huge scene and humiliated that poor Gnoll."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm's jaw dropped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because you &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; me to!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not to do it that way! And if you &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; going to make a scene, you should always have a way out. In case it fails! Otherwise you and I could have been beaten to pulp with—fruits!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She laughed merrily at him. Olesm hadn't considered that. Berri was a Gnoll woman—which meant bigger than Maviola and Olesm. She could probably pluck their heads off like grapes and put them on her counter if she got mad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—I've never done that before! I did my best, alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And I'm grateful. I didn't knock over the fruits on purpose, by the way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake looked stupidly at her. The [Lady] brushed her dress and glanced about. She opened her mouth as Olesm tried to say something about inclusivity and how Liscor wasn't used to Humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I-"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Their stomachs both &lt;em&gt;rumbled.&lt;/em&gt; The Drake and young woman paused. And then they started chuckling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. I haven't had anything to eat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me neither. My money pouch got stolen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no. In the city? We can report it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Invrisil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola waved it off. She bent down, dusted something off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyways, I found breakfast. I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; looking for work as a [Stall Attendant] or something, but since that's out—want to share?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She offered the cored Amentus Fruit to Olesm. He blinked at it. It was only slightly bruised and Maviola bit into it with clear delight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sweet!&lt;/em&gt; And so delicious. You know, these sell for &lt;em&gt;gold&lt;/em&gt; up north? Well, the poison is deadly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's all in the core. And if you're hungry, want some breakfast? I need to get some. Now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman looked at Olesm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't pay for myself. I was going to have to go back to the inn and ask the Horns. I was actually hoping to look around the city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I know it like the back of my tail. Been here all my life. Come on—they're selling burgers this way. Well—ribs in a bun. I'll treat you. We do know each other, after all. Don't worry; they're really cheap."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola smiled as Olesm pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you. Well, I'll share my breakfast too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What b—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She popped the other half of the Amentus Fruit into Olesm's mouth. He blinked. It was &lt;em&gt;sweet!&lt;/em&gt; And only a bit gritty. The [Lady] walked past him, looking at the expression on his face with amusement. The Drake stared at her back. And then followed after. There was something about Maviola that made you want to learn about her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was familiar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Pryde Ulta stood in the inn. Erin froze with her hand on the doorknob. The [Lady of Pride] looked around, and her eyes flashed imperiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was the same as she'd been just yesterday. Erin stared at her. And the inn fell silent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get. Out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] glanced at Erin. The Earthers were gone; Erin had just been about to go after them. Lyonette froze as she edged out of the kitchen with an extra-large pie for Moore; the Halfseekers had come through the door just a moment ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A curious inn. I don't see why Magnolia is so obsessed with this place. However—it has some interesting qualities. Innkeeper, how much would you take for this door? Eighty thousand gold pieces? Name your price. If it is within reason, we may come to an arrangement. I have other objects I would like to purchase—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice strode up to Pryde. And the air was suddenly stifling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're not welcome here. &lt;em&gt;Get out.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time the [Lady] heard her, or acknowledged she'd heard. Her eyes narrowed slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Insolence. I am Lady Pryde Ulta. No one tells me where to go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh yeah?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As dialogue went, that last part fell flat. But Pryde was holding still. And Erin—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is my inn. You can't come in here. You're not buying the door. And you and Magnolia—all of you are on my &lt;em&gt;bad list.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde just ignored that. She turned her head. And then began to walk past Erin, towards one of the doors. Just like that. Erin's eyes bulged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I said, &lt;em&gt;stop.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time Lyonette &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; the aura condensing around Pryde. The [Lady] nearly stumbled. She turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So, the [Innkeeper] does have thorns. But you wouldn't have stopped me, even alone. Girl. I am a [Lady] of Izril. I will excuse your foul manners. Once. Do not&lt;em&gt; test&lt;/em&gt; me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh yeah?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time the [Lady of Pride]'s eyes narrowed. Lyonette felt the gathering aura against the door. She looked for Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mrsha—&lt;/em&gt;oh no. Mrsha, get over here!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll looked up. She scampered over. Lyonette seized her, and then &lt;em&gt;tossed&lt;/em&gt; her. Mrsha went flying through the [Garden of Sanctuary] with a yelp. Lyonette slammed the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the inn, Pryde's aura was gathering around her. Someone had &lt;em&gt;taught&lt;/em&gt; her. She brushed off Erin's aura, began to overpower the [Innkeeper]. Erin's eyes went wide. She pushed back, but the [Lady]'s atmosphere was overpowering. That was pride, manifest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't make me discipline you. I might admire your spirit. In fact, I rather do. But I require respect first."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde half-smiled as the air began to shake around Erin. Then someone coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. That's our friend. If she says you're not welcome, get out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The air turned &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;. Lyonette saw-felt a &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; aura merging, freezing the air around Pryde. She saw Ceria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, no, you idiot—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde glanced at the frost growing on her clothing. She &lt;em&gt;tsked&lt;/em&gt;. The Horns were on their feet. So were the Halfseekers. Griffon Hunt were more indecisive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Don't be an idiot, Moore! That's a [Lady]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi hissed at the half-Giant. But he was carefully edging around the table. Yvlon walked forwards, her hands raised placatingly as Pisces stealthily moved around Pryde's back. Ksmvr pulled out a crossbow and Halrac grabbed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Ulta, please calm down. This is not your land. Miss Solstice is the owner of the inn. Her word is law."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde glanced at Yvlon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yvlon Byres."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A minor house's daughter. You have only a scrap of our class. And you have no right to lecture me on my authority. Be silent."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Armsmistress]'s eyes blazed. She took a step forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We will back up Erin's words. Please reconsider."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria was freezing the air colder and colder. Not dangerously cold yet; but she was warning Pryde. Lyonette hesitated. This was bad. Ceria was like Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not how you fight with auras—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Pryde turned her head, saw Pisces and Ksmvr trying to sneak up on her from behind. Her eyes flashed with anger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Enough of this. You want to challenge me, children. Fine. &lt;em&gt;Challenge me.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon, striding for Pryde, suddenly &lt;em&gt;froze.&lt;/em&gt; The aura spread out, immobilizing Ksmvr, Pisces, Ceria—it &lt;em&gt;squashed&lt;/em&gt; Ceria's elemental aura. And the air around Pryde turned golden, taking on an ethereal tinge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no. She's got control, potency, and &lt;em&gt;manifestation.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette groaned. Erin staggered as everyone in the inn felt an overwhelming, yet invisible weight &lt;em&gt;pushing&lt;/em&gt; them down. Pryde's ego was weight. Lyonette herself had to gather her aura and &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; against the intensity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But—Erin still moved. She looked around her staggering friends. A copy of yesterday. And she lost her temper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Enough.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed. Lyonette saw the air &lt;em&gt;ripple.&lt;/em&gt; Both she and Pryde blinked. But the [Lady] went stumbling back a few steps. Pryde caught herself, formed a shield. Erin blinked. She'd just manifested her aura!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Interesting. You want to make this a competition? Show me what makes Magnolia so fascinated."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Pryde's aura intensified. But this was Erin's land. The young woman pushed back. And the two personalities met in the center of the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was something Lyonette could sense. To many, it was just an invisible staring contest. But no—you could feel it in the air, like two hostile intentions. And it was actually affecting the air between them. Shimmering where the auras met.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's…happening?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi whispered. She didn't quite understand. But Halrac was staring at the two; the [Scout] could see almost as well as Lyonette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone could feel an aura. Everyone could use an aura. If you had ever engaged in a hostile staring contest—that was two auras clashing. But this was that natural ability multiplied a thousand times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette saw Erin struggling against Pryde. The [Lady] was locking down everyone around her, but that was more of a side-effect. The two were battling it out and the Horns were frozen. They might have moved. Pisces might have flicked his glowing [Shatterbolt] ring. But that was—too—hostile. This was a [Lady]'s battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And an [Innkeeper] was matching her in her inn. It was &lt;em&gt;close.&lt;/em&gt; They went back and forth; Pryde had experience, a more powerful class and a more distinguished aura.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this was Erin's inn. And she was &lt;em&gt;mad.&lt;/em&gt; The two glared at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ridiculous."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde's eyes narrowed as she tried to squash Erin and found the young woman pushing at &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; Erin was biting her lip hard enough to draw blood. The [Innkeeper]'s focus was slipping. But—she balled a hand into a fist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is my inn. You want to get mean?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She began walking forwards. Lyonette saw Erin raising her fist. Pryde saw it, and smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Pride is Unbreakable]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She began walking forwards too. They were on a collision course. And the clash of auras was about to get &lt;em&gt;physical.&lt;/em&gt; But Pryde was supremely confident in her defensive Skill. And Lyonette, looking between them, wondered what she could do. If she threw her power behind Erin—but she could barely push Pryde off her!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Push. Wait a second&lt;/em&gt;…Lyonette's eyes widened. Abruptly, the [Princess]' back straightened. She felt the pressure lift. &lt;em&gt;Of course! &lt;/em&gt;Erin had no idea, and neither did Pryde! Lyonette saw Erin raising a fist and ran.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Erin!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She &lt;em&gt;shoved&lt;/em&gt; Erin aside. The [Innkeeper] went 'bwuh', and sprawled onto the ground. Lyonette saw Pryde blink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The pressure on Erin relented—slightly. Erin scrambled up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lyonette! Get out of the way! I'm gonna punch her—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin Solstice. We have bigger issues! Go after the Ear—go after Rose and the others! They're in the Floodplains, remember?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette snapped at the [Innkeeper]. Erin blinked. She glanced at the door, and then at the confused Pryde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Go.&lt;/em&gt; I'll handle things here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette saw Erin hesitate, weigh the odds of Joseph and the others being in trouble, look at Pryde. Then she cursed and ran. Erin only stopped at the door to point at Pryde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This isn't over! &lt;em&gt;Dun, dun, d—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She slammed the door. Pryde stared after her, and then at Lyonette. Her aura was still crushing everyone around her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gah! Why can't I—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria was on her knees. She was being completely shut down. Even Yvlon was struggling to stay upright. But Lyonette? Pryde focused on the [Princess]. And Lyonette's knees didn't so much as buckle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And who are you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette du Marquin stood in front of Lady Pryde Ulta. She took a deep breath. And then she smoothly curtsied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lyon, Lady Pryde! So sorry about that. I'm the inn's [Manager] and [Head Barmaid], under Miss Solstice. How can I help you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] blinked. The aura…slowly relaxed. She turned her head, eyed Lyonette a few times, and then sniffed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, someone has politeness and a spine. I'll conduct my business myself. Tell that impudent [Innkeeper]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With that she turned away and walked through one of the side doors. Lyonette exhaled, slowly. She felt everyone begin breathing, talking again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods damn it, I couldn't do anything! Again!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria got up, breathing hard. She looked at Lyonette. Then at Pryde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're just letting her go?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Would &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; like to throw her out? I'll follow her, make sure nothing else happens. Mrsha! You can come in, but don't you dare cause trouble!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha was peeking at Lyonette wide-eyed through the Garden of Sanctuary. The others saw Lyonette clap her hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry for the interruption, everyone! Won't happen again—hopefully. Back to work!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They all looked at the [Princess]. Yvlon, panting, eyed Lyonette. She asked the question that Mrsha and the others dearly wanted to know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You just interrupted both Erin &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Pryde. She tried to squash you, Lyonette. I'm no expert—I'm a Level 4 [Lady]. But how did you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette just winked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aura battles aren't pure force, Yvlon. Ceria, you need practice. Just like Erin. As for how—that's my secret. Come on, Mrsha!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She scooped Mrsha up and followed after Pryde. The Gnoll patted Lyonette on the head urgently. She signed with her paws, practically begging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;How did you do that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette saw Mrsha pleading for the answer. So she lowered her voice as she followed Pryde and whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Easy, Mrsha. I just know about auras. Pryde is stronger, more skillful than Erin and me. But you know what? &lt;em&gt;I outrank her.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was all about perspective. Once Lyonette shifted her own authority, Pryde was aiming at the wrong target. There was nothing like a secret [Princess] when someone pulled out a [Lady].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But round two was just beginning. Lyonette wiped sweat from her brow. She hurried down the main hallway. Pryde was going through one of the side doors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Pryde! How can I help—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The magic door opened and a Drake strode through. An absolute unit. Grimalkin the Fist Mage made the Gnolls look small and skinny. He was already in an irritable mood. But he was unfailingly…Grimalkin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Miss Lyonette. Excellent. I must speak to Erin Solstice at once. About the Antinium issue."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grimalkin! I mean, Magus—now is not a good time. Erin's outside and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is she? I'll find her. I'd also like to confer with Watch Captain Zevara before I leave. The Walled Cities are debating on the Liscorian issue…excuse me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin turned towards the door. Lyonette's eyes widened. She could see the future. Grimalkin would find Erin in a moment. And the Earthers. And knowing them—they hadn't been briefed yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Magus Grimalkin, now's really not a good time—Erin's in the middle of something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"When is she not? I'll be brief, but I must insist—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin went for the door. Lyonette took a deep breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I said, &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake halted in his tracks. He looked over his shoulder. And the [Princess]'s aura caught and held him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What are you doing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young Human woman smiled at him as Mrsha smirked at Grimalkin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magus Grimalkin. While I appreciate the severity of your needs, Erin is &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt; with a pressing task. It is somewhat rude to interrupt her. Is your task &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; or just pressing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake's jaw worked a few times. He hesitated. And Lyonette looked at him. Her aura didn't &lt;em&gt;hold&lt;/em&gt; him down like Pryde and Erin did. It just pushed one thing onto him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was being rather unmannerly. The [Sinew Magus] coughed, checked himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could—wait. Yes. I'll—see Miss Solstice at her leisure. Once this pressing issue is dealt with. You understand my concern?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. And she will see you &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; after she is free. I'll convey that to her myself. Would you like to wait in the inn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Er…yes. Yes, before the Watch Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sinew Magus] stepped back from the door. Lyonette felt more energy leave her as she released her aura. But Mrsha was giving her Human mother another awed look. Power was more than muscle. Grimalkin was &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; muscle. But he had little experience with noble classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course, you could mostly get around that because on the &lt;em&gt;battlefield&lt;/em&gt;, all these diplomatic tricks didn't stop an arrow going through your head. Except in Pryde's case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And speaking of her…Lyonette hurried after Pryde. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; she up to? Lyonette peeked around the inn, worried. Was she after one of the Antinium? Oh no. Where was Bird? Numbtongue? Was she—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde was in one of the inn's newest rooms. The weights room. Grimalkin's new weights and exercise machines were all set up. And the [Lady] was staring at a poster Grimalkin had worked up showing how to properly do a deadlift. She was holding one of the larger barbells casually in one arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, you again. These are intriguing. They're for building muscle, aren't they? I want them. Where do they come from and how much are they? Never mind. I'll buy these."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde turned to Lyonette as the young woman entered the room. Mrsha padded in after her, wrinkling her nose. It always smelled vaguely of sweat in here. Lyonette blinked at Pryde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—want these?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Sell them to me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] looked at the [Princess]. She narrowed her eyes and Lyonette felt an experimental &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt;. For a moment she &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to sell the weights. Well—she still did. But the [Princess] had her pride. She took a breath, restrained her vexation, and smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She rather enjoyed saying that. Pryde blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll buy them for twice of whatever they were sold to you for."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Again, the [Princess] fought. Internally, her mercantile side said 'yes, absolutely'! But part of her, the [Princess] part, said—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Lady Pryde. These are the property of The Wandering Inn. They cannot be sold, even to a [Lady] of Izril. I am &lt;em&gt;so sorry.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was so funny. Lyonette loved money. But this was her inn. No one walked in and made demands of her. She ignored Pryde's aura; the [Lady] was still looking at her like a [Barmaid].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But this was hers, too.&lt;/em&gt; The [Lady of Pride] &lt;em&gt;concentrated&lt;/em&gt;, and then looked exasperated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I want these. Where do they come from. What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A little bell rang in Lyonette's head. The [Princess] smiled widely. She looked over her shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Actually, Lady Pryde—I think I can put you in touch with the creator himself. One moment?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hurried out of the room. Lady Pryde opened her mouth. And then she turned and stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha was trying to bench press a miniature weights bar. She gave Pryde a challenging look. Even Pryde needed a moment for that. Cuteness could overpower even pride.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin was still pacing back and forth in the hallway, muttering to himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Auras. Damn formality Skills. Should I go after Miss Solstice? But there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; such a thing as politeness—which is of course, how the Skills work. If I was a savage-minded person with no manners, I'd be practically immune…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He jumped as Lyonette opened one of the secret side-doors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magus Grimalkin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I haven't &lt;em&gt;left. &lt;/em&gt;Wait, is Miss Solstice back yet?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned on her, expectantly. Lyonette smiled at Grimalkin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Actually, &lt;/em&gt;not that I want to distract you, but I have someone asking about buying some of your weights. She's &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; intrigued. Could you spare a moment to speak to Lady Pryde Ulta?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Pryde—one of the [Ladies] is here? Show me, yes, absolutely."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin strode into the weights room after Lyonette. Pryde was experimentally loading up her own weights bar. Mrsha was helping her slot some of the heavier lead weights into place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both caught sight of each other at the same time. Pryde straightened and Grimalkin folded his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They practically said the same thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Pryde, may I introduce Magus Grimalkin of Pallass? He created the weights you see here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin opened his mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"May I ask what a [Lady] is doing in Liscor? Miss Pryde?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde's eyes flashed again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lady Pryde.&lt;/em&gt; And I came here to investigate this…contraption. I saw it yesterday, but I was occupied with Magnolia's plan. What is this for? To build muscle?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin was opening his mouth. Then—he blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, of course. This is my revolutionary weights-system. And this is a—gymnasium. To build muscle, in a controlled environment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Why haven't I heard of this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a new invention."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin shot back. He glanced at Pryde's weight bar dismissively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The techniques are completely revolutionary. My concept with some help from a…significant source. Each muscular group can be worked on without the need for sparring or general training. This is an…&lt;em&gt;academic&lt;/em&gt; approach to improving one's body. But it is in development still. Please don't try lifting that bar, Miss Pryde."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] saw the Drake glance at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's far too heavy for your muscular mass. The weights are designed to be used incrementally. You'd want to reduce, oh, eighty pounds from that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gave Pryde a dismissive look up and down. The [Lady] wasn't wearing the tracksuit, but she was wearing loose, travel or athletic clothes. She didn't look a tenth as muscular as Grimalkin. However, at Grimalkin's words, Pryde's head snapped up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that a challenge?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, a fact. I warn you—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too late. Pryde bent down. A bit uncertainly—she bent down. And then picked the weights bar up and &lt;em&gt;heaved&lt;/em&gt; it onto her shoulders to do a squat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette and Grimalkin stared. Mrsha's jaw dropped. Pryde eyed the poster on the wall, and imitated a squat. The weights bar—which had to have over two hundred pounds on it, balanced on her shoulders as she did one squat. Then two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Too heavy, you said?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] looked at Grimalkin. The weight was clearly heavy on her, but she was managing it. Grimalkin scratched at his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not…are you using magic? An aura?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He squinted at her. Pryde just smirked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't need either. I keep myself &lt;em&gt;fit. &lt;/em&gt;House Ulta's retainers have strict training and I've ensured their regimen is second to none. And gone through it myself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But how—ah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin saw Pryde carefully hooking the weights bar on the squat rack; then the woman's clothes moved. Lyonette saw abdominal muscle. Mrsha squinted at Pryde's arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Compressed Muscle]. Of course. A [Lady]'s Skill. I haven't seen that Skill in—years. It's not common."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake eyed Pryde. She smirked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A gift from my mother. House Ulta has always been in &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; physical shape."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bloodline breeding?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not a concept most Drakes know about. I see you have some muscle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin &lt;em&gt;harrumphed&lt;/em&gt;. He and Pryde stared at each other, appraising each other a second time. Lyonette slowly beckoned towards Mrsha; the Gnoll was trying to pump a barbell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—I can see I've misjudged you, Lady Ulta. But these weights are only being tested in Drake lands. I have yet to perfect the regimen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? I want them. My [Warriors] could use them. I've been looking for ways to improve their strength. Do you have more aids in building muscle? Why have I not heard of these weights before? I don't keep up on Drake politics."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, they are &lt;em&gt;cutting-edge.&lt;/em&gt; New. And I haven't been advertising—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sinew Magus] hesitated. He blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did you say you wanted to know more about strength building?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did you mishear me? Unless you don't have anything else?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] looked archly at Grimalkin. Lyonette grinned and closed the door. Now, that wasn't a [Princess]'s power. That was just misdirection. And she had learned &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; trick from—Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lyonette, what's up with that [Lady]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All sorted, Drassi. Ishkr, they're in the weights room. Bring in some sliced oranges and water for them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette exhaled as she came back into the common room. Pawn and some of the Antinium were in the common room. She exclaimed as she saw them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Pawn! &lt;/em&gt;What happened to you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We were pelted with trash on our way out of the Hive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Priest] was picking a rag off his antennae. Two of his Workers smelled as though they'd been doused by…chamber pots. Lyonette's brows drew together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Those—are you hurt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not physically. But I am somewhat irritable."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Priest] replied. Lyonette saw Ishkr wrinkling his nose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drassi, get the oranges and water for Pryde and Grimalkin. Ishkr—water? Soap?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Miss Lyonette."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry, Pawn. We can move the door or—make a new one so that doesn't happen. What's it like in Liscor? Hold on, I'll get you some towels—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette walked past a table. And then abruptly, collapsed onto it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lyonette?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll blinked as Lyonette caught herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whoops, slipped. I'm fine, Ishkr."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette smiled at Ishkr—and then abruptly, sat back in her chair. Everything &lt;em&gt;spun. &lt;/em&gt;Lyonette's face turned pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lyonette!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha and Pawn &lt;em&gt;sprinted&lt;/em&gt; at Lyonette as Ishkr bent over her. The [Princess] felt everything going dark. She panted as Pawn seized her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Minor Heal—]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! I'm fine!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Urgently, Lyonette knocked away Pawn's hands. Everyone was watching! She panted as Mrsha grabbed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I just need to—rest. I used up my aura."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd never done that. Her &lt;em&gt;mother&lt;/em&gt; hadn't used her aura as much as that, not in all the years Lyonette had been at court. The [Princess] closed her eyes as the voices murmured around her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just give me—give me—one moment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her head lolled back. And she closed her eyes. The [Princess] passed out—just for a moment, before Mrsha shoved a stamina potion in her mouth. But that was all she needed. She heard that wonderful voice she'd been waiting for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Worldly Princess Level 20!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Skill—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At the same time that was happening, a [Lady] was listening to a Drake's woes. Maviola El savored her bites of the rib-burger as she walked across Liscor with Olesm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake was showing her around. Olesm really didn't have much to do—well, he had to attend the strategy meeting regarding the Antinium situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But what do I &lt;em&gt;do?&lt;/em&gt; I'm just a low-level [Strategist]. Grand Strategist Chaldion will be there. I mean—I've messed it all up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm was showing Maviola the park. She stopped, watching Ekirra throw Visma &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; the top of the park slide. The screaming Drake child plummeted to the ground before the safety spell caught her. Then she raced up and kicked Ekirra off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you're &lt;em&gt;Liscor's&lt;/em&gt; [Strategist]. You've done a lot for the city. Before this Council, you practically ran it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How do you know that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You told me last night. We played chess, remember?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. I uh—drank too much. Sorry. I'm whining, aren't I?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. The [Innkeeper] doesn't like you. That half-Elf doesn't &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; you. You don't get paid enough, the city's undefended against the Antinium—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola began counting Olesm's woes off on her fingers. He turned bright red under his scales. He'd told her all that yesterday? She grinned at his expression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm—sorry. I'll shut up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake turned away. &lt;em&gt;Idiot!&lt;/em&gt; But Maviola just pushed at his shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you know what your problem is, Olesm? You told me &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your problems yesterday. But you don't do anything &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] hunched his shoulders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? No, I mean, I can't fix Ceria not…and Erin—I burned the bridge with her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola rolled her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, yes. But those two aren't the biggest problems, are they? The Antinium was what I meant—but let's start with an easy one. You don't get paid enough?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…could use a bigger salary. I mean, it's decent. But I spend money on paper and ink for my personal notes. It's not that I &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;a lot more, it'd just be helpful. Did I mention that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm counted his coins. Even treating Maviola to a meal ticked his cash flow at the back of his head. Maviola smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Briefly. So if you need more money and you're working hard—why don't you &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; for it? Ask this Council."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The blue-scaled Drake hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I couldn't do that. They have so many budgetary needs, what with the city's construction and so forth—I don't need to add to that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] rolled her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And is your salary going to impact the &lt;em&gt;entire future of Liscor's construction?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She spread her arms to indicate the entire city, mockingly. Olesm blushed again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! But—it's petty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean, it's &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. Just ask. If they say no, that's it. But you don't ask. That's like your Antinium problem."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ow. What is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm backed up from the poking. Maviola looked at him, exasperated, but amused. Somehow—knowing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Forget about what this Grand Strategist can do. What can you, as the [Strategist] of Liscor, do? You're making a mistake of command: you think that if you can't fix &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, you should leave it to your superiors. That's idiotic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed down at the ground they stood on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You do the best job you can &lt;em&gt;in your position&lt;/em&gt;, and you inform those above you about what you can't do. You don't do &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; and wait for orders. If that's how you act, you don't deserve to even follow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her words were sharp and cut Olesm to the quick. What was worse—Maviola sounded like she knew exactly what she was talking about from personal experience. Olesm just looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, Ancestors. That makes so much sense."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mhm. Imagine that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She leaned on a sign in front of the public park. It read, &lt;em&gt;'Erin Solstice is banned from entry by order of the community and the Watch'&lt;/em&gt;. There had been a siege here, once. Children vs grownups. An epic battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Anyways. Olesm just looked at Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—I should be doing what I can that Chaldion can't do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Exactly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Which is…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She shrugged. The young woman gave Olesm a very blank look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have no idea. I'm not Liscor's [Strategist]. But what are the problems in Liscor that could be fixed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, well—so many. The Humans coming into Liscor—that's an issue you highlighted this morning. I had this chess magazine, and that's more personal, but it was actually putting Liscor on the map. But I don't talk to Erin. And there's the budget—if I could help with that—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment Olesm felt that helplessness set in. How did you fix any of that? He began to feel sorry for himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then Maviola kicked him. The Drake yelped. He glared at her and then realized. He was doing it again. Here was the problem. Now—where was his solution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…don't know what I should do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola raised her foot. Olesm hurried on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yet.&lt;/em&gt; But—well—hm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He rubbed at his chin in thought. &lt;em&gt;Thought&lt;/em&gt;, for once. And he didn't see Maviola's eyes locked on his face. Her smile, as she saw a fire reigniting in his empty gaze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why don't you show me around? Run your ideas by me. I can listen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She suggested. Olesm looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh! Sure. We can—walk by some of Liscor's attractions. You know, we have great singing performances. Erin's never bothered to go down Stonesong Boulevard, but it really is a sight. They have this Rock Crab—sorry, Hollowstone Deceiver's—shell that they painted and people stand on it and sing. Amazing acoustics. Come on, I'll show you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed and the two began to walk. After a moment, Olesm looked at Maviola, embarrassed. She was smiling, looking around this city with excitement. And at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—well, it's incomplete, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Tell me already.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I had this idea just now. You know my magazine? What if—I saw that Pallass has a newspaper, which is this thing—okay, let me start from the beginning. But hear me out…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He began to talk. And Maviola listened. Smiling and walking with him. She grabbed his arm and listened, laughing. As if she had all the time in the world. Or as if this was all that mattered with the time she had left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the flames grew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Across the Floodplains, a group of seven walked. They were a bit—disconsolate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wow. Erin's a lot more high-strung than I remember. Not as bad as Ryoka, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She really runs this inn? Why? Maybe she likes being…an [Innkeeper]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were debating. Wandering up and down the hills and valleys, marveling at the landscape, the odd rocks scattered here and there, the city in the distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it wasn't—necessarily—a place you wanted to stay. Still, where else did they have to go? Rose was shaking her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin's nice. She let us in &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; we ran up that huge tab."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But how does she have all this? I mean—do you think she actually has a higher level? She's only been here what, a few months?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Leon was skeptical. Kevin scratched his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I dunno, guys. She's a pretty big deal. I was chatting up that Drake. Drassi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hitting on her, you mean. Kevin—that's so disgusting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Galina wrinkled her nose. Kevin looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's like—being one of those people. That dresses up in costumes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A furry?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Troydel looked at her. Kevin frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drassi's not that. She's a person."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But she's a &lt;em&gt;lizard—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't call them that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Guys! I'm just asking if we want to stay &lt;em&gt;here.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose raised her voice. The others looked at her. Joseph, rubbing his head, muttered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why not? We don't have anywhere else to go. But is it safe? Erin can't protect us. She's got that Gnoll—that red-haired girl, a few employees—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That &lt;em&gt;cute&lt;/em&gt; Gnoll. Did you see her face?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Galina sighed. The others were arguing. They were lost. And—under one misconception. Only one, really. They thought of Erin as being like them. Because they didn't know her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Or Liscor. If they had, they might have understood. Crucial facts about the inn, about Erin that made her—not like them. Little details, that was all the seven were missing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like the fact that rocks &lt;em&gt;moved.&lt;/em&gt; One of them slowly stood up and crept over a hill. It had a lot of little legs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another Rock Crab slowly stood up. And then another. And another. They saw the food moving in a helpful group and began to creep closer. Most Gnoll [Hunters] kept their distance from the telltale rocks. But the Earthers, like other animals not used to the Floodplains, didn't know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that wasn't their fault. Rose was poking at the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All I'm saying is, we &lt;em&gt;owe Erin.&lt;/em&gt; Don't be an idiot and steal her drinks, Joseph! We're going to go back, help out, and—just be helpful! Got it? Any objections?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one had any. But it was Imani, a [Survivor], who had been clutching Rose's shirt who quavered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everyone? I just saw—a rock move."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at her. Joseph glanced around. There were a few rocks. Boulders, really. Big. Kevin scratched his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Like…roll down a hill?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. It stood up. That one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Imani pointed. Now the Earthers glanced around. Leon frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Those are a lot of rocks. Were they here…when we started walking?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They halted. Six rocks were spaced around the small hills about them. The Earthers paused. They weren't idiots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think…we should go back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose breathed slowly. She hunted for the magic wand she had been given. Joseph felt at his belt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't have a sword. Anyone else?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…left my wand back at the inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at each other. They glanced back the way they came. There was a giant boulder in the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Imani whimpered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It stood up again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All seven heads turned. They saw a bunch of tiny legs as one of the rocks got up and &lt;em&gt;shuffled&lt;/em&gt; towards them. They stared. Then Imani began to scream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Monsters!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Run!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin bellowed. He pointed. The others ran for a gap—and as one, the Rocks Crab stood up and began scuttling at them. Giant pincers appeared under the rocks as the Rock Crabs lifted up their disguises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they began to click.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclick—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Run! [Fire Arrow]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose pointed. An arrow made of fire blasted off a shell as she missed the gap. She paled at the effort; Imani was screaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Imani, run!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph grabbed her. He and Kevin tried to run with her. But one of the Rock Crabs scuttled in front of them. The group tried to swerve. They nearly tumbled down a valley. The Rock Crabs crept over the ledges, encircling them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh my god. This isn't happening."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Galina looked around. Six Rock Crabs looked down at them. Their antennae-eyes stared at the food. They &lt;em&gt;clicked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Imani was screaming. The others backed up. Rose raised a finger, but her hand was shaking. Kevin looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Make a break for it when they come. Just &lt;em&gt;run. &lt;/em&gt;And maybe some of us will get out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—let's duck under the shells. Maybe they have a weak point."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Leon whispered. Troydel just looked at the Rock Crabs. He grinned, face white.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I guess we find out if this is a game after all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Each to their own. The Rock Crabs paused. Imani's screaming was bothering them. It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; loud. And there was a second sound below it. No—coming from the side? Their antennae turned. And then the screaming grew louder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerks! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get off my lawn!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice raced over a hill. The Earthers looked up. The young woman was alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin! Fucking &lt;em&gt;run!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph bellowed. Erin was unarmed. But she was holding a handful of—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seed cores. Erin threw the first. It &lt;em&gt;splatted&lt;/em&gt; on a Rock Crab's shell. The giant crab recoiled as the deadly poison leaked down towards its antennae. It jerked back and the other Rock Crabs backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get lost!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin threw the other seed cores. The Rock Crabs scurried back as the young Humans looked up, gaping. The [Innkeeper] hurled another core and pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Run! This way!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They looked at each other. Then they ran. Kevin and Joseph went back and grabbed the petrified Imani. Erin threw more seed cores.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah! Get lost! You stupid crabs! I've had it up to here with—uh oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She realized she was out of seed cores. The Rock Crabs stopped scuttling away. They turned. Erin Solstice hesitated. They began scuttling at the poison-thrower, full of rage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do we do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Run!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin pushed Leon towards the inn. She held her ground. Rose pulled at her. Erin shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I said, &lt;em&gt;run for it!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She backed up, covering the other's retreat. You couldn't outrun Rock Crabs on the hills and valleys. They were too fast. Erin raised a fist. She concentrated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aura.&lt;/em&gt; The first Rock Crab coming up the hill saw Erin staring down at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. &lt;em&gt;Hey you.&lt;/em&gt; I'll eat you. Get outta here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] pointed at the Rock Crab. The Hollowstone Deceiver hesitated. The aura was making Erin…feel dangerous. But Erin was tired. Outside her inn. Her aura flickered. The Rock Crab &lt;em&gt;clicked&lt;/em&gt; one claw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh shit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin backed up. She turned to run. The Rock Crab went up the hill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Erin!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose saw the [Innkeeper] leap down the hill. The Rock Crab scurried over the top. It raised a pincer to snap her in half. And an arrow shot from The Wandering Inn's tower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It flashed past Erin and hit the ground. The young woman saw it flashing towards the Rock Crab's feet. A miss?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No—the arrow &lt;em&gt;bounced&lt;/em&gt; off the ground as if it was rubber and went straight under the shell. The Rock Crab made a keening sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Ricochet Arrow]. &lt;/em&gt;From his tower, Bird took aim. He shot another arrow and it &lt;em&gt;curved&lt;/em&gt; and went through the Rock Crab's exposed antennae. Blue blood ran onto the ground as Erin scrambled away. The Rock Crab withdrew into its shell as the other Rock Crabs scuttled past it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is not good. The crabs will eat Miss Solstice. My arrows are not big enough."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bird spoke to himself as he saw Erin running. He casually shot another antennae out, and then looked at the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alarm! Hello? There are Rock Crabs! &lt;em&gt;I am Bird. AND I AM CALLING AN ALARM!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Workers on the roof of the inn looked up. They saw the distant Humans running. They began to &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; their mandibles. Then scream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The piercing wail made the inn's patrons halt. Grimalkin looked up as he demonstrated a proper deadlift. The Horns of Hammerad stopped arguing about how Ceria's aura should be used. Halrac cursed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rock Crabs, all six of them, raced after the Earthers. They were running for the inn. Erin brought up the rear. She hurled her knife through one of the Rock Crab's antennae.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Take that! I'd better get that knife back! Keep running!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They stared at her. She wasn't afraid. She was just—intense. The young woman looked up. And then she grinned. The young people from Earth looked up. And then—they figured out the difference between them and Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wandering Inn &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Metaphorically. Halrac opened a window and shot a glowing arrow out of it. A Rock Crab saw the arrow zoom under its shell and then the arrow detonated. The Rock Crab collapsed as blue blood and smoke ran from underneath the shell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aw, hells! Rock Crabs! I'm slowing them!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria Springwalker pointed. Walls of ice rose behind Erin, blocking another Rock Crab who &lt;em&gt;smashed&lt;/em&gt; into them and failed to break the ice. The other five Rock Crabs saw a blur running at them—then a [Shatterbolt] hit another Rock Crab and the front of its rocky shell shattered. The exposed crab heard a &lt;em&gt;thunk.&lt;/em&gt; It recoiled; two crossbow bolts were embedded in its shell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Switching crossbows."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr announced as Yvlon raced out the door. But she was too slow. Magus Grimalkin leapt, crashed into a third Rock Crab. It swiped at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He punched once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Rock Crabs heard the &lt;em&gt;crunch&lt;/em&gt;. They saw a glowing orb that Typhenous threw hit their exposed comrade. There was a &lt;em&gt;thump&lt;/em&gt;—a flash of light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bits of crab rained down. The remaining three Rock Crabs saw arrows, spells, and little not-snacks running at them. And a horde of very &lt;em&gt;angry&lt;/em&gt; bug-men. They turned and scuttled away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yeah, that's right! Run! &lt;/em&gt;Where's my knife? Aw, I gotta find it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice stood on a hill close to her inn, panting. And the seven Earthers saw the young woman wipe at the sweat and blue blood on her face from where she'd thrown her knife &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; an antennae. They saw her turn to them. And they got it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Holy shit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin breathed. Erin Solstice looked at them, their wide-eyes. The sudden respect or awe or—bewilderment. Imani was crying again. She sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks, Ryoka."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was so easy to be exasperated. Annoyed. Just—furious. At incompetence, incomprehension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Youth. Erin Solstice stood in the inn, staring at Rose and the others. Her patience was &lt;em&gt;done.&lt;/em&gt; Lyonette was letting Erin speak; she and the [Innkeeper] were on the same page. Mrsha was furiously watching from under a table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other adventurers were relaxing after the sudden burst of activity; free drinks and snacks all around. Grimalkin was cleaning blood off his scales as Pryde put in an order for multiple weight sets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You just &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; it was a good idea to walk around? And none of you have swords or even knives?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We—didn't know. Sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose lamely replied. Imani was hiccupping. She was white in the face. Erin inhaled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At the same time, Olesm stopped on Stonesinger Boulevard. He looked at Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think—well, that's my idea. It's not great, but—what do you think?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think it's a good idea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El replied patiently. The old woman, the young woman, looked at Olesm. And saw his face crumple into a mixture of uncertainty from the excitement that had been there just a moment ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—it's just my idea. I mean—Erin didn't help me come up with it. It could backfire. What if I land Liscor in trouble?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was so easy to want to &lt;em&gt;kick&lt;/em&gt; him. Which she'd done a few times. But really kick him, try to beat his uncertainty out of him. But that was youth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she had seen this before. Maviola didn't kick Olesm. She spoke kindly, but directly, sparing no words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is it better than doing &lt;em&gt;nothing?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, but—I'm not Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake confessed. Maviola cocked her head, listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You say her name a lot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Every other sentence. 'Erin did this', or 'Erin showed me that'. Do you think she gave you your class?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] stared over the side of the bridge they were standing on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sometimes, yes. I'm not as original as her. Without her—how much of my accomplishments are mine? The magazine—anything else?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was crumpling, even in his genius. Maviola El looked at him. And she had seen this before. You could be so unkind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—are all—I just don't know what to do. &lt;em&gt;Don't&lt;/em&gt; go outside! Listen, you can't talk about…home. Do you understand? There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; monsters here. Rock Crabs. Shield Spiders—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was berating them. The others listened, flushing. And Imani, gulping, flinched. And then began to scream. Erin jumped as the others crowded around her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Imani! &lt;/em&gt;It's alright!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman was in hysterics. Actual hysterics. She refused to calm down, even though the Rock Crabs were gone. She was crying, hitting the others as they tried to grab her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha stared contemptuously. Her ears hurt. And she hated them. They'd nearly gotten killed by crabs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idiots! &lt;/em&gt;She furiously raced up and kicked Joseph in the leg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ow. What the fuck?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha, stop that!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette snapped. But no one was happy with the Earthers. And Mrsha—looked at Imani as the girl recoiled from her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I want to go &lt;em&gt;home!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She sobbed. Perhaps only Pisces and a few others knew what that meant; Grimalkin was busy talking with Pryde. Imani howled. And Mrsha couldn't take it anymore. She bared her teeth. Ryoka had sent &lt;em&gt;them? &lt;/em&gt;They didn't deserve to be here!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha would take care of them. She'd—she'd make them pay for being so &lt;em&gt;stupid. &lt;/em&gt;Sticks in their pillows. Throw rocks at them! She balled up her little paws into fists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Imani, &lt;em&gt;stop screaming!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph shouted at Imani. But she wouldn't. Erin clenched her teeth. Lyonette looked around, exasperated. She could shut Imani up with her aura. She looked at Rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why is she screaming? They're gone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. It's—she was attacked by Crelers. Her group was—killed. She still has nightmares. Imani, shh. It's okay. Where's the calming tonic, Kevin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We ran out—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette blinked. So did Mrsha. She stopped, ready to slash an ankle with her thorn paw. And she looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Crelers? Oh. Her entire group was—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin mouthed the word 'eaten' at Lyonette. The [Princess] paled. And the Horns of Hammerad slowly looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Imani was still terrified. Crying. In hysterics, yes. Which grated on the ears. It was so easy to hate that. Unless you had seen it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lived it. Mrsha looked at Imani's tears. And it had not been Crelers for her, but Goblins. Yet she knew what it was like to be afraid, even in a safe place. She thought how exasperated she, Erin, Lyonette—everyone was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the Gnoll child realized they were being unkind. She looked up at the frightened girl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was crying. Weeping, babbling about Crelers, as she clung to Kevin. This world's nightmares. She had survived &lt;em&gt;that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin's arms slowly uncrossed. She looked at Imani, and the other silent young people from Earth. And she saw it in every line of how they stood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fear. Uncertainty. Terror, still. They hadn't known about the Rock Crabs. Hadn't imagined they could have been in that much danger five minutes from the inn. Erin Solstice looked at them and remembered a young woman who had run screaming from a Rock Crab the first time she'd gone for a walk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then she saw a little white Gnoll looking up at her. And Erin Solstice felt her anger—fading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The little eyes were judging her. Erin was ashamed, because Mrsha looked disappointed. In herself, and the [Innkeeper]. In Erin, who welcomed Goblins. And wouldn't welcome some people from her world because they weren't what she &lt;em&gt;wanted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Imani."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The hysterics were fading—at least from screams into sobs. Typhenous cleared his throat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps a [Calm] spell?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Please."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old mage walked over. He reached out and Imani flinched. But Typhenous smiled kindly at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This won't hurt a bit, Miss Imani."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He touched her head, whispered a word. And Imani relaxed. She still clung to the others. But the worst of her fear—vanished. And Erin Solstice took a breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. I should have warned you all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what she said first. She looked at the seven young people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's just—this was so sudden. I wasn't sure how to—greet you. But I meant what I said."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gestured around the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have room. Stay as long as you want. But you do have to know things. About Rock Crabs. And—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes darted to Palt, who was muttering about [Calm] spells versus &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;superior [Remove Fear] spells. Montressa, and Beza, watching them like hawks. Erin looked at the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—there are complications. It's not always easy. But listen. If you want to stay here, you're welcome."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at each other. And the [Princess] walked forwards. She smiled and nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right. I don't know if I've done this formally—I'm Lyonette. And this is Mrsha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gestured at the little white Gnoll. And the [Princess] saw something familiar in the young people from Earth too. Like a [Princess] who refused to even take orders. Exasperating, yes. Infuriating? Beyond so. But they were not all the &lt;em&gt;same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Imani jumped. And then she looked down. A little Gnoll looked up at her apologetically. Not all the same. She nuzzled Imani's leg. And swatted at Rose's hand as the young woman tried to pat her on the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Youth was failure. Maviola looked at Olesm as he stood on the bridge, afraid to make a mistake again. And she saw his flame guttering. To her—the world was fire. It was her passion, her class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Olesm Swifttail. You &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a fool."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at her. And the flames ran lower. But Maviola just drew herself up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"By that, I mean, you think everything you have came from this Erin Solstice. And that's why you're a fool. Because just a moment ago you had a brilliant idea! What &lt;em&gt;fire!&lt;/em&gt; What creativity! Yes, it came from other people. Yes, you use their ideas. But so &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt; No one is entirely original. You just need the daring, the will to try and fail."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Try your idea. Show me your determination."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But what if I can't?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm looked at her. Flinching. Maviola shook her head and her hair blazed. She burned in the daylight, and her triumph shone even under the sun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Listen. I've failed and triumphed more times than I can count, in equal quantity! And the failure &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; hurts. But we do not grow, we do not level from never having tried. You have to try. Or you will be the same forever. And—you do not have to do it alone. Few people ever stand alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached for his clawed hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And a little Gnoll's paw found Imani's hand. The young woman started. The [Survivor] looked into another [Survivor]'s eyes. And Mrsha tugged Imani, pointing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;To a magical door. The group of seven started, gasping. Rose looked wide-eyed towards the grass hill. Imani hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is…&lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She drew back. But Mrsha tugged at her, smiling. Erin looked at her garden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That? That's the [Garden of Sanctuary]. Go on. It's safe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Imani hesitated. She looked down at Mrsha, and felt a kindred spirit. And Lyonette watched. Numbtongue stood with Bird, observing the way the seven children looked at that magical place. Looking at Imani.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hadn't ever been safe. Felt safe. She had come into this world and it had been purely unfair to her. Without reason, or logic. Bad things had happened, and there was no excuse for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They knew that full well. The [Princess], the [Druid], the [Bard], the [Innkeeper], and the [Hunter]. That was one of the things that unified them. Casual cruelty by mocking fate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But look.&lt;/em&gt; The Gnoll girl led the young woman into the garden. A safe, magical place. The little champion led a frightened stranger into a beautiful place. Up a hill. And Imani's voice caught as she found the hilltop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was empty, for her. But she sat there and felt—safe. She closed her eyes as the big Gnoll girl sat next to her and offered a little yellow flower that shone with gold. And she breathed easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For here was safety. You felt it in the air. Rose gasped as she saw the Sage's Grass. Kevin blinked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. What is this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A safe place. The safest place I know of."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin answered for him. A [Druid] had been granted entrance to this place despite her Skill, but that was probably his class. But Grimalkin had not, with all his power. So she had to believe it was secure. If you tried to enter with malicious intent, you would have to break this inn first. Erin Solstice had made this garden. And it was &lt;em&gt;safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked from face to face. And then she said it, complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm Erin Solstice. This is my inn. This is my place. And you're welcome to stay here a while."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette smiled. And her eyes lit up. She saw Mrsha, her darling daughter, sitting with Imani on the hilltop. And Lyonette felt something rising in her. A certainty. She walked up the hill, and her new Skill burned in her chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Something to inspire. Maviola looked at Olesm. That was what he needed. And she told him that. Fire was honest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No one ever gave you your fire. It was always &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; you. They just lit the spark. You let it go out. But it's still there. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake wanted to believe. But he too was no fool. He ducked his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You say that. But I can't just—change. I needed Erin. Maybe she didn't make me. But I needed her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. You're like—charcoal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks? In that I'm single-use?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! &lt;em&gt;Listen, &lt;/em&gt;you idiot. You're capable of doing so much. But sometimes you need a push. Sometimes someone is good in a group instead of alone. And that's fine. You just need a spark."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grabbed him, and turned, laughing. The air shone with dancing magical sparks. Like fireflies. Olesm looked around. Maviola was—igniting. Her black hair began to turn to flame. His eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you? Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] smiled. She drew closer. On the hilltop, Lyonette scooped up Mrsha. Erin smiled, tired, but—willing to try as she saw the young people so like her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't perfect. It was flawed. But today, at least—Erin smiled. If she was petty enough to turn away a stranger at the door, she wouldn't have made it this far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm so proud of you. My little hero."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette du Marquin whispered to the Gnoll. And Maviola drew Olesm closer as the flames engulfed her. But they burned no flesh or scale. Only spirit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They call me &lt;em&gt;Maviola.&lt;/em&gt; Lady Firestarter. Look at me, you beautiful ember. Show me how you burn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bent forwards. And kissed the Drake. She whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[A Little Bit of Courage].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes widened. And the spark &lt;em&gt;lit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette kissed Mrsha's forehead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Boon of the Princess]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll's eyes went round. Lyonette saw something appear. A glowing—sigil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It looked like a little halo. A hovering blessing you had to look for to see. The heraldry of The Eternal Throne of Calanfer. Lyonette &lt;em&gt;gasped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The little [Druid] stood taller. And she heard a sound in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 215, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Temporary Skill – Barkfur obtained!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 215, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Temporary Skill – Lesser Strength obtained!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes opened &lt;em&gt;wide.&lt;/em&gt; Lyonette heard the Skills too. She tumbled backwards. Mrsha looked at herself. She raced about. Then—she looked at Lyonette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whoa, what's this place? It's amazing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin and the others were coming up the hill. Mrsha felt the power racing through her. A blessing. She sat back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then she howled. The sound was joyous, and Ishkr, the other Gnolls looked up. Marveling. Mrsha raced forwards, blazing with life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She charged, howling like a beast from legends. Mrsha the Great and Terrible cannonballed into Kevin's stomach. He went &lt;em&gt;whoof &lt;/em&gt;and tumbled down the hill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Help! Get her off! Get her off—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My blessing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette saw Mrsha &lt;em&gt;dragging&lt;/em&gt; Kevin by the foot. And she looked around. And laughed and laughed. And the invincible daughter knocked Erin flat with a flying head-butt. She arm-wrestled Rose and lost—barely. Mrsha crashed around the tables, a cannonball unafraid of the impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Blessed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The little Gnoll raced about, blazing with a mother's love, a royal gift. And she was one of two fires igniting in Liscor. If you thought about things like fire, that was. You could probably get tired of the metaphor. But banana-based metaphors were more difficult.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Skill—the [Boon of the Princess] was a &lt;em&gt;Skill&lt;/em&gt; among Skills. Lyonette knew about royal blessings. But this was hers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it didn't run out. Mrsha went from becoming a terror in the common room to actually &lt;em&gt;lifting&lt;/em&gt; weights in the weights-room. She made Numbtongue hit her—which he did very gently—and her two temporary Skills didn't halt, even six hours later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a &lt;em&gt;boon.&lt;/em&gt; I can only give it to one person at a time. And I can't switch it like that. But it's still my boon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] smiled, laughing. She stood in the inn, working, as the Horns and Halfseekers and Griffon Hunt left, cleaning up, as Erin gave the others a crash course on rules of the inn—watching as Grimalkin's eyes bulged over Pryde's funding. But she could have predicted that. House Ulta was not poor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then—the door opened. Erin Solstice looked up from a game of chess against Joseph. And her eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Olesm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake paused in the common room. He looked about. And inhaled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello, Erin. I'm not—bothering you, am I?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—come in. I was just—sorry, I'm a bit busy. But—Joseph, can you hold on? Bird can play you. We didn't get to speak, yesterday, Olesm—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake held up a claw. And someone else entered the inn. Lyonette blinked at the familiar [Lady]. And she felt a kinship. She stared at Maviola's orange in her black hair, and Maviola noted Lyonette's red hair. They looked at each other as Olesm looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't want to bother you, Erin. Actually—I was hoping I could talk to Drassi. Can I borrow her?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drassi? Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin blinked. But Olesm smiled and walked past her. Confidently. Pursuing his goals. As he walked past Erin to the intrigued Drassi, Lyonette stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] was looking at her. She looked a bit older than Lyonette. And felt—so different. Lyonette tilted her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—we've met, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman sketched a curtsey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello. I'm Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lyon. Lyonette."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] caught herself the first time, and then gave her full name. There was no use hiding. They looked at each other. Lyonette noticed Maviola's worn clothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—lost your money pouch, right? Ceria wanted to leave some coin for you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Thank you. I'll pay her back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola accepted the small pouch of coins. She looked at Lyonette. And the two exchanged an unspoken thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They looked at each other. And gave each other small smiles. Exchanged a nod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can I get you something to eat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I haven't had lunch. Thank you. What's—a 'lasagna'?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette brought her some. Maviola sat down as Olesm spoke to Drassi. The female Drake's tail began wagging with excitement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way! I can do that! Just give me one second! Where's the newspaper? Yeah—and if we get a [Scribe]—sure!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I talked with Beilmark already. Do you know if I can talk to…Bird?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure. He's upstairs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm went up the steps. Maviola watched him out of the corner of her eyes as she was served. She gasped at the lovely square of food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh! I've had this in Terandria. It just wasn't called that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes—do you want a drink?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—some blue fruit juice. Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] smiled. And then Erin noticed her. The [Innkeeper] had been glancing up, sensing something familiar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Hey. Don't I know you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maviola. I was here yesterday. Thank you for having me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin nodded, vaguely. She opened her mouth, but Joseph was blinking at Apista.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola turned back to her food, smiling as Erin was distracted. They'd speak again. She reached for her fork—and saw a bold little paw reaching for some of her complimentary fries. Maviola frowned and ducked her head under the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha froze, in the midst of her theft. Maviola's eyes lit up as the little Gnoll stared boldly at her. The [Lady] laughed. And then fixed a piercing gaze on Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What a beautiful little child. Steal from my plate and face the consequences."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bared her teeth. Mrsha stared back at Maviola's &lt;em&gt;look.&lt;/em&gt; Which was young in feature, but in expression—reminded her of the really old granny-Gnolls. Mrsha slowly backed away from her plate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm so sorry. Did Mrsha bother you? Mrsha! No desserts!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette hurried back with the drink. Mrsha fled. The [Princess] hesitated. Then she sat down opposite Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you—staying in Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just for a bit. To get away from things. And you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I live here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El glanced up. She looked at Lyonette. The [Princess] saw Maviola laugh, and her eyes lit up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It seems fun!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It really is. Hard at times, but—I do like it. Are you…? What brought you here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Firestarter sipped from her drink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One last adventure. But I've done this kind of thing more than once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola winked at the [Princess]. Lyonette glanced around. She frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shoot. &lt;em&gt;Mrsha!&lt;/em&gt; Enough! I'm sorry, I have to—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha the Invincible was trying to pick a fight with Kevin's knees. Lyonette sighed; she had to work since Drassi was suddenly very busy with a quill and paper. She looked at Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's…talk. When we have the time. I'm busy today, but I have days off."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That would be nice. I'm actually following that blue Drake around today. Olesm Swifttail. Do you know him?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. He's actually—a friend of the inn. Sort of. But—he hasn't been around a lot. It's complicated."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette gestured awkwardly. Maviola leaned forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. Can I get another lasagna for him? He'll want to speak to you as well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me? What for?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'll see."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola sat back. When Olesm came down, bursting with excitement, Lyonette sat down at the table. She blinked. But then agreed to his idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Olesm scarfed down his food. Maviola leapt up. And then raced off to find a [Scribe]. By the time they came back to the inn, all three pieces were done. Olesm was scribbling on a piece of parchment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay—so—do we put Lyonette's piece first?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Drassi's. Put that Bird piece at the back. And you misspelled 'serendipidously'. It's serendipitously."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan and Ratici &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt; as the two sat at a table. Olesm rearranged the pieces of parchment and paper. He shuffled them, and then showed them to Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How's this for a rough draft?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She read through it. The little bit of courage was still in him. But it was just a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt;. It couldn't turn a [Farmer] into a [General]. But it could give you a little push. And in that sense, it was a powerful Skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She read as Olesm fidgeted. Maviola put down the documents. Then she threw her head back and laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She laughed and laughed, but merrily. And told him to send it to the [Scribe]. Then Olesm took a deep breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay, we might have the prototypes by the time the Council meets. Now—I need to figure out what to say. I'm afraid that's just a bunch of math."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let me help. I'm good at balancing budgets."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? You can calculate?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El gave Olesm a mock-glare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Try me. Just don't ask me to turn a profit. Come on. Where's your office?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She dragged him out of the chair. Olesm's jaw dropped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But Erin hates calculations."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So? What does that have to do with &lt;em&gt;me?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That evening, Strategist Olesm Swifttail stood in front of Liscor Council's meeting room. And he was not alone. Maviola saw him adjusting the prototype in his hands. Incomplete; you couldn't work wonders in a single day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was enough. Olesm consulted his notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I might be fired after this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you are, that's too bad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] looked askance. He hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You wouldn't happen to have anything really encouraging to say to me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El thought about it. She shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is your &lt;em&gt;job.&lt;/em&gt; Go in there and do it proudly. And remember: you're doing what you think is &lt;em&gt;right.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She put a hand on his shoulder. The Drake took a deep breath. And then he opened the doors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Excuse me,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Councilmembers.&lt;/em&gt; A word before our conference with the Walled Cities and High Command?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council looked up. Hexel was long gone, to redesign the city with all the notes. They were debating the upcoming meeting hotly. None of them looked happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah—Olesm. This really isn't a good time. By all means, make your notes when we have the meeting. But we're just consulting with Watch Captain Zevara—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism cleared his throat. Zevara was standing in front of the Council, looking unhappy. They were going to be chewed out for a second day in a row. The other Walled Cities would spend most of it going over what everyone had learned from Magnolia and asking what &lt;em&gt;Liscor&lt;/em&gt; would do about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then—they'd ask Chaldion and the army's High Command for a decision on what should be done. Olesm knew this because it was what had happened yesterday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it was wrong. He spoke, politely looking his uncle in the eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Councilmember Lism. I'm aware of the pressing time. Which is why, as [Strategist] of Liscor, I demand your time. I'll review Architect Hexel's work as well later and present my opinions to the Council. For now—if I can direct your attention to this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He passed around the copied bundles of parchment. Not papyrus or paper; these were rough-copies the [Scribe] had made. The Council blinked as Olesm briskly went back to the front of the desk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I plan on addressing the Walled Cities first. I'm sure the Council will allow this? Also—this is unrelated, but I'd like the city to fund this new project."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is this, Olesm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia blinked at the object in front of her. It was…a bundle of words. A colorful image of Liscor and the Floodplains over a title. She read, slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Liscorian Gazette.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Featuring chess commentary, news by Drassi Tewing, perspectives of each species, and stories of your city. Edited by Olesm Swifttail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A newspaper. Like the one Pallass has."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jeiss was the first one to catch on. He grinned, flipping through it. Olesm nodded politely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Exactly. I was thinking about the issue of relations between species in the city—and of course, our own changing times. Through this, the Council can speak to the people. I'll include a little chess section—and other extras. This is just the prototype."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Councilmembers looked at each other. And Lism burst into a huge smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magnificent! Well, this is a welcome surprise, Olesm. I knew my neph—er, our [Strategist] would come up with something. So—we'll send this out to other cities along with your chess magazine!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm gave Lism a blank look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Councilmember Lism."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Shopkeeper] turned [Councilmember] paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm folded his claws behind his back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why would we do so, Councilmember? It's Liscor's news. I plan to continue my chess magazine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But this is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; news."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alonna tapped the newspaper, proudly, though it hadn't existed an hour ago. Elirr snorted into his paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; our news, I think is what Olesm is trying to say. Pallass has their newspaper too. Why would other cities want to read ours?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council looked disappointed. Raekea frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait—then, this is copying, no? Is this allowed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked worried; [Blacksmiths] had their own relationship with stealing designs. Maviola, her ear pressed against the door, grinned. Olesm was ready for this. He bowed to the Gnoll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Certainly, it is, Councilwoman Raekea. But so are most things in life. And while this might only affect our city—I think this newspaper is necessary. If you'll read the article headlines?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured as the Council began to actually read The Liscorian Gazette. Olesm went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The newspaper has more of a role than just—announcements. This is a balanced perspective of each species. Miss Lyonette wrote the first article, about being a Human in Liscor. For many people, that might be their insight in what it means to be a Human. Senior Guardswoman Beilmark spoke to Drassi about the challenges she faced entering the Watch, and the differences between Gnolls and Drakes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I &lt;em&gt;see.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia's eyes sharpened. She looked up at Olesm. A Human perspective? Olesm nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who knows what it's really like, being another species? There is also a short article by an Antinium."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism recoiled from the paper. He looked at Olesm in shock. So did the entire Council, Zevara included.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Antinium, Olesm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara frowned. The Drake just nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tensions between the Antinium and other species in Liscor are at an all-time high. I hope—this will calm those conflicts."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But the Antinium are &lt;em&gt;doubling&lt;/em&gt; their numbers beneath our city—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism spluttered, looking at Olesm in clear confusion. His views were known. Olesm sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Councilmember Lism. My perspective is that the Antinium &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a threat. As I will say to the Walled Cities in—thirteen minutes, I believe. But our struggle is for the security of Liscor, not promoting clashes on the streets. To that end—I asked one of the Antinium to write a piece to…individualize them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who? Which one?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council looked at each other. Zevara slowly flipped towards the back of the magazine. She read. And despite herself—she chuckled. The others stared at her as Zevara's stony expression broke for just a moment. Then they read the article too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birds I Eat, by Bird of the The Wandering Inn. &lt;/em&gt;It was a catalogue of birds that Bird had seen. There were even images.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's incomplete. More illustrations to be added. I hired an [Illustrator] with a passion for nature to draw them. Bird was very happy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm pointed at the article. There were ratings of each bird, out of five stars, and how delicious they were, how hard to hunt, how beautiful—Bird had obsessive rankings. Despite themselves, the Council chuckled. Even Lism snorted. He looked up at Olesm. And his smile was fond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Brilliant. Well, I can see our way clear to approving this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But where do we find the funding—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tismel ducked as Lism &lt;em&gt;threw&lt;/em&gt; a cup at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; expensive! Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned to Olesm. The Drake took a deep breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think the city will find room in the budget for it. It may even pay for itself depending on its popularity. Incidentally—how well can we fund Architect Hexel's plans?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council fell silent. Morosely, they looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…We'll have to request funding from the Walled Cities. In addition to the money agreed upon. It's one of the topics we'll be raising. Along with security."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara grimaced. Olesm nodded. He took a seat as the Council glumly prepared for the communication spell. And Maviola's heart beat faster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was it. A bit of courage. She listened as the Walled Cities and even Liscor's own High Command were magically connected with the Council. Maviola sat with one ear to the door, chasing off the people who gave her odd looks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she heard a lot of debate. As Olesm had told her, this was Drake chaos. Which sounded a lot like Human nobility infighting with some subtle differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Walled Cities were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; happy. And they were taking turns to berate each other and Liscor. Speculating—it was at first just a noise contest, until the confident voices won through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's clear Liscor was unaware of these issues. I have &lt;em&gt;no time&lt;/em&gt; for assigning blame among the Walled Cities. The Antinium's numbers must be addressed. If the Free Hive is this large, we may be woefully in error with our projections of the other Hives' numbers, even with our estimates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Chaldion snapped through Pallass' screen. They'd copied Wistram's system so each representative and the congregated members of each command were squeezed into the scrying orb's perspective. The viewpoint changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Salazsar agrees. We motion for increased security against the Antinium. This is a budgetary meeting, not a shouting match. Zeres."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ilvriss' cool voice broke into the conversation. There was a spluttering sound from Zeres' feed. But a representative of Pallass—one of the [Senators] spoke off, interrupting Chaldion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The issue of budget is a concern. But why are &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; funding Liscor? Far better, one imagines, to enact our own projects. Liscor has already demanded money for construction—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you saying we shouldn't address the issue of the Antinium threat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of Oteslia's [Strategists] snapped. The [Senator], Errif, smiled without really smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all. But this is clearly a Liscorian concern. An individual city takes on their own issues. If the gold is not going to be used adequately…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't try to weasel out of this. Liscor is closest to Pallass!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A representative to Manus barked. Errif sneered back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're fully prepared to give an &lt;em&gt;appropriate&lt;/em&gt; budget to Liscor, Manus. We can afford it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You little snake—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Walled Cities began to bicker. And a sharp voice cut through all the arguments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Liscor's High Command. We want to know what actions will be taken around the Free Antinium. We support the demand to cut their numbers until the Hive falls in line with the original treaties. Only then will funding be released to Liscor from our forces."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone fell silent. Olesm saw the Council look up. He knew that voice. One of Liscor's [Generals]. High Command.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So far from home. They had left because of Liscor's Hive. In many ways—that had caused a schism between the army and the city. But the army had more money than the city. The view switched back to a [Mage Strategist] from Fissival. He nodded warily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fissival supports this measure. The Antinium &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be curtailed. What pressure will Liscor's council put on them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Zeres agrees. Punitive measures. Liscor? Your submission?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council stirred. Lism looked at Krshia, swearing silently. Jeiss was shaking his head. Demand the Antinium Hive &lt;em&gt;halve&lt;/em&gt; their numbers? But the Walled Cities were all murmuring agreement. Some of their representatives, like Chaldion, Manus's security council, and Ilvriss were expressing dissent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it fell on Liscor to respond. Krshia was slowly rising, looking at Lism. He jabbed a claw at his chest and the two whispered to each other as the others shifted, impatiently. And before they could come to an agreement—Olesm stood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was shaking. But his voice was clear. His tail was jittering so much Jeiss and Alonna looked alarmed. But Olesm walked forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Councilmembers, as [Strategist] of Liscor I believe it is time for me to express my opinion."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism looked at his nephew and shook his head. But it was too late. Dragonspeaker Luciva spoke and every voice went silent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Manus agrees. Approach and state Liscor's measures, Strategist Olesm Swifttail of Liscor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] nearly threw up then and there. He did in his mouth, a bit. Some of the most powerful Gnolls and Drakes in the world were looking at him. The view switched to Ilvriss; the Wall Lord smiled slightly, then Chaldion was looking at Olesm with his good eye, impatiently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was it. Maviola closed her eyes. She had seen the fire, the potential. Now, the Drake proved her right or wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm opened his mouth and belched. It came out, nervously, a hiccup. The watchers all recoiled. The Drake frantically waved at his face. He spoke before someone demanded him thrown out a window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Apologies. As I was about to say. High Command of Liscor's army. Representatives of the Walled Cities. In regards to Liscor's actions against the Antinium…it is my recommendation as [Strategist] of Liscor…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked into the scrying orb. At every eye on him. And his mouth dried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Sharkcaptain of Zeres growled. Olesm took another breath. He could run away now. And if he ran—Maviola had shown him, he'd keep running. Better to be fired. Olesm closed his eyes as he replied. But he did reply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Apologies, Zeres. I misspoke. I should have said—as [Strategist] of Liscor. It is my &lt;em&gt;decision&lt;/em&gt; that in light of Liscor's insufficient safeguards against the Antinium, their breach of the treaty was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enough to constitute hostile action. As such—I will, with my authority, &lt;em&gt;veto&lt;/em&gt; any such motions that affect the relationship between my city and the Free Hive of the Antinium."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a second there was silence. Then another second. Olesm's heart thundered. He cracked one eye open. Then he heard Lism &lt;em&gt;drop&lt;/em&gt; something with a clatter. Maviola laughed silently out the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bellow came from the Sharkcaptain—and then High Command. The room burst into a flurry of voices, all demanding—Olesm shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me.&lt;em&gt; Excuse me!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone shut that idiot up! Zeres—kick that insane Drake out of—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pallass. &lt;em&gt;Silence. &lt;/em&gt;Let the [Strategist] speak."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Manus agrees."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Salazsar acknowledges Strategist Olesm. Speak."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three voices cut through the clamor. Three of the six Walled Cities spoke. Someone on Zeres' side was shouting obscenities—then a cool voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Gardener of Oteslia acknowledges. A majority calls upon Liscor's [Strategist] to speak. Why no action, Strategist Olesm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gardener of Oteslia.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; the Dragonspeaker of Manus. Olesm's mouth was dry. But he'd come this far, and there was a comfort in letting it all go. He shuffled his notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To answer your questions, honored guests—I first ask that you consult the documents sent to you via [Message] spell—twenty minutes ago."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He listened to the confused babble for a moment, went on as the others demanded the very documents. Ilvriss was reading his. And smiling. Olesm looked into the scrying orb and spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe that the Antinium presence in Liscor is, while in breach of our initial treaties—&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; solvable by direct pressure on the Hive. They will most certainly resist. This would lead to a confrontation between the Free Hive and Liscor. One which will result in warfare."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And are you implying Liscor would lose that confrontation? Or that we should fear Antinium aggression?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [General] of Liscor spoke. Olesm stared at the three [Generals] of Liscor, and the Drake with a burn mark around his face. And he bowed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Respectfully, General Sendel? &lt;em&gt;In either event, &lt;/em&gt;Liscor loses. The Free Antinium are our allies. Liscor has no desire to engage in what will certainly be a destructive war. Nor—at this moment—does Liscor intend to begin the Third Antinium War. Which is what confrontation with the Free Antinium means."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He listened to the frozen murmur. &lt;em&gt;Does High Command want that?&lt;/em&gt; General Sendel was silent. Olesm went on, into his one moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Respected guests. I understand today's meeting is about funding for Liscor's security. I understand the reluctance of the other Walled Cities to support Liscor. However—with respect— I submit that the Antinium were allowed to grow and take actions that violated the letter and law of our agreement because Liscor was &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;underfunded.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another murmur. Olesm held up a claw, forestalling Errif and a dozen voices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It seems to me, High Command, respected members of the Walled Cities—that Liscor's defenses were always insufficient, beginning from when Liscor agreed to harbor the Antinium. Please recall—the decision to harbor the Free Antinium was meant to &lt;em&gt;end &lt;/em&gt;the Second Antinium War. And Liscor agreed to it. However, we were granted almost no funds to prepare for the Hive at that time. And subsequently—our army left."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at the High Command of Liscor's army.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our army has returned once since then. In times past, Liscor's army did move abroad and take on mercenary contracts. But they always protected their home. Not so in recent decades. It seems to me, as [Strategist] of &lt;em&gt;Liscor&lt;/em&gt; that our lack of funding, the absence of our army…was intentional. Perhaps Liscor was always meant to fail, but do so in an advantageous way to the Walled Cities. If that is the case—the Free Antinium's actions cannot be faulted."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dead silence now. Ilvriss' eyes glittered. So did Manus' security council. Chaldion's good eye never blinked. But no one said a word. Because the ones in the know—knew Olesm was right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola smiled. There was nothing unique about Olesm's conclusion. No grand brilliance in his speech, for all he had practiced it on her to make it eloquent. He had just said it out loud. And that took more than a bit of courage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is a bold accusation, Strategist Olesm. What do the Walled Cities gain from losing a city to the Antinium?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice; Maviola couldn't tell which one. Olesm replied steadily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is no accusation, High Strategist. Just practicality. I submit that if Liscor fell to the Antinium, it would indeed make sense—strategically. Since they would be poised to threaten the north and thus necessitate Human intervention, for fear of incursions at least. A conflict with Liscor would also weaken at least one of the Hives and if a decisive strike were carried out preemptively…there is much to be said for allowing Liscor to fall. If war is the goal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He took a breath. The Walled Cities were silent, waiting. Their connection was secure, unable to be listened to even by Wistram. Magically secure—but for an ear against the door. Olesm spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As [Strategist] of Liscor, honored guests, I have only one demand. Clarity. If Liscor is meant to stand alone, let us &lt;em&gt;stand alone.&lt;/em&gt; Otherwise, if we are Drakes, the same city that General Sserys called home, that the Tidebreaker fought for—I demand the aid of the other Walled Cities. Because either way, this is our land. And we will not leave it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raised the second document he'd brought into the room, the ones now in front of Ilvriss, Chaldion, and all the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have submitted a budget plan for the renovation and reinforcement of Liscor as a city. I hope each Walled City and the army will see fit to contribute to it. All of it—or nothing. The Free Antinium have been allowed to expand because Liscor &lt;em&gt;was not funded.&lt;/em&gt; If the Walled Cities and High Command believe this to be acceptable in the future in preparation for Liscor as a sacrifice—give us nothing. Otherwise, this is my requirement."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He tapped the report. It was neatly broken down with Maviola and Olesm's rough estimates, giving some reason for the number underlined at the bottom. But it was really just a number. The other cities paged through the report. After a moment, the Sharkcaptain of Zeres coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Is there an extra zero here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Walled Cities murmured. Ilvriss smiled, and leaned forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe it is time for debate. Liscor, we will remove you from this—discussion. Please hold."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sound was muted. The scrying orb flickered from arguing people in silence. Someone threw a chair in one of the scrying orbs. He looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods, Olesm…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara stared at him. He nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It won't fund all your improvements, Watch Captain. I asked only for as much as I thought we needed—Liscor may still need to source more money. But it should fund the construction for Architect Hexel."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What if they offer us less?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will refuse it. I meant what I said."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tismel choked on his tongue in a corner. Olesm's eyes flicked to the orb. The arguing people on the other side—paused for a second. Maviola's eyes glittered. &lt;em&gt;Smart, Olesm.&lt;/em&gt; Just because one side couldn't hear the other, did not mean the reverse was true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a long eternity, a short wait, until sound resumed. It was a representative from Salazsar who spoke for the others. Wall Lady Calistoca spoke, glaring down at Olesm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strategist Olesm. The Walled Cities do not take…&lt;em&gt;sides&lt;/em&gt; in the disputes of lesser—er—other Drake cities. We do fund certain projects at times. But we do not interfere in a city's business. Drake settlements are sovereign unto themselves. And that is how we prefer it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm bowed his head. The old Wall Lady pursed her lips and then spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"However. We agree the Free Antinium must be curtailed in light of their…advancements. Is your decision to veto any actions against the Free Antinium final?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Wall Lady."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake felt a pang. There was a…rhythm to her words. The Wall Lady's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One moment, Wall Lady. Excuse me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism strode forwards. The Wall Lady cut off, looking affronted. Lism put an arm around Olesm's shoulders. And the [Shopkeeper] politely sneered into the scrying orb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I just felt Liscor's &lt;em&gt;Council&lt;/em&gt; should present our opinions. We will also back a veto to go after the Free Antinium. They are—&lt;em&gt;Liscor's&lt;/em&gt; assets, after all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It looked like he threw up in his mouth to say that. But he stood with his nephew. Olesm looked up at Lism—then saw Krshia standing next to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The entire Council's decision."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And my backing as Watch Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara stepped forwards. Calistoca's eyes bulged. But now Liscor's entire leadership stood in front of the scrying orb. The High Command of the army looked like they were having heart attacks in the background.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Go ahead and fire him now, you scaly lizard—er—idiot.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism muttered under his breath. He…might have been audible to everyone on the call. Silently, the image flickered. Wall Lord Ilvriss pushed forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think that settles it. Unless we'd like to…? No? Very well. Liscor—we will grant you your proposed budget, in exchange for certain assurances of completion. We may send our representatives to monitor the work. Is that acceptable?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Wall Lord."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm's knees shook. Lism kept him upright. Ilvriss smiled into the scrying orb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Very well then. Let's discuss implementation. Now, for funding—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The argument began anew. But Maviola didn't hear. She'd run off, throwing her arms up, laughing until she got behind a closed door and then she screamed triumphantly. She laughed, relieved and delighted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fire burned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;—-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm Swifttail emerged from the Council's chambers amid cheering. The Council was celebrating, even Tismel. He was flushed—Lism had stood three rounds with his nephew and it looked like they were going to continue partying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he was looking for someone. Maviola El wasn't outside the Council's room; probably wise since they'd been demanding Street Runners bring them libations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was in his office, where they'd planned the audacity. He paused in the door as she napped in the fading light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was still glowing. Or perhaps he was. He felt alive. Triumphant. He paused, as she opened her eyes and woke up from her nap in his chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You did it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She beamed at him. Olesm hesitated—then went into the office and sat in the guest's chair in the little, cramped space. He looked around. He'd asked for and doubled his salary. He could have probably quadrupled it, but he really didn't need it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I did. But it wasn't really me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at him. The Drake rested his elbows on his knees, letting his claws droop downwards as he clasped them loosely. He looked at Maviola, wondering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You did it too. I realized it—you made it possible. If not for you, I'd be wallowing in misery this morning. Probably just standing there, letting them give us nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded back towards the raucous celebrations. Lism was hugging and kissing everyone—he reached Krshia and caught himself, spat out hairs. Glared at her. She hugged him and raised a cup, roaring with laughter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola's eyes twinkled as she looked at Olesm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're doing it again. Take some credit for your bravery. I didn't do more than give you a nudge. And you were amazing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She sat up, came around the desk. Olesm was shaking his head. He drew back as she tried to sit on the same chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—Maviola. Listen. Thank you so much. But—I'm afraid it's—you're like Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin Solstice. Yes, your muse, your inspiration. But I'm not &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; And she didn't make you. We established that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola laughed. Olesm drew back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—she helped. Maybe I don't need to stand alone. But she—and you—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's wrong with needing help?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She sat on his lap, facing him. The flimsy chair &lt;em&gt;creaked&lt;/em&gt; alarmingly with both their weights, light as they were. Olesm tried to lift her off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Maviola—listen. You're &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much like Erin. I shouldn't. We shouldn't. It would just be like how I feel—felt for Erin—you're too much like her. I shouldn't."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] regarded Olesm. In the sunset, she threw back her head and rose. Her eyes flashed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see. I'm just like Erin, am I?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…can't unsee the connection."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm whispered. He saw Maviola turn. He sighed, bowing his head. Then Maviola, who blazed with fire—did something that was Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She lifted a foot, and then &lt;em&gt;stomped&lt;/em&gt; on the gap between Olesm's legs. She missed him—barely. But the rickety chair collapsed. Olesm crashed to the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola straddled his body. She looked down at him, eyes gleaming. And she leaned forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There's &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; exactly like me, you fool. Or did you ever burn for her like this? Did she for you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake [Strategist] gaped up at her. That was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an Erin move. He stared up at Maviola. Erin burned like Maviola, sometimes. But she was happiness. She loved the Antinium. But Maviola—agreed they were dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was passionate. Maviola prickly. Erin was—Maviola was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The superimposed image of Erin over Maviola's face disappeared. Because she was industriously checking his belt. She looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well? Are we similar?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. She's wasn't ever like this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He whispered. The [Lady] leaned over Olesm and reached behind her back. She laughed, young, vibrant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then let's find out how different I &lt;em&gt;am.&lt;/em&gt; Unless you don't want to?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And of course, they both knew the answer to that. The blue-scaled Drake looked up. And then he nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola paused. Olesm hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, wait. I meant the other thing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She started laughing. And then her top was off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm gulped. But then he was laughing too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Strategist Level 33!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Skill – Instantaneous Barrage (Phantom Arrows) obtained!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Lady Firestarter Level 49!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Skill – Conjure Fast Fireball obtained!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">501822</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 02:18:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - 7.22 D</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/497302</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For the brave, the dreamers who yearned to see that which no one had ever seen before, another world was a dream. Earth had so few places left that were unexplored. And of them—they were the depths of the sea, crevasses in the earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Space. But technology had mapped too much. The world was too familiar, in a sense. Too…tame. Even though parts of it could and would eat you and spit chunks out, Earth had so few mysteries left. There was no mysterious land left to imagine. People &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; what the world looked like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And what a tragedy that was. Imagination died as the world shrank into something you could look at on a screen. There was perhaps only one adventure left—and Humans had not yet figured out how to fly through space at speed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But in another world, one full of magic, there were still places where no one had explored. Where the knowledge of even Dragons failed. Challenges that remained, to dare the greatest of adventurers to unearth them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The High Passes were one. The Last Tide and the end of the world, another. The ocean depths were uncharted, even by the Drowned Folk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But there were more areas still. Despite the tens of thousands of years of advancement and regression, new, strange lands still remained. Or rather—they appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zeikhal, Chandrar's great desert, had not always been there. Nor had the growing Bloodfields. But if the Bloodfields was a growing mystery, however dark—there were other places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magic prompted growth. Evolution that nature unaided could have never aspired to. And change sometimes engulfed an area after magical cataclysm, creating another biome at speeds that would have astounded any [Biologist]. And in Baleros—they knew of one such place as The Dyed Lands of Seequal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Once, Seequal had been a prosperous nation. But during the Selphid Empire, the Lizardfolk nation had come under attack. Rather than surrender, their greatest [Mages] had attempted to cast an experimental spell as armies marched on their capital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The result? Magical devastation for hundreds of miles. Both army and nation had been wiped out. But the rampant magic had provoked the natural wildlife to adapt or die. And so—The Dyed Lands had come into existence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Thousands of years later, it was, like the Bloodfields, an encroaching land on the 'normal' jungles and animals. A wild place, full of highly-charged magical plants and animals. A place of wonder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And of course, terrible danger. The kind that had eaten entire armies who had tried to burn The Dyed Lands and establish control. Now, only a few people made their homes there. [Hunters] and [Alchemists] and [Gatherers], looking for new and rare ingredients—Saliss of Lights himself bought the immortal Ske-eel's liquid at a premium for his potions. There was a fortune to be made if you had the wits or courage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But most kept far from The Dyed Lands. It was a kind of death. If you weren't eaten by the swarms of flying midges who would devour you piece by piece, or ran afoul of one of the giant apex predators, like the &lt;em&gt;teleporting cavernous maws&lt;/em&gt; or stumbled into a field of plants whose poison no [Healer] had ever seen before—why would you live there?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Perhaps if you loved adventure. Or perhaps—if you had no choice. A young man had come to The Dyed Lands. And he had lived there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was an explorer. No—not just an explorer. An [Explorer]. From Earth. He had set up a camp fifty miles into The Dyed Lands and ventured forth after wandering into the maze of a biome. He had tried to catalogue the natural landscape. Experimented; found what was good to eat and what was poison. Set traps, hunted for food and other resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he had loved it. He had been a great [Explorer], in a land no one had ever known before. But that was the thing. An [Explorer] could seek out the world's greatest challenges. But eventually, inevitably—they came home. And he had been lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. We found his campsite just last month. I have no idea how he made it in this far. The notes look like he was—trying to get out. He was nearly at the western edge. But they got him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are there—any remains?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman shifted. She ducked her head as the young man read from the [Explorer]'s journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"None I'd care to share, sir. We buried what was left. It was—one of the beasts of the shining zone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The 'shining zone'?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A pause. The woman didn't know how to quite respond so she was quite formal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yessir. The shining zone. The Dyed Lands come in colors. The shining zone is—bright. Monsters hunt by blinding each other. The damn plants make it hard enough to navigate. Some of them are &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;. Claws—fast—it must have been looking for food. Went through all his traps. That was how we found him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly Sullivan looked at the journal and the pictures the [Explorer] had drawn. He might have even catalogued the monster that killed him, so detailed were his notes. He had come into this world a student of some kind. He had a notebook that had been just begun to be filled with notes for a class—and then repurposed for the task of journaling his findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There were words, neat illustrations—even maps. None of which Daly could read. For, the [Explorer] from Earth hadn't been writing in English.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The greatest [Explorer] from Earth had been Indian. Daly recognized the language—somewhat. It looked like Hindi, or rather, Punjabi. Daly recognized it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was not a language the young man from Australia read. Still, the description of the body—and the location matched up. Kirana and her group from Earth had been split up when they first appeared. Some went their own ways and the rest stuck together, to later be killed for thievery or at the hands of [Bandits]. This brave [Explorer] had wandered into The Dyed Lands and never come out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly looked up and met the eyes of the woman who had found the [Explorer]. She was…upright. Her body erect as her long, sinuous tail curled around itself. A few Lizardpeople were part of her exploration team. But their leader was another being entirely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Medusae nodded to Daly as he and the Bushrangers, the Silver-rank team who was part of the United Nations company gathered around him and inspected the journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's miraculous he lived that long, Adventurer Daly. Your pardons, but we were shocked a Human managed to live in The Dyed Lands at all. Even my team only has a border camp. But this [Explorer] survived over &lt;em&gt;five months&lt;/em&gt; there. He must have been a true hero of our class. That's all I can say of him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bowed slightly. And Daly saw her head, humanoid, but filled with little moving snakes instead of hair—turn towards him. He repressed a shiver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, [Adventurer] Mexisa."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Medusa woman bowed. And she &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an [Adventurer]. Not like Daly and his team were, 'Adventurers'. But a true, blue, [Adventurer]. Someone who roamed the last frontiers of the world. Like an [Explorer].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So you found his camp. And the—remains. Anything else?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly looked up. Siri shifted as she glanced about. They were at the edge of The Dyed Lands, and the 'Red Zone', or the Crimson Blend as it was known was ahead of them. Camouflaged plants that would attack you, predators large and small—and you wouldn't even see your blood among all the colors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mexisa shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just the journals, Adventurer Daly. Well-writ they are too. But—coded. As you can see. Awful paranoid, that [Explorer]. But beautiful illustrations. Pardon me, but I copied the illustrations and maps. He charted a vast amount of the Chalklands for us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly nodded absently. The 'code' was just another language. But the Medusa woman wouldn't know that. She had, in fact, sent out a request for someone to decipher the journal she'd found. That was how Daly had picked up the information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll try to decipher it. I think we might know the—code, Miss Mexisa."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Of course. Well then—my team and I would buy whatever notes this fellow had on the wildlife. Anything, actually. We'll share it around—us [Explorers] and [Adventurers] do. It'd be more a service to us that enter The Dyed Lands, sir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bowed her head again. Mexisa was—interesting. She was armed with a machete—two of them—but also a shortbow and arrow, enchanted. Her Lizardfolk team were similarly kitted up, with a lot more gear than most [Warriors] wore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You intend to keep exploring, Miss Mexisa?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Call me Mexy. And—of course! I live to explore places like this. The Dyed Lands consumed an ancient empire. Not that I'm a [Treasure Seeker]. But once I hit Level 40—I might push for the interior, Blue Oblivion. Or—go somewhere else. The High Passes, the Bloodfields—this is my life."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Medusa smiled. Her teeth were sharp. And all of the little snakes on her head were staring at Daly. He sensed one of his teammates shiver—Siri—and Mexy looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me, Captain Daly. But am I bothering your teammates?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly and Siri both chorused. The Swedish girl and the second-in-command gave Mexy an apologetic duck of her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, Adventurer Mexy. But we have an—an image? Of Medusae."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rest of the Bushrangers nodded as they peeked around Daly's back. Medusae. The race that could turn people to stone. Most of them knew the Greek myths. Mexy blinked, and then grinned as Daly explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stone? Oh—&lt;em&gt;that.&lt;/em&gt; That's just a legend. Well—an exaggeration. My hair-snakes? They can't turn anyone to stone. Mine can't, at any rate. If I got the Skill, possible. But these ones are just my extra eyes. Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mexy raised a normal hand and stroked the head of one of her snakes. It rubbed her fingers, twining and &lt;em&gt;staring&lt;/em&gt; at Daly and Siri. The young woman hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They do not—turn you to stone?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, not without a Skill. They're just extra eyes. See? They bite in a fight, but they're a bit like animals connected to me. Like mini-minds. You can touch them, but gently, please."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri reached out. She flinched as one of the snakes coiled around a finger, opening a tiny mouth. They had little eyes, and Daly saw some of them glancing about, keeping a vigilant watch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bloody amazing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dawson breathed. The other young man from Australia looked Mexy up and down. The [Adventuress] was like an action hero out of the movies with her hat and clothes—to cover her humanoid half—mixed with Greek legend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I apologize for any disrespect, Miss Mexy. My team's never met a Medusa before."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She just laughed with good humor as Daly bowed to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry! We're rare among Lizardfolk. I'm used to it. And don't mind my snakes, Miss Siri. They just lick you because they're curious; they really are stupid. If they get cut off, I'll regrow them. That's a Medusae's gifts; we're not as smart as Lamias, but close, not as strong and tough as Gorgons or even Nagas, but we heal and &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;. We're also solitary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She tapped her chest and the Lizardfolk looked up at their leader with awe and respect. A Medusa, one of the Lizardfolk's possible forms they could achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly admired Mexy too. But they'd taken up a lot of her time. And unlike Kami, or Dawson, he was spoken for. So he just nodded to Mexy and hoped none of his teammates tried to chat her up before they left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Once again, Adventurer Mexy, you have our thanks. I think this &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; one of our former companions who got lost."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Poor bastard. I heard about the teleportation spell that got your lot. I'm sorry it came to it too—if we'd pushed in a bit further, we might have found him before the end. But that's how it goes. No one expected to find a damn &lt;em&gt;camp&lt;/em&gt; in the Chalklands. He had a lot of traps; nearly got two of my crew."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mexy gestured to her exploration team. Daly nodded. No grudge here. And indeed—Mexy had done them a favor, asking about. His team had gotten word in Talenqual about the mysterious journal and they'd put two and two together. On a hunch they'd come out this far and recovered the journal. No more would they do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dyed Lands waited ahead. The red jungle was like the Bloodfields—at least, that was what Mexy compared it to. But it was dense and within a few feet you would lose all sense of direction. A hell of confusion. Daly would never enter it willingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Something made a thunderous growling sound in the distance. Daly tensed and his team raised their crossbows. Mexy held up one hand as she reached for her bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hold. If it's the Eatswarms—we run. If it's a Charging Leomouth—we fight. Can't outrun those fast things."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her team whirled. Daly looked around. Siri reached for something at her side. A bag of holding. And in it—a weapon that could probably wipe out even one of The Dyed Lands' larger monsters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A black-powder bomb.&lt;/em&gt; But it didn't come out. The growling sound came again, more distant. Mexy lowered her hand and everyone relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Must be hunting further away from us. We're clear."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly nodded to his team. They relaxed. They had melee weapons and powerful crossbows that even Mexy's team were admiring. Dawson himself had a crossbow that was closer to a ballista—it had two hand-cranks and needed a special contraption to even reload that Paige had worked up. But it could shoot through almost &lt;em&gt;anything, &lt;/em&gt;and it had an accurate range of 97 meters—which was, in American—320 feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even so, Daly wasn't willing to take his team into The Dyed Lands. He nodded to Mexy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you for selling us his possessions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't much more than the journal, but the Medusa had handed it over for a reasonable finder's fee. Steep—but not exorbitant. Daly nodded as he tucked the journal away in his bag of holding. Mexy smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Frankly, Adventurer Daly, Wistram offered more than you and were very interested in the journal. They actually sent envoys even when I told them I'd be selling to another buyer. You beat them by two days."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Silver-rank Captain blinked. He tensed slightly and felt the rest of his team stiffen. He tried to address Mexy casually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded, looking only vaguely interested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They love stuff like this. But I figured it was best to sell to your company. Wistram can complain—if my team isn't on expedition."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled, as her hair-snakes hissed, expressing their contempt. Daly looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you sell the journal to us then, Miss Mexy?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Adventuress] paused. And she looked keenly at Daly. And then she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Last Light of Baleros is in your company. And—it's a 'she', right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly hesitated. And he felt a pang in his stomach. But he nodded, as it all &lt;em&gt;clicked&lt;/em&gt; suddenly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then there's your answer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Medusa explorer bowed slightly. And she and her team looked at Daly's Bushrangers. Mexisa spoke, thoughtfully, looking at the distant Dyed Lands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"An [Adventurer] comes down with all sorts of maladies. I figure it's worth any goodwill if it comes to that. Not that I plan on getting sick or poisoned or hurt that badly, but—I hope you'll remember my name if it does."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. We owe you a favor. And we won't forget it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what she wanted to hear. Mexy smiled. She turned, gesturing at her team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then we won't take up your time. Sorry again for your loss, sir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bowed, and her team headed back to their base camp. Daly stood, holding the journal and the few items the young man from India had kept. A makeshift bow—a faded pocket knife which had helped him skin animals. A few jars of his experimental findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nothing more. Another person from Earth had died. And Daly and his team had found them too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Daly said as they returned to the Centaur-wagons waiting to take them away. It was a bit of a walk; the Centaurs had refused to get close to The Dyed Lands no matter how well they were paid. Daly lost his smile as he walked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the Bushrangers, his team, walked around him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Poor bastard."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Dawson said. He was carrying the huge crossbow on his shoulders. Daly nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Brave bastard, though, Dawson. A right hero. If only he'd made it out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It say anything you can read, boss?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tobi put that in, glancing at the journal. Daly leafed through it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some of the stuff makes sense. But it's all in—Hindi. Pretty sure Kirana might be able to translate it. Or one of the girls."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Indian girls from the United Nations company. Daly put the journal away. His team walked in silence, keeping their footsteps quiet even out of The Dyed Lands. On the alert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were Silver-rank adventurers. And used to moving silent in terrain. The Bushrangers weren't Gold-rank, but only for their arms and style; they tended to ambush their opponents and shoot them to pieces with crossbows. They were doing &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well for a Silver-rank team and ever since partnering with The Rustless Vanguard, they were one of the best non-Gold teams in their area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mainly because their tactics were designed for maximum safety on the part of the adventurers. The Bushrangers could ambush an opponent from the trees, lay down traps, nets—and if the opponent was &lt;em&gt;tough—&lt;/em&gt;they had the bombs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But that was the issue. Daly was silent until Siri spoke up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Funny that Miss Mexy gave us the journal over Wistram because of Geneva. The Last Light of Baleros. Everyone knows her name, right, Daly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Captain replied shortly. Daly saw the Centaurs and the wagons waiting ahead. They brightened as they saw the Bushrangers and began to hitch themselves to the wagons. Siri went on, glancing at Daly as the rest of the team glanced at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You didn't mention that Geneva would rather kick you into The Dyed Lands and leave you there, Daly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Siri. I thought that might not help our case."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shame."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bushrangers looked from Daly to Siri. Dawson opened his mouth, but Kami elbowed him. In silence, they boarded the wagons. And Daly sat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Any orders, Mister Daly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, we got what we came here for. Thanks, Bault. Pihava."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Centaurs grinned at him. They were the two Runners whom Daly and his team had made friends with; they were often the go-tos for his team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No sweat, Daly. You found that Human you were all excited about? Where is he?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Not coming. We didn't get there in time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Uh—sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Centaurs looked at each other. Silently, they began pulling the wagon forwards. Daly felt it jolt into motion as the Bushrangers settled themselves. He kept looking at the journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another Earther, lost. And he had been brave, resourceful; just the sort of person who could survive in another world. But there was only so much you could do alone, against monsters Earth had never witnessed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly leaned back. He looked at some illustrations in the notebook and blanched. The [Explorer] had illustrated his height next to one diagram.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods, that thing's the size of a &lt;em&gt;hill.&lt;/em&gt; Dawson, look at that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Australians glanced at the page. Dawson swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good thing we didn't run into &lt;em&gt;that. &lt;/em&gt;How do we take that thing down? How does anyone?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Most people? Spells. Or a Level 50+ [Warrior] with a magic sword and half a day. Us now…we just need a lot of &lt;em&gt;powder.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly spoke absently. He saw Siri look sharply at him. But the other Bushrangers just nodded. Daly sat back. That was what weapons from Earth were for. You could send a tank company against monsters from this world and it'd be a fair fight. That was what bombs were &lt;em&gt;for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But…Geneva didn't see it that way. Daly put his head back. If he'd told Mexy the truth—it would be that Geneva would treat the Medusa because she treated &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, free of charge if she need be. She was a saint—but a prickly one. And she hated Daly's guts. Had hated them for the last few weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man from Australia sat back in the wagon. He had made his choice. His finger twitched, though he held no crossbow as he closed his eyes. Anyways—he kept out of Geneva's way these days. And for all her objections, this was &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She—had bigger problems anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dyed Lands rested to the south of Baleros, the mighty continent of jungles, snow, beaches, and everything in between.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But mostly jungles and plants. Long trade-roads connected cities which had eradicated the wilderness, but Baleros could easily be said to be the most 'untamed' of the five continents. Rhir of course had the blight, and Chandrar the deserts, but vegetation ruled Baleros as much as the companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It took four days for the Bushrangers to return to their home city, and that was with the Centaurs using stamina potions and their own speed-Skills. The others lived and slept in the wagons, heckling each other, crowding around to watch a rerun of a movie on a tiny smartphone screen—passing the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were headed home. To Talenqual, a port-city, small to medium-sized, ruled by The Featherfolk Brigade, a mercenary company which had seized the city and area and kept control of it to this day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The United Nations company was, by contrast, far smaller. But it had expanded significantly since coming to Talenqual and could now be said to be part of the city. It did not have much firepower as companies went; it was small in number and devoted only to finding more people from Earth and sheltering them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it had individuals of note. The Last Light of Baleros being one of them. Geneva Scala, the [Doctor] who had made her legend on the bloodiest of battlefields, saving lives. Kenjiro Murata, their [Diplomat] who had made peace between many species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan Khumalo, the [Expert Rower] and former Olympian hopeful, already known as 'The Rower of Talenqual', a respected City Runner not least for his part in the Games at Daquin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And last and perhaps least, especially in Geneva's eyes, Daly Sullivan and his Bushrangers, a Silver-rank team that specialized in intercepting monsters and other threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were a good group. Of various disciplines and personalities. But none of them were &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;-level. Except for perhaps Geneva Scala. And it was she who drew the eye. Her name—and the name of their company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United Nations Company. &lt;/em&gt;What a boast. What a &lt;em&gt;farce&lt;/em&gt;, depending on how you looked at it. It was a bold name. An odd one. It spoke to anyone who heard it and was from Earth, though. Of another world. It was a rallying point and it had already attracted other people from Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And more than that—attention from afar. The Titan of Baleros consulted his notes on the small company. And there weren't many. Oh, the United Nations Company got notes because of the Last Light, but little else. They were a tiny company no one paid attention to but for the [Doctor].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that was how he liked it. The Fraerling sighed as he sipped from a teacup. He found it was running low and dunked it in, what was for him, a &lt;em&gt;bucket&lt;/em&gt; of tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A thimble for his students. But Niers had a relationship with caffeine. And Marian and Umina, standing in front of his desk, were used to the Professor's idiosyncrasies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You want us to go to Talenqual, Professor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Marian spoke cautiously. She shuffled her hooves, careful not to bump the table Niers was sitting on. The Titan glanced up from his notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Marian. You and Umina were my first pick, honestly. You can refuse of course, but summer classes are sporadic and Wil and the others are already on their vacation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And Yerra."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Umina sniffed. Marian's head bowed. Niers paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. They are—occupied. But I do not teach many classes. I have a job for you two, as I laid out. If you would take it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He said nothing more of Yerranola, or Wil, or the events at sea. They had discussed it already at length in class. Marian hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Professor. I just don't understand why it should be &lt;em&gt;us. &lt;/em&gt;We—I mean, Umina and I &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;[Strategists]. But we're not Miss Perorn. Or…any of your people."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;By that, the Centaur meant the Forgotten Wing Company's vast lists of assets. Niers nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're dancing, Marian."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sir?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're asking why I don't sent a company, or one of my best [Commanders] to investigate The Last Light of Baleros. Well—perhaps because I like to be subtle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then—why not a [Spy], sir?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan's lips rose. He smirked around his report as he read from a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Pallassian Times,&lt;/em&gt; downscaled to his size. Rather like Olesm's newsletter, actually, only it was about all news in general. He grunted as he read.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps because some of my opponents &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; [Spies], Marian. Moreso than my students, even. There comes a time in a [Strategist]'s life—and I dearly hope you will one day understand what I mean—when one becomes so &lt;em&gt;feared&lt;/em&gt; that people watch your every move. I can't go to the bathroom without alarming Tulm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Umina cut short a snigger. Marian hid a smile. Niers went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why my students? Well—consider it an exercise. I'd like you two to investigate Miss Geneva Scala. A [Doctor] of her level is an &lt;em&gt;asset.&lt;/em&gt; And she is tackling this Yellow Rivers disease."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both students made faces. Niers looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. But I consider it more than just an…inconvenience. It is affecting lands under my domain, or adjacent, and as well as Maelstrom's Howling. It has the potential to be worse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Centauress sobered up at once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see, Professor. But—well—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan looked kindly at her. The Centauress opened and shut her mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But don't you think that sending two of your best students would attract attention as well, sir?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what she didn't ask. Because Niers had obviously thought about it. And if he hadn't—well—how embarrassing, right? The Centauress shuffled her hooves and the Fraerling seemed to take it for uncertainty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just investigate. As I said—you can lure her over to my company, and I certainly have a purse for you. But I do understand you two are new to the job of subterfuge. Do your best. I have faith in you two."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two female students blushed at the compliment. Umina swished her tail, looking at Niers. She didn't ask an obvious question. She wanted to be the one to ask the special one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And her company, Professor? Do we acquire them too?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers' head rose. He gave Umina a blank look and she hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…If that's what it takes to recruit Miss Scala, yes, Umina. But they're not exactly…elite."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardgirl ducked her head and nodded. And she kicked herself for assuming. Niers regarded her, glanced down at his papers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And he was lying to them. &lt;/em&gt;His beloved students looked at each other and Marian bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll head to Talenqual right away, sir! And we'll be as subtle as possible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sure. And I have the utmost faith in you, Marian, Umina."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan put his newspaper down. He saw Marian smile eagerly, Umina glance at his face, searching. But he let nothing slip. The two bowed. And Niers watched Marian slowly back up, so as to be able to turn about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centaur [Spies]. &lt;/em&gt;Oh, the world had many jokes, but Niers would laugh hard at that one. Not that Centaurs &lt;em&gt;couldn't&lt;/em&gt; be [Spies]. But Marian trying to be stealthy hurt his lungs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Still, they were gone. Niers sighed. And though Umina had tried, she hadn't figured out his real intentions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The United Nations company."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan murmured. They were comprised entirely of Humans. All of a certain age range. All…from another world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was his supposition. He wanted them. But—as he'd told Marian, lying by telling the truth, his opponents watched him like hawks. If he sent a company to Talenqual, the Featherfolk Brigade might take it as an act of war. And Tulm might damn well attack his escort depending on how important he thought Niers' assets were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyways, Marian. The point of sending you two is to be &lt;em&gt;subtle.&lt;/em&gt; And I know you'll stick out like a sore thumb. Umina might do well. But let me apologize in advance. Well—you'll adapt. And I'll show you later how I planned it out in advance. If it works, of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan murmured to the ceiling. Then he took another gulp of tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Astoragon? The two [Strategists] have left. Should I bring our guests out of the anteroom now?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers smiled as he waved a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Send them in, Peclir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sat up. And after a moment—after Marian and Umina had left, on their solo, very important mission for the Professor, Niers saw a pair of his students enter the room. They were both visibly excited, but doing their best to appear professional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Professor. You had an…assignment for us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan nodded gravely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Please, sit, Kissilt, Cameral. Take the two reports I have on the desk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Marian and Umina had helpfully left them there. The Drake and Dullahan sat down, looking at each other. Niers began for the fourth time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You two are the first two of my students I had in mind for this assignment. It's a rather simple task, really. Investigate a unique individual. One Geneva Scala, known as the Last Light of Baleros…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kissilt's eyes gleamed. Cameral was hesitant. The two sat in front of Niers. Almost trembling with excitement as Niers gave them his &lt;em&gt;unique and very secret assignment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He felt bad, he really did. But he'd sent three pairs after Geneva Scala already. And this last, the fourth, would ensure that his opponents saw just another assignment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And his students would certainly not leak the information to each other. They'd all been given stipends, similar-yet-different assignments. One of them would procure the [Doctor]. Or—failing that—find out what Niers so desperately wanted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can trust in &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, Professor. Cameral and I are the height of discretion. I learned espionage at Manus. I mean—I had some studies there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kissilt, the Drake, smiled. Niers wanted to roll his eyes. Drake subterfuge—well, okay, they did sabotage well, but they were as bad at it as Centaurs, despite being smaller. Cameral now…the Dullahan only bowed as he fastened his head to his shoulders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will do my utmost, Professor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know, Cameral, lad. Just be discreet as you can. I'm not expecting miracles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers smiled as the Dullahan student bowed his head slightly. And he sighed as they left the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Poor kids. If they run into each other and assume it's my trick, that works. If they all work against each other, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; works. But bring me that [Doctor]. And her company."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From what he understood, Geneva Scala wouldn't abandon her company, especially if they were…like her. The Titan sat back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He could have gone himself. Taken a damn &lt;em&gt;army &lt;/em&gt;to Talenqual and sacked the city. And he'd almost been tempted to do that, if it wouldn't alarm all his enemies. He could have asked his spies—other agents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this worked. And if it worked well? He might have &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; of time on the other Great Companies and his enemies to learn and plan ahead. Tipping his hand in any major way meant an arms race &lt;em&gt;at once. &lt;/em&gt;Information and time won wars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And honestly, Niers had chosen it because it was somewhat—hands-off. He would let his intelligent, young students loose and support them as need be. But he could relax and attend to important matters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And what was more important, pray tell, than another world? A [Doctor] with revolutionary Skills or skills? Nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Or, for the Titan, one thing. He slowly unraveled a tiny, worn bit of parchment. It had arrived only yesterday, and it was already crinkled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It read simply this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gentlemen Callers are in Liscor. Awaiting further instructions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan's hands shook as he put the roll of paper down on the table. He inspected it. Then—sighing, he reached for the artifact and wrote back. And every thought he had left, all of his genius, was focused on one thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Obsession. Hope. Speculation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigate the [Innkeeper]. Code as follows for chess board. Knight to E6, Pawn to A1…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan sat in his office after the message was sent. Sooner or later, he would know. Compared to that—even another world's allure was faint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Love was a terrible thing. The same side of the coin as obsession. If it was her—could she see the same maddening shape of the world he could? The flaws in armies? Could she take a nation to pieces with her mind? Niers Astoragon wished. To meet someone who could keep up with him. No—leave him behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So the Titan of Baleros waited, in his lonely citadel. A towering colossus, held prisoner by his enemy's paranoid fear of his might. Drinking tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Four days later, Daly stretched as he left the wagon at last. His legs &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt;, despite having stretched them out. It wasn't as bad as an airplane. But he still rejoiced in being able to stand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pihava, Bault. Thanks again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah! You blokes do good work! Next time we'll pull &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dawson jumped out of the wagon. The Centaurs laughed good-naturedly. They caught the tip Daly tossed; they'd already been paid through the guild. The Bushrangers looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Home?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri queried Daly. He looked around. Someone was waiting for him, shyly pretending to look the other way. He shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Go on without me, Siri. Take the Bushrangers back. I'll…catch up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Swedish girl sighed. But she saw Daly walking forwards. And the Dullahan, Captain Edima of the Rustless Guard, happened to notice him. She smiled as she fastened her head to her shoulders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bastard. Runs off for his girl the first thing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dawson grunted, but good-naturedly. One of the Bushrangers punched his shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't be jealous."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Me? &lt;/em&gt;He's the one bumping uglies with a suit of arm—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Half the team kicked him before one of the Dullahans walking down the street could take offense. Siri glanced over her shoulder at Daly and Edima.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was—a likely pairing, actually. The Dullahan Captain and Daly had joined their teams together to take on more dangerous assignments. And Edima had fancied Daly since his rescue of her team from the giant serpents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It made sense. Siri sighed as she adjusted the crossbow strapped to her back. The leather was cutting into one shoulder. She needed a more comfortable harness. Maybe Kirana could stitch it up?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nor did she really begrudge Daly from returning to the base. He was…not welcome there. Not recently. The Bushrangers themselves were under scrutiny, Siri included, but Daly was the target of wrath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The United Nations company was in Talenqual, the bustling, predominantly Lizardfolk city. You could see the Featherfolk Brigade's forces supplementing the local watch—those not on campaign, that was. Imposing Nagas or even the towering Gorgons slithered down the street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A few were Quexals, like the leader of the Featherfolk Brigade. But most were more common forms of Lizardfolk evolutions. The Bushrangers walked wide of them; they didn't want to start a fight with the much more powerful Featherfolk Brigade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Home sweet home!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Aldenon called out as he pointed. Siri's heart leapt as they turned down the street and came to the residential district just off the main street where the Centaurs had stopped the wagon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The United Nations company was bigger than before. They now had—and this was a huge step—&lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; houses. All of them large, and set next to each other. Given that it was Talenqual, the houses were practically side-by-side—Lizardfolk didn't mind being squeezed together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they were nice houses. And leased for the next four months. Someone had even put a sign over the left-most house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United Nations Company. &lt;/em&gt;Siri smiled and led her team to the left-most door. She rattled the doorknob, frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Locked?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's new. Maybe everyone's out?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tofte frowned. He hammered on the door. The company's headquarters was almost &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; full of people, coming off their jobs, working different hours—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one opened the door. Siri frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No help for it. Try the other doors?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were all locked. The Bushrangers looked at each other. Siri frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Odd. Try the windows. Get ready."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She circled around the headquarters, warily now. Dawson cursed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And the boss isn't here. Weapons out, Siri?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The street was…calm. Siri reached for her crossbow. Like her companions—she'd fought before. The Bushrangers were a division of the United Nations company that went into combat. Who could handle shooting someone in cold blood. Very few of them had volunteered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Not yet. But hands on your weapons."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She eased the long dagger in its sheathe, ready to draw it. Siri was going around to the side window, which she knew was open almost all the time…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yes, it was open still. The Swedish girl sighed in relief. She motioned the others after her. She reached for the window as Dawson cupped his hands to boost her up—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Don't move. Back away or we'll shoot.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice from above. Siri froze. Two of the Bushrangers swung up their crossbows instantly, slapping bolts into place. They moved with a [Warrior]'s reflexes. There was an oath from above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Damn! Don't shoot! It's the Bushrangers! Lower your crossbows, mates! It's us!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…&lt;em&gt;Blake?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A New Zealander poked his head out the windows. Instantly, the Bushrangers lowered their weapons, removing the bolts. Blake sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn! We nearly shot you, Siri! Didn't you learn to &lt;em&gt;knock?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No one answered the door! What are you doing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri stared up at a pair of crossbows poking out the windows. They were a sleeker design than the ones she and the Bushrangers were using. Blake—one of the newer Earthers that the United Nations company had taken in—shouted down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Being &lt;em&gt;careful!&lt;/em&gt; We had a group try and break in and beat up Luan again! Hold on—let us get the door."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;By the time the Bushrangers came around the front, the door was open. Kirana spotted them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;There you are! &lt;/em&gt;Did you find someone from home? Where is Daly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her face was alarmed. Siri waved one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Edima found him. We found—we'll explain later. Come on. What's this about an &lt;em&gt;attack?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. That. More people after Luan's bounty. He is resting. Come in, come in!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana, the [House Manager], a young woman from India, waved the Bushrangers through the door. She eyed their boots and clothing and blocked Siri.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Carpet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, right. Hey, &lt;em&gt;disrobe&lt;/em&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri shouted at the others. They groaned, but stripped their boots off, placing the dirty apparel on the racks next to the entryway. They'd never have bothered in the old headquarters. It had been a nice place, but frankly—buggy. Dirty, and a bit porous. It had leaked when it rained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the new headquarters was &lt;em&gt;nice.&lt;/em&gt; Cool, even! Siri breathed a sigh of relief as Kirana swept forwards. There was a shout from above. Blake came down the stairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Look at you all! Where's Daly? Did you find anyone? &lt;em&gt;Hey! &lt;/em&gt;The Bushrangers are back!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned and bellowed. Kirana winced. But there was a shout from the adjoining house. People flooded through one of the connecting doors that Miss Hastel had allowed them to install. And then the Bushrangers and Siri found themselves in a sea of questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're &lt;em&gt;back!&lt;/em&gt; Do you have souvenirs?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What were The Dyed Lands like? Do you have any dyes? We're making clothing and we could actually use some that don't cost—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pictures? Dawson, where's my camera? If you've broken it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Earther! Was it just a hoax or…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyone seen my socks? They're the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; socks! Come on, I know someone took them!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;People from Australia, Greece, India—Blake from New Zealand, a small group from Italy, Americans, a pair of Chinese students desperately trying to translate everything—people flooded around the Bushrangers. Laughing, they tried to explain. Siri, more sober, looked at Kirana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A time ago, the young woman from India would have been 'new'. But new were now the Grecian group, and the Chinese students who had been found apprenticing as [Alchemists]. Now, the [House Manager] clapped her hands. She had leveled up. And hers was a voice of authority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everyone! Please let the Bushrangers eat! We will have time to answer questions &lt;em&gt;later! &lt;/em&gt;You are hungry, aren't you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mostly Australian team shouted their affirmative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bloody starving! &lt;/em&gt;Where's the food?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dawson looked around. Kirana smiled and pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right &lt;em&gt;there.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it was being taken out of the kitchen by some of the [Housekeepers], [Cleaners], and members of the group assigned to keeping up the headquarters. Siri smelled spices in the air and fresh bread and her stomach rumbled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The food was predominantly from India, as Kirana managed the kitchens and when she cooked, it was food she knew. The Bushrangers found themselves sitting down and talking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We were too late. There was someone, but he—died. A monster got him. He lasted for five months. And we think he was from your group, Kirana. Take a look."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman's face fell. She took the worn, dirty journal and flipped it open. She gasped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you know him? We couldn't read it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bushrangers exchanged looks. Kirana nodded, her face pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is—Dev. He decided to leave rather than stay. See?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed. The name was written, but again, not in English. Siri put down the &lt;em&gt;naan &lt;/em&gt;bread she'd been about to dip in a sauce, appetite suppressed for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. He lasted five months. A real [Explorer]. Can you read that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. It says—he is writing about how he left our group. This is a journal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. If you could read through it, translate it—it might be worth something. Maybe he found something in the jungle; we have some of his stuff."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana was nodding. Siri looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is…Geneva here? Ken? Paige?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She named the other three heads of the company. Some of the founders. Kirana looked wary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva is—on holiday. Ken is out, two cities over. Trying to convince an [Alchemist] to make &lt;em&gt;penicillin.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fuck. We don't have any yet?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dawson looked up, disgruntled. Kirana shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Paige is upstairs. I will tell her you're here. But there's also—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Bushrangers! Hello!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice shouted from the stairs leading up to the second floor. Siri looked up and broke into a grin. A South African man was leaning over the balcony. Luan, one of the oldest members of the company strode down the stairs. And the Bushrangers shot to their feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Luan! You made it back?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"More like I haven't left for a bit! I've taken a six-day break. I had to stay here—the bounty's attracting more idiots than I can count and business was slow…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Expert Rower] slapped the Bushrangers on the back, ignoring their travel stains and smell. The Bushrangers were laughing as the rest of the Earthers crowded around. Many were missing—mostly, the ones who'd been with the company longest. They had jobs and would come back by dinner, or later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Luan was asking about the missing Earther the Bushrangers had been going to find and Kirana was paging through the journal and exclaiming at the outlandish monsters illustrated there. The [Explorer], Dev, had possessed an illustration Skill so they were unnaturally well-done. Siri was asking about the bounty—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When someone else opened the door. Paige walked into the room. The [Blackpowder Engineer] saw the Bushrangers. And everyone turned to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I heard a commotion."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman spoke into the sudden silence. Siri smiled, but she was one of the only ones. Half of the room—looked away from Paige. As they would have if Daly had come back. The other half, the Bushrangers included, nodded at Paige. But the tension was there and real.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Paige. Come on over."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan waved Paige over, smiling and ignoring the underlying current. Some of the others actually got up and left as Paige walked over. She saw, and hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll—catch up later. Over dinner? Siri, anyone hurt? Daly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri replied steadily, ignoring the glares his name provoked. Paige nodded. She met a few simmering gazes coolly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have new crossbow designs done. Pick them up before you go anywhere. Also—we might need security on Luan. He'll explain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned and left. The door closed and Siri felt the room relax. She looked around and saw Luan sigh. Dawson looked about as he reached for a pot of food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Welcome home.&lt;em&gt; How was it, Dawson? &lt;/em&gt;Bloody fucking awful mate, thanks for asking. We had to fight some monsters on the outskirts of The Dyed Lands and that was no jaunt.&lt;em&gt; Hells! Thanks for doing that, Dawson!&lt;/em&gt; You're welcome. Someone pass the rice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The United Nations company was split. And even Ken couldn't fix it. As Siri washed herself, carefully enjoying the hot water someone had to haul from a well to their building and then heat, she felt it in the headquarters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The company was larger than ever. More people from Baleros were being found with each week. Or—their remains. But they'd expanded, and they had gold. Lots of it, actually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, for a given amount. As adventurers, the Bushrangers were still poor. And the United Nations Company was similarly insolvent by that standard. But if you measured by the layperson's income?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were doing well. Well enough to afford good meat, food, four nice houses (even if Miss Hastel, the Centauress [Landlady] was giving them a discount), and a lot of amenities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even a [Repair] spell from one of their new [Mages]. Myron, from Greece. The United Nations company had lighting—someone had actually installed a flashlight in one area, just hanging from the ceiling since it was free light so long as you cast [Repair] on it. They had laptops for movies, which were on rotation that everyone shared, bug-free housing, beds for all—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were divided. The Bushrangers enjoyed a good welcome, because they were hard-workers who pulled in a lion's share of coin for the company. Paige and Daly—did not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They bore most of the blame, even though Siri was always burningly aware of the charge of black powder that Paige had given her. It could and &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; blown up larger monsters; it was weaker than modern explosives from Earth, but it was still capable of tearing stone or hides apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that bothered some people. Anyone from Earth who was leery about bringing well, &lt;em&gt;firearms&lt;/em&gt; to this world. Who saw that was going from self-defense or the need to make money like the Bushrangers did to importing dangerous technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And none more so than Geneva Scala. She &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; the weapons. And half of the United Nations company was on her side. The other half saw it as necessary, or, if not &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;, understandable. You needed bombs to kill an Adult Creler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But both sides were split. And that night, Siri found herself eating with Paige and a smaller group, not including Luan; some of the Bushrangers were eating with what would be Geneva's side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly hadn't come back yet. He, as the instigator of the entire split, was aware of the rift he caused, and stayed with Edima, who was aware of the schism, but blissfully unaware of the details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some of the others want me to stop producing the bombs. But I generate black powder every day. That's my &lt;em&gt;Skill.&lt;/em&gt; Besides—I agree with Daly. Even if I think we should have told Geneva. At least no one's tried to sabotage me. Mainly because they might upset the black powder. That's what I hint, anyways, although I have it safely stored."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige was speaking to Siri. The Swedish girl rolled her shoulders. She was still uncomfortable herself. It had been months since the reveal. And still—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How are you dealing with Daly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're not &lt;em&gt;happy.&lt;/em&gt; But we settled it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri folded her arms. Paige nodded. Daly keeping the secret about the bombs so long was what Siri had been most annoyed by. Paige hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyways. That's not something that should overshadow your return. I'm sorry we missed that [Explorer]. What was his name?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dev."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Australian woman hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll add it to the list."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked up. &lt;em&gt;The List. &lt;/em&gt;Ken had proposed it. It was a list—the definitive list as best they could make it—of everyone from Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Living and dead. Ages, names—homes—and next of kin. Even phone numbers, email addresses. In case someone got home. Or in case someone found it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was reassuring, in some way. Horrible in another. Not that Siri thought about her family much. Not unless—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Swedish girl found herself lifting something. Her arm. The inside of it was tattooed with silver. The names of her family. Her brother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes she forgot she had a brother. &lt;/em&gt;Siri stared at it as Paige averted her eyes, digging into the food. Luan had a tattoo just like it, in gold. It was a growing trend among some of the company. Tattooing the names so that they wouldn't forget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…So. Luan's back. He's resting up. Sorry about the locked doors. But Blake and some of the others are keeping a guard out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We need a guard? For what? Crime?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Luan. You know that bounty? Word's gotten out. He can't walk down the street without a few [Toughs] threatening to beat him up. They won't tangle with our crossbows, but some of them even try to attack his boat at the harbor. It's locked away, but—damn that Xol or whoever it was."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri grimaced. So did Paige. For whatever reason, Xol of the Iron Vanguard had possessed an unusual grudge against Luan after the events of Daquin. Enough to put a fifty-gold bounty on Luan's head. Not to kill him—but to beat him up and trash his boat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's getting to the point where Luan's been suggesting we let them rough him up. But we don't know how serious they'll get. The last group had knives out; Kirana chased them off with a crossbow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Swedish girl laughed and choked on her food. Paige grinned, but she was worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyways, the Runner's Guild won't remove the bounty. No one wants to offend The Iron Vanguard. But we're keeping Luan with bodyguards. No one wants to make an open enemy of &lt;em&gt;Geneva&lt;/em&gt; either, so it's only idiots and desperate people. For now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Ranger] nodded. Siri shifted in her chair as Paige brought out something. A hand-crossbow, small, but made of &lt;em&gt;steel.&lt;/em&gt; And wood, but the bow was spring steel. One of the Bushrangers whistled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Nasty.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've upped the range and punching power. This hand-crossbow isn't one of the torsion ones that the Greek-lot helped me make; I'm still improving it. But we might actually be able to mount a mini-ballista on a wagon. I'll let you know. Quallet's bought three dozen already."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How're Gravetender's Fist doing these days?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige smiled as Siri investigated the crossbow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well. They're healthy, which is better than some other companies. They won a battle. Crossbows at range; the enemy never even closed. Quallet pays for my new designs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The United Nation's company had many sources of income. The people working jobs, but also—Paige's crossbows. Luan's deliveries. The Bushranger's missions. But also, and disconcertingly, the primary income was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And we've actually got the manufacturing up to…speed. We're pulling in &lt;em&gt;gold&lt;/em&gt; for Geneva's condoms. If you can believe it, it was more than you hauled in last month. And her clinic is earning &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of money—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others groaned or laughed. Siri shook her head. That was her. Geneva. The Last Light of Baleros. Say what you would about the others—she was their icon. People didn't make enemies of their company because of &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; They did favors, like Mexy, because of her reputation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Last Light of Baleros. The only [Doctor] from Earth. Geneva Scala.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri paused. It occurred to her she hadn't seen Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is she still working at the clinic?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige shook her head. But then—Geneva stayed away from her. She bit her lip, and then shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's spending all of her time in the clinic. Doing C-sections, teaching the [Midwives], healing anyone who comes in—but also tending to the Yellow Rivers patients. They're growing in number. Geneva is getting really worried this is an epidemic. The bacteria—mutated across all her patients. It's not just sex, now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri put down her fork. She looked at Paige, worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And if it is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva is trying to find penicillin. She's also going to talk with the leader of the Featherfolk Brigade—Fezimet. Tomorrow. You can ask her if she gets back. If she…&lt;em&gt;sleeps.&lt;/em&gt; She doesn't, sometimes. She's driving herself into a wall."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She needs to rest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The second-in-command of the Bushrangers murmured. She'd seen Geneva at work. Or 'relaxing'. Siri had seen stones being smashed by waves on the beach who relaxed better than Geneva. She worked herself to the bone and beyond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe we should talk to her. If she knows Daly came back she might shout at him. Or—she would want to see the [Explorer]'s diary. There may be something he found that was useful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;To Siri's surprise, Paige did smile at that. She shook her head slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry. Geneva is on a holiday. Today, at least."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You gave her a holiday? With people getting sick?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;What Geneva was &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt; The Geneva that Siri knew would work without sleep if someone had sprained a foot. But Paige just sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The other Geneva."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course. Siri nodded slowly; even the others didn't know. But she did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Geneva. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; Geneva had changed…too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a very funny thing. They knew that Geneva hated violence. She hated the idea of bombs for the same reason she hated anything that would kill people. Injure people in the ways that haunted her sleep. Because she had sworn an oath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was wrong to say that Geneva Scala hated weapons. She would use any possible one that was offered to her, that she could grab. And she fought her war, a terrible war against the kind of foe that never gave up or relented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a bitter war. And she fought it alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alone.&lt;/em&gt; She had…allies. But there were things they could help her with. And things only she could do. Most of them didn't even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the problem. They called it a 'troublesome disease', but they didn't worry. As if you could contain a plague with words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No, no. There was only her. And she worked from dawn to dusk, counting time only by when she worked by magical light or by daylight. Time had lost meaning for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Time had lost all meaning. Geneva Scala sat in a room. It was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A room. Describing it was beyond hard. You couldn't talk about the light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because there was no light. There were no shadows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was no floor. Geneva was sitting. But here was no chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There were no walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet it was a box. A room. There was only her. And her thoughts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But what clear thoughts. What vivid imagery. Geneva Scala could see Talenqual, flickers of memory piecing together to give her an aerial view, like when she'd stood on the top of one of Talenqual's buildings and looked around. She could see the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;There. And there. And there.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Brothels. Infection spots.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] whispered. Marking the spots in her memory perfectly. Knowing where they were, how to get there. She spoke, but there was no sound. No air in this room either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wasn't breathing. This was just thought. Perfect, clear—Geneva was doing calculations in her head effortlessly. Sums of money, using up the budget she had, recalculating it, finding out how many [Alchemists] she could hire, how much it would cost to scale up production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Have to check the petri dish.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another thought. Geneva anchored it in her mind so she wouldn't forget. It was so—convenient here. She could think about &lt;em&gt;thinking.&lt;/em&gt; Memory was easily accessible to her; she could replay images, compare Yellow Rivers patients and the way they differed in minute detail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was the kind of Skill another person from her world would give so much for. Someone conducting research, for instance, mathematicians—Geneva's mind was clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—there was one thing she didn't control. It was like—well—to her—a television screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An all-encompassing one, though. If Geneva looked at it, she was &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. Seeing through—her eyes. If she tried, she could taste. Hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nom. Nom. &lt;em&gt;Nali-sticks.&lt;/em&gt; Love them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The voice was hers. And not hers. Geneva Scala watched. Then she directed her attention towards finding solutions outside of a vaccine. She was doing calculations, remembering her notes from a single lesson on plague statistics in clear detail—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Huh.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] glanced up. She was…on holiday. Yes, on holiday. Or at least, that was what Paige thought. The truth was more complex. Geneva peered at something, tapped on the television screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"…Okasha. What are you doing?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva giggled. She felt herself speaking in a higher-pitched voice. Even her face felt—different. The muscles were being used differently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—you were &lt;em&gt;there?&lt;/em&gt; During the battle with the [Strategists]? And the Swords of Serept? &lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The female [Storm Sailor] laughed and her two mates grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure were. We sail under Lord Seagrass' command. Hell of a fight. We were battling those damn Bloodtear Pirates, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tap, tap. Geneva saw/felt herself raise a mug, swallow. Alcohol rushed through her system, that bitter, lovely intoxication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Okasha. I have work tonight."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her voice wasn't a voice at all. And she—was leaning forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can you tell me more about—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Okasha!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I hear you! Shut up, shut up! This is &lt;/em&gt;my&lt;em&gt; time! And I'm trying to get—us—lucky!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice snapped back. It came from the entire room. Geneva frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"No. Sex. We agreed on that. Anyone could have the Yellow Rivers disease. Okasha—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Fine! Shutupshutup! Go away! I still have an hour left!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then the projection of Geneva in the actual world vanished. Geneva blinked. She tried to make it come back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this was not her Skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. What are you doing? I can't see."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Fine! Let me be!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva saw the viewpoint appear again. Her flirting with the [Storm Sailors] was much more subdued, and they had picked up on her vibe and were looking discouraged. Geneva Scala went back to thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Okasha took Geneva's body. She was smiling, drinking, apologizing to the [Storm Sailors]. She was Geneva—and not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her face was different. Her vocal range higher. The Selphid could do that to Geneva's vocal chords at will, even change her facial muscles. The skin tone and eyes stayed the same, but it was amazing how different you could &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was—Okasha. Her look, separate from Geneva's. They had agreed it was how Okasha could go about. Do her own thing without it being connected to Geneva. And this was her time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ever since the incident with Xeppal, things had changed between Geneva and Okasha. Conscious of the Selphid's growing need for independence, trapped as she was to allow Geneva to move despite her shattered spine, Geneva had worked out a deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha got three days out of the week, and six hours on each of those days. Six hours to be her, to go and eat food, see what she wanted, gamble, watch movies—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sex with other people was off limits. But most other things were not. Okasha could pilot Geneva's body; that was what Selphids did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But normally Geneva would be conscious, feeling and seeing all these things, and obviously distracted. And &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;, displeased if it was something she didn't like doing. Like watching a movie with idiotic [Doctors] in it or something. For the first two days she and Okasha had squabbled despite it being 'Okasha-time'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Until Okasha had leveled up. And gained a new class. Her new class—which both she and Geneva had been perplexed by was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Inner Friend].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she had a new Skill. This place Geneva was in—this was a Skill. It allowed Okasha to separate Geneva's mind from her body, place her in a spot where she could think and devote her entire brain to simply…thinking. While Okasha took over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Skill was named [The Thinking Room]. No, that wasn't quite right. It was [Host: The Thinking Room].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because it was a power a Selphid only had when they inhabited a &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; body. Okasha was the first Selphid in current memory to gain a class like this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva went back to thinking. And time did indeed have no meaning; because in this room, the thinking box as she and Okasha referred to it—she was disconnected from the outside world. Geneva only checked back into reality after a while—and realized she was leaning against a [Storm Sailor], recalling her own encounter at sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Okasha. What time is it?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva saw out of the corner of her eye that the sun was quite low. The Selphid didn't reply at first. She was all-consumed with spinning the yarn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Okasha—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;And then I&lt;/em&gt;—hold on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha broke off as the [Storm Sailors] snorted and nearly fell over laughing. She whispered into the box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What? I'm having a great time!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It's time for me to get to work, Okasha. Give me control."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"What? No, it's not! It's—aw, Creler eggs."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva-Okasha turned her head and her face fell at the sight of the fading sun. Geneva, in the box, insisted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You promised.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Five more minutes?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"No."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oh—fine! But let me excuse myself!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grumpily, the Selphid turned and began explaining that she had to go. Geneva, in the box, watched, annoyed, as Okasha had to stand a round. The [Storm Sailor] let her go, laughing, and Geneva staggered out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine, take your stupid body back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva-Okasha muttered. Geneva was suddenly back &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; her body. She wobbled, and nearly ran into a pair of [Sailors] who were laughing on their way to the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Okasha!&lt;/em&gt; Get rid of my intoxication!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] gritted her teeth and whispered. Inside her body and now just aiding Geneva, the Selphid grumped back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Fine! Fine! Your stupid liver's working, but I'll go kick it. There!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva felt her head clearing at speed. Accordingly, her bladder. She looked around. The [Sailors] blinked after her. One of them checked her mug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods. She looks different all of a sudden. What're we drinking?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman from Italy walked out of the bar. Her facial muscles ached from keeping up her 'Okasha' face. And she needed to pee. But Okasha dutifully suppressed both feelings, relaxed her muscles. Geneva felt fresh, despite having been up since dawn. More Okasha-help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Now back to work. Bleh. Have fun treating disgusting patients all night. You know you need to sleep? It's not good for your body. I worry about you, Geneva. Your smile muscles are all rusty, too!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva ignored Okasha's voice. She walked on, looking for a place to pee, and heading back to the United Nations headquarters. Her mind was echoing all the thoughts she'd come up with in the thinking box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check the petri dish. Hotspots of diseases. Spread of disease based on calculations—funding is—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It did help her refocus. Even so, as Geneva walked, she was glad to be in charge. Okasha had her needs. But Geneva needed to save lives. And they were in a pandemic, a growing one. She was sure. Okasha had her needs, which was why Geneva had allowed it until today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it's going to get worse. I can't allow it for the foreseeable future."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hm? What was that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva walked on. She got back to work. And—in her mind, the place Okasha couldn't read or reach, only her body—Geneva was a bit relieved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd tried to take back command while she was in [The Thinking Room]. Several times, actually. But if Okasha knew it or not—Geneva hadn't been able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello, Geneva! Have you eaten? Have you slept? The Bushrangers are back—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana welcomed Geneva as the [Doctor] unlocked the door. The woman shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's me, Kirana. Not Okasha. She ate. I'm well awake. Is there any tea? Did we discover coffee? I'm going to be working in my clinic. I'm just here for—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She backed up as she strode past the [House Manager]. Geneva paused. And Okasha, inside of her, winced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Uh oh. Angry juice incoming! Stop squirting that. Stop that. Stomach acid here, ew, ew…ooh! I remember eating that…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She squirmed around in Geneva's body, suppressing the natural fury coursing through Geneva. Kirana winced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. They got back a few hours ago…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did they find anyone? Is anyone hurt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—they were dead. And no one was hurt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva Scala paused. She looked at Kirana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was someone from your group, wasn't it? I'm sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana only nodded soberly. It was—amazing. Painful, how someone could be used to death. Geneva wished she had the background in therapy to know what to say. Even her bedside manner was—that of a battlefield surgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. I'll…see the Bushrangers later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had no desire to see Daly, or Siri, or anyone else in the team. Geneva headed towards the stairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In one of the four houses the United Nations company now occupied, there was a sealed room with a reinforced, air-tight door. Geneva didn't like having it with an actual population of people living nearby, but it was that or the clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the clinic could be broken into. Had been, three times, by [Healers] hiring low-level [Thieves] to snoop around and steal Geneva's scalpels and other tools, looking for her 'secret recipes'. Rather than let them walk off with something truly dangerous, Geneva had agreed to install this door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So this house was reserved for business, entertainment—Paige's workshop. Not with many beds in them. Just in case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Just in case, Geneva would burn the entire house down if she thought there had been a breach. But she needed to do her research somewhere. She marched up the stairs. And on the way met another distraction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva! Hello. Are you fed? Rested? I haven't seen you all day. For two days, actually."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan smiled on the stairs. Geneva sighed. Why did &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; greet her like that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's me, Luan. Not Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gave her a strange look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was obvious."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She blinked a few times at him. He touched his face, turning it into a semi-permanent cross between a frown and a dour stare. Geneva hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't look like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes you do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her mouth answered for her. Kirana and Luan &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt;, but grinned as Okasha's voice spoke. Luan nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi, Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi, Luan! You wouldn't believe who's in the harbor! I met some [Storm Sailors] who were &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; the battle at sea!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? What—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm working. Okasha can tell you later, during her time off. Luan, I'd love to chat. I hear the Bushrangers are back without incident. Good. I wish they'd found someone alive, I mean."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva brusquely overrode her mouth. She walked past Luan. The South African man eyed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The person who died was Dev. An [Explorer]. He was in The Dyed Lands. He had a journal. Kirana thinks he might have found some interesting plants or animals."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] stopped on the stairs. Luan glanced at Kirana out of the corner of his eyes. And then Geneva was striding back down to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anything useful? Plants? Animals? Even toxins? Let me see the journal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana showed it to Geneva. The [Doctor] flipped through it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can you read it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. There's some notes about helpful things. For healing. Daly even brought back some of Dev's supplies. We are looking through them—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva nearly dropped the journal. Her head snapped up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have some of his equipment?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Don't touch any of it! You have no idea what could be in his gear! Parasites or poisons! Where is it?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan and Kirana glanced at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Paige has—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva was up the stairs in a flash. She strode over to the [Engineer]'s door and began hammering on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Paige! Open up! Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; open those samples without—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The door opened at her touch. Geneva strode in and saw Paige.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was wearing a huge suit of…well, armor. Protective gear. Treated leather with glossy resin, foul-smelling but all-encompassing. She even had a &lt;em&gt;glass&lt;/em&gt; mask, carefully made to allow her to see without letting anything actually touch her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige's voice was cool. She was investigating the contents of a satchel. Geneva saw large pots of paste, some crumbling red powder—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have the protective gear on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. And you're in the room unprotected. Didn't you see the sign?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva backed up. The sign on Paige's door read, 'DO NOT ENTER'. The [Doctor] hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I was concerned—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Parasites? We had the jars frozen once they arrived. And Daly and the others kept them securely contained in bags of holding. Nothing was opened; they still want to be tested. And I'm investigating. See?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She held up a magnifying glass. More crude glass, like the mask she wore. Paige glanced at Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good to see you. Hi, Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi, Paige."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva waved at Paige. Then she slapped her other hand down. She backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm…getting to work. Sorry about…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shut the door, please. Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] closed the door silently. She turned to Kirana and Luan. They were eying her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll check Paige later. Something could still be living in the room. We'll still sterilize—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I put down poison and the room was secured until you opened it.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige shouted from inside the room. Geneva's mouth closed. She turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm getting to work. I need to be at the clinic tonight. I'll talk to you later, Luan, Kirana."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two chorused. Geneva hesitated. She disappeared into her secure laboratory, next to Paige's. Luan studied it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In retrospect, it was a mistake to put their rooms together, yeah?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But if something gets loose, we can explode Paige's workshop. Or if it explodes, it kills the germs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [House Keeper] countered. Luan smiled crookedly. He glanced up at Geneva, and then turned to Kirana. The young Indian woman was leafing through the journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Is&lt;/em&gt; there anything Geneva can use? She's stressing about the Yellow Rivers plague. It's getting bad. We could use a win, Kirana."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know. I don't think so. He used this…paste for his cuts. In one of the jars. I will tell Paige. But it stopped bleeding. Not cured sickness. He was sick here. See?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She showed Luan a dated entry. He nodded, although he couldn't read.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anything interesting?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venoms from a…purple place. Daly will want them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tell Geneva."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She won't like it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; her because the venoms might be a cure. Or useful in her research. I think that's how it works."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan shrugged helplessly. Kirana nodded. She read a few more bookmarked spots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There is…one more interesting thing. Monsters aside. But I have to ask Daly. This Dev. He was alone, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. He never made it out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Rower] leaned on the balcony, suddenly tired. He looked at Kirana. She was younger than him by…seven years. But she felt older. They were all growing up. Still, he and Geneva were the oldest. Adults. But for all Luan admired Geneva—she could be less mature than the nineteen year-old young woman from India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana nodded. Her eyes flicked across the page. Then she showed him something else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here. Something strange. Right on this day. He met someone in The Dyed Lands. Someone—scary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Scary?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan frowned. There was a picture. A man, standing in the doorway. All shadow, but Dev had captured some features. Not enough. Just enough to make Luan…uneasy. The [Explorer] had captured his mood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Another [Explorer]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana read on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. He got past all of the—traps. And he left no footprints. Dev was afraid. It says the man offered him something. Wanted Dev to take his hand. He thought—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hesitated. And then closed the book abruptly. She blinked a few times. Luan looked at her. Kirana had suddenly gone pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing. He just wrote that he thought it was a &lt;em&gt;bhoot.&lt;/em&gt; Or—something worse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A—&lt;em&gt;bhoot?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A…ghost. Or a—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She searched for a while. Then she put the journal away and didn't open it any longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A devil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan felt his skin crawl. You could laugh at something like that on Earth. In the daylight. But in this world? Here? Nothing was off limits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;People said the gods were dead. So—sometimes, Luan stayed awake at night and wondered. If the gods were dead—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What killed them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did he take the hand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all he could think to ask. Kirana shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. He wrote that he did not. The—man vanished. No footprints. Dev died months afterwards."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So no correlation. Luan sighed. But Kirana still looked bothered. That story would bother Luan too, if he let it. He needed a drink. He sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe it was a [Rogue], or high-level explorer. Or a nightmare?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"When did it happen, anyways? Daly can ask that [Adventurer] he met if she knows anyone like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kirana cracked the journal open. She frowned at the date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In the middle of winter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan was walking down the stairs. He stumbled. Looked over his shoulder. Kirana blinked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man felt his skin turn icy. And something was crawling down his back. He hesitated, and then shivered.&lt;em&gt; No way. &lt;/em&gt;But—absolutely. His hand &lt;em&gt;itched&lt;/em&gt;. Luan kept walking, hurrying for the kitchens. He'd have a drink, ask later. In the daylight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was relieved, though. Luan had assumed it was a dream, a nightmare at sea, while rowing. But that made it seem—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He was so glad he hadn't touched her hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Geneva, I'm really worried for you. You can't keep working like this. I can remove fatigue from your muscle, but not that brain-thing! You can't keep doing this!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An hour later, Geneva sat in her laboratory. It wasn't sterile, white tiles, stainless steel, or anything as good. The floorboards were wood. She'd installed a metal door, made the room airtight as possible. That meant she had to open a window, but she kept it closed when she was working with anything serious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she too had protective gear on. Geneva had designed it herself. There was no &lt;em&gt;plastic&lt;/em&gt; in this world, so she had to rely on resin layers, cleaning…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Soap, rather than antiseptic. Fragile glass, and a rear vent for oxygen rather than an actual &lt;em&gt;tank.&lt;/em&gt; It would keep out liquids, but not gas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It helped for the Yellow Rivers treatments. Geneva checked the setting sun. Nearly time to get to the clinic. She heard the voice again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Geneva? Are you listening?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] snapped irritably. She heard Okasha's voice in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I've been talking for the last thirty minutes! You're not listening again! You're &lt;/em&gt;tired.&lt;em&gt; Get some rest."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can keep going. Thanks to your breaks, I need to make up time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You also need to sleep."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not yet. Be quiet. I'm testing the cultures."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some things she'd reclaimed from her world. The glass petri dishes and cultures inside made Geneva's skin tingle. She wasn't qualified for this. But she was more qualified than anyone else in this world. She stared at the growing yellow amid the red. Cursed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing's killing them. Nothing—has Ken gotten those [Alchemists] to work on an anti-bacterial yet? Don't they know how important this &lt;em&gt;is?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. He's trying, but not many of them like working with mold, Geneva. We're all trying. Did none of the treatments work?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment, Geneva thought the voice was coming from Okasha. But it wasn't. She looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Paige! Stay—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman was wearing her protective gear. Still, Geneva glowered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I told you never to open this door when I'm working! It was locked! How—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kirana has the key. Anyways, you said it wasn't airborne."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As far as we know. It's mutated once. It can do it again. What's that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva pointed. Paige had two substances in crude, earthenware pots. She offered both to Geneva; one was a purple, viscous substance that made Geneva's instincts instantly wary. The other was a reddish paste, mixed with green.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Samples from our [Explorer]. One was an ointment he used on himself. Stopped the bleeding."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A coagulant?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. And the other's a venom. He coated a spear with it. Thought it might be useful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva studied both. She reached for the samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could—add them to cultures. See if they work. I doubt they will."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Try it. The venom might be overkill, but if you could…I dunno, dilute it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was worth a shot. Geneva nodded. She eyed the pots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I want those stored in a sealed container."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yep. Just take a sample of each."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige held them out as Geneva found a tiny spoon, took a sample of each, and smeared them into the other petri dishes. Paige sealed both pots and then eyed the dishes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva had eighteen, each with yellow spreading across the red cultures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's the verdict, Geneva?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] paused, but she replied, stiffly avoiding Paige's eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"See this? This is the Yellow River strain. I've cultured it—which means it's bacterial."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She lifted the petri dish. It was open, and Paige saw the telltale, sickly yellow pus growing amid the red. She made a face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's disgusting. How is it growing? What's the medium?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a combination of blood, some tissue mixed with the sugar jello—the sample grows best on that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva saw Paige eying the culture. She spoke on, hurriedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's mine. Not from anyone else. I had Okasha extract it from me. But it's all dead matter; a virus wouldn't survive. Bacteria would."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So that's why you need the penicillin so bad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To be precise, we need an anti-bacterial agent which works on a broad spectrum. Penicillin is one example. The odds are that this world will have another variety that we just don't know about. Now—I need to take this dish to my meeting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Didn't you say you never wanted this taken out of the lab?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige saw Geneva place the petri dish in a larger glass container and seal the lid. The [Doctor] nodded brusquely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I did. But the Yellow Rivers disease is already &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Talenqual. And unless we get the support of The Featherfolk Brigade, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; spread. We need action from every major city in the region. Lockdown of the ports! More [Healers]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She slipped and the glass container skidded across the desk. Both women lunged for it—Okasha grabbed the case. Geneva steadied herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're tired."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige breathed out shakily as Geneva's hand slowly put the dish back on the counter. Geneva inspected the container for cracks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm fine. I slept last night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You say that as if that's unusual. Geneva—can we talk?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"About what? How to most effectively use your powder bombs? Make an IED. Those kill very effectively. You can leave them in the ground for generations. Landmines that blow up children."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva snapped back. Paige turned pale. She straightened abruptly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm trying to talk this over. Unless you think the Bushrangers should take on giant serpents and Crelers with &lt;em&gt;crossbows&lt;/em&gt;?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not saying that. But when do they start using them on other people?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Probably around the same time those people try to kill us. Geneva, you can weigh in on this. We can figure out something—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I told you what I think."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can't stop it. Geneva, I've seen [Fireballs]. So have you. They're worse than grenades. And that's a Tier &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; spell. I'm not saying I like it. But when Daly asked, I agreed. Because it's not a gun."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, it's a &lt;em&gt;bomb.&lt;/em&gt; I don't have time for this, Paige. I can't stop you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva stood up abruptly. She stalked past Paige with the secured sample and then turned. She poked at Paige through their protective gear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; you. But I'll never approve of it. You know it's wrong."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Australian [Engineer] exhaled loudly. She saw Geneva open the door and walk out; the lab was secure. Paige shouted after Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know it's not perfect! But I'm trying my best! I'm trying to talk, to be reasonable! So is Daly! &lt;em&gt;You're&lt;/em&gt; the one who says 'do it my way or fuck off'! What would you have us do? You know, Geneva Scala, you're not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; person who's right in this world!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] never replied. But Okasha whispered in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ooh. She's got you there.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shut up, Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The clinic. Geneva marched in, ignoring the looks people gave her. In her protective gear she was like a [Knight]. Only, one whose protection was against malady, not spells or swords.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aiko. Sorry I'm late. How are the patients?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva! They are—good?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Nurse] hurried over. Aiko Nonomura, a young Japanese woman, was clearly tired. But she and another [Nurse]—one of the young Indian women—were both in the protective gear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Luan's gold had paid for more than just the new headquarters. So had condom sales. Geneva put down her burden as she looked around. She heard voices from further in her clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Any new cases?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Many. We had to turn away…all but three. The ones who were worst. They—are—good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The word 'good' was clearly up for debate. Priya, the [Nurse], was pale. She had volunteered for this job, despite her main class being [Cook]. But Geneva had needed the hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll check on them, then. Can they still eat? Take liquids? Dehydration is what will kill them. The bedpans—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Washed. What is that…container?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Aiko gagged and Priya shuddered. Geneva nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I need to speak to Fezimet tomorrow. That's a sample of the disease. Don't touch it. Wait, you're going off-duty, aren't you? Remember, wash down the gear. Take isolated baths—if you have so much as a fever or poor digestion, I want you to quarantine—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two exhausted [Nurses] were nodding wearily. They knew the procedure, but Geneva had to be &lt;em&gt;sure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In that case—go on. I'll need Zane and you, Aiko, tomorrow morning. Priya, can you manage the evening? Good. Get some rest—and thank you so much for working so hard."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Aiko smiled wearily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are welcome, Geneva. You have to rest too, alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She patted Geneva on the shoulder. The [Doctor] nodded silently. She hadn't thanked the two. She'd forgotten to. It had been Okasha who'd done that. With her voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Silently, the two [Nurses] left the room, heading to the chamber Geneva had made for them to clean themselves before leaving. That left the [Doctor] to make her rounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No new C-sections. No patients with major maladies besides the Yellow Rivers patients. And…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva walked into her clinic. She looked at the first patient, on the bed. The Lizardman was looking up at her. His bandages were clean. But he had flushed scales. His temperature was far too high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Geneva."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sighed as he looked at her. The [Doctor] sat down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How are we today, Teqis? I'm sorry I couldn't arrive earlier."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Better. I'll be better. The two lovely [Nurses] were—wondrous to us. There are three more."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned. Down the clinic, separate cots had been set up. There were twenty two patients in the clinic now. It was overcrowded. But each patient was running a high fever. Had diarrhea—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the open, growing, pus-filled wounds. Usually on their genitals, but now—spreading to other areas. They were regularly cleaned, but Geneva saw a telltale yellow and red dripping from Teqis' clean bandages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only, it had stopped when the [Doctor] walked in. For a moment, there was relief. The Yellow Rivers disease halted in its consumption of skin, spreading through the immune systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Malady's Cessation]. The Skill will get you an hour of time. I want you to rest, drink more fluids—hopefully you'll begin fighting this off. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; recover, Teqis. You're in your second week; this is when your immune system will begin fighting off the disease. I want you to remember that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardman's eyes were watery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will. My family stopped by, and I was feeling better."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva's mouth opened worriedly. The Lizardman went on, hurriedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They weren't allowed in. But I could shout to them. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; better than the first week, [Doctor]. Thank you. I might—you're our savior."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured around the clinic. The other patients were sighing, as the Skill helped them. For an hour, they could recover, fight back as the infection halted. Geneva clasped Teqis' hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not doing enough."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nonsense. You're the Last Light of Baleros."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He laughed weakly. Geneva looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have to talk to the others, Teqis. But I'll be here most of the night. One of the [Nurses] will come in to help; if you need anything, just call."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will. Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardman lay back, closing his eyes. Geneva walked on. The next patient was a Centaur, Biha. A Dullahan—two more Lizardfolk—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Am I late? Sorry, I had to change into the gear."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Nurse] walked in an hour after Geneva had seen to all the patients. Blake, another volunteer, paled as he inhaled the odor in the room. Geneva's Skill had ended. The [Doctor] looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's fine. See to the patients. I've changed the bedpans—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the symptoms was diarrhea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—but we may need more water. Remember to add the lemon and sea salt and honey."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Blake was nodding. To replenish electrolytes and other elements, Geneva had come up with the drink along with the food they fed the patients. It saved lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm heading out. I need your help scrubbing me down—then I'm going to visit the other patients. Do you have a list?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here. They added twenty entries today alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Blake handed Geneva the list. Okasha made a sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;So many…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] didn't blink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll visit all of them. Just change the bandages. Send a Street Runner if there's a complication. Remember, the poultice—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, [Doctor]. We're running out of ingredients and honey."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tell Kirana to buy more."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] walked into the changing room. Blake followed her, and helped her rinse off with soap and water. It sluiced into a drain; the septic tank would need to be emptied in time. Geneva needed to take precautions about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then she walked out of the clinic. In the street, people turned and stared. Some whispered. Others backed away. But more waved and called out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Miss Geneva! Miss Geneva! My &lt;/em&gt;son—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Lizardwoman was waiting for Geneva. One of many. They pushed forwards and Geneva held up a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Please! Don't push. I've told you—keep your distance! Are you washing your hands, Miss Vioneq?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardwoman wrung her clawed hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes—but my son—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll see to him. Stay back. Once I begin treating the patients, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; touch me. Stay back, and keep clean. Remember what I said: the disease is spreading through &lt;em&gt;liquids&lt;/em&gt;, now. Boil your water. Wash your hands regularly. Do not touch your mouth or nose. Or—nose holes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crowd backed up. More called out to Geneva. She walked past them, in her protective leather armor. It was brown, rather than pearly white, but it had one mark of her profession. A red cross, painted on the back, underneath the resin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Last Light of Baleros. That was how they greeted her these days. A sick Lizardboy, with the early stages of the disease. Someone with a high fever and diarrhea—no pus. That only occurred if they had open wounds, thankfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva made her rounds. Her clinic was far, &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; too small for the amount of patients with lesser ailments. But she stopped there, using her Skill, advising the families on what to do. Wash hands, do not allow the disease to spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a disaster. Geneva was making her nightly rounds; she had done them this morning, before Okasha's silly break. And the people were listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Talenqual was a Lizardfolk city. Which meant tightly-packed, social, wood housing that was sprawling rather than vertical except for the richer parts of the city which were built with stone. The exact sort of place a plague loved to spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Geneva was one [Doctor]. Alone. She kept walking, her feet growing tired despite Okasha's best efforts, into the night. She ignored her fatigue. But she had a nursing staff of less than &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt;, with volunteers. She had four suits of the protective equipment made and the rest were delayed for 'real' orders by the [Armorers]. No one was paying attention to this epidemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Except for her. And that had to change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri, the Swedish [Ranger] and member of the Bushrangers found Geneva in the clinic the next day at dawn. Geneva Scala was sitting in a chair, next to the contained petri dish. Snacking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stay past the line."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] pointed. Siri stopped at the yellow line that had been painted on the floor. No one was allowed past except people in protective gear or patients. She saw Geneva bite into a white stick, chew, grimacing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Nali-&lt;/em&gt;sticks? I didn't know you liked them, Geneva."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri indicated the white sticks Geneva was eating. They were concentrated sugar, the kind that gave you an insane rush of energy. So sweet they were addictive. The [Doctor] glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're right. I don't like it that much. It's far too sweet, even by our standards of candy. But it's quick energy. And…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grimaced. She needed them. And someone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; loved them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Nali, Nali-stick! Gotta have my nali-sticks!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha shouted happily, sharing Geneva's taste buds. It was fascinating how they could taste the same thing, but one mind enjoyed it while the other found it stimulating at best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do you need, Siri? I'm going to meet…Fezimet today. In a few minutes, actually."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's why I'm here. Daly wants me to escort you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri spoke carefully. She saw Geneva's brows snap together. Siri sighed. She shouldn't have mentioned Daly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To make sure no one knocks over the container. To hold open doors."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;And because Ken isn't here and you could say something that &lt;/em&gt;upsets&lt;em&gt; him.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha whispered into Geneva's head. The [Doctor] scowled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wouldn't say anything that offends Fezimet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I didn't say that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri blinked a few times. Geneva hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. Okasha, not you. Fine. Come on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She yawned, stretching. Then Geneva knocked over the quill she'd been using to write notes on all her patients. She bent down, grabbing for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And effortlessly reached down from an upright position. Touched the ground, scooped up the quill, and stood back up. All without her body protesting. Geneva and Siri stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wow. You're &lt;em&gt;flexible.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva Scala hesitated. She bent down, touched her toes. Then stood upright. Experimentally, she reached out, pulled her fingers &lt;em&gt;back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They nearly touched her forearm. Geneva bent down, touched her toes, and walked her hands back. She was as flexible as a gymnast. It was—uncanny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hah! So &lt;/em&gt;that's&lt;em&gt; what it does! Hey Geneva, guess what?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You leveled up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I leveled—aw.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid pouted internally. Then she brightened up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"That's right! I have a Skill, which means it affects &lt;/em&gt;you! &lt;em&gt;[Physical Enhancement: Flexibility]. See? Look!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached out with Geneva's left arm. Siri blanched as the arm &lt;em&gt;rotated&lt;/em&gt; nearly a hundred and eighty degrees, moving &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; further than it should normally. Geneva felt the strain, but her fingers were waggling, demonstrating insane dexterity. She wasn't made of rubber, but she had the kind of flexibility that only occurred in a very few amount of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What…is that? Geneva?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Flexibility. Okasha leveled up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri responded faintly. Geneva frowned. This could be useful. It was also disturbing, but it would help with surgeries. That was her main concern. She frowned as Okasha made her scratch that itch on her back that normal Geneva had never reached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"When did you level up, Okasha?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Five hours ago. I went to sleep. &lt;/em&gt;You &lt;em&gt;didn't even notice. You were controlling me for a bit. Creepy. Good thing I have that Skill that lets you move even when I'm not awake."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. How many Skills does that make?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Um…one, two…five? Nice skill, huh? We can probably do all kinds of weird maneuvers now! I can't wait to try it out! Let me try, please, please?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. It's a useful Skill, though. It'd have been better if it was a Skill to reduce my fatigue so I can work longer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha sighed as Siri backed away from the one-sided conversation, for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I'm only Level 11, Geneva. You want a refreshment Skill? Wait until I get to Level 20, at least! But I'm leveling up quick, huh?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yes. Very quickly. Geneva blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're Level 11? I thought you were Level 4 when—never mind. We have to get to that meeting. Siri, I'm grabbing the container. Grab two of the masks. The oversized one is for Fezimet. I'd bring armor, but apparently that's an 'insult'. And the gloves."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She walked out of the clinic. Okasha was audibly disappointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Come on, let's try something out! Isn't it cool? First the box at Level 10, now this! I might be the first Selphid in living memory to have this class! It's nothing like the old stories!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva marched out of her clinic. She stared at the rising sun. She must have been awake all night. Again. But she'd gotten to her patients. That was what mattered. Anyways, she had [Lesser Endurance] now. That cut down on the fatigue. She was leveling too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What old stories, Okasha? And keep silent when we get to Fezimet's tower. I need to focus."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha sighed. And her voice was a bit…bitter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You never listen. I told you twice. And when I leveled up! You didn't even let me eat cake for the Level 10 celebration. It's always work, work, work with you…you need rest, Geneva!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Fine. This is important. But promise me you'll lie down? I'm looking at your body and it looks worse! Also, you need to poo. Nice, healthy poo. Nothing like that Yellow Rivers stuff. Disgusting—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Okasha!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Fine. I'm shutting up. Congratulations, Okasha! I'm only a Level 11 [Inner Friend]. Odd, though. The old stories never have this class. It was always…[Controller]. [Dominator]. [Overlord]. This is strange. But we're friends so that's why. Right Geneva? Geneva?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Commander Fezimet—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Glorious&lt;/em&gt; Fezimet, please, Miss Scala. I'm joking. Call me whatever you like! Am I joking? I probably am."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Quexal rose to his full height, his feathered wings resplendent. Geneva sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Glorious Fezimet—you have to understand. This plague is spreading &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. When I say a lockdown of the city is necessary, I mean it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For two weeks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Quexal stared at Geneva, and stopped showing off his wings. She and Siri were in his office. He stared at the two Humans. Both were wearing Geneva's masks and gloves. She had the petri dish with the Yellow Rivers sample on his desk. He had refused the mask. He didn't have hands so much as talons halfway up his body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Quexal, one of the rare evolutions of Lizardfolk, was powerful. Huge, sinuous—an imposing form. And he could jump and &lt;em&gt;glide.&lt;/em&gt; He was radiant, and knew it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva didn't care. She had been talking to the leader of the Featherfolk Brigade, who ruled this city as the company in charge, and she was running out of patience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At least two weeks. No entry into the city, or exit. Via port or otherwise. I need [Healers] to help me tend to the patients, more protective armor—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All of which my company pays for. Because of a few cases of this Yellow Rivers stuff? I admit, it's nasty. And I am &lt;em&gt;honored&lt;/em&gt; by the Last Light of Baleros tending to people in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; city free of charge."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one missed the emphasis on 'my'. Geneva sighed. Fezimet went on, eying the yellow sample in the dish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it's spread by sex, isn't it? That's not an issue. Yes, there are cases. But your clinic is doing &lt;em&gt;splendidly.&lt;/em&gt; That's why I'm not even charging a tax. Just do more of that, yes? Hm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri broke in, her voice polite as she bowed to the Quexal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm afraid it's not that simple. The disease has &lt;em&gt;mutated&lt;/em&gt;, Glorious Fezimet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Say what now? Done what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The leader of the Featherfolk Brigade paused. Siri tried to explain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mutated. That means it—has changed. It now spreads via more than sex. Anyone who touches the pus—that sample, sir—can catch the virus."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bacteria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva whispered. Siri shrugged. Fezimet instantly recoiled and backed up towards his glass windows overseeing his city. The tower in which his company resided was the tallest by far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Touch it?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And have it enter their mucus glands. Mouth, nostrils—ears—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Quexal relaxed a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Then just don't touch those places. Miss Scala, I appreciate the concern. But we have less than a hundred cases in the entire city! It is not an—what did you call it? An 'epidemamy'?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Epidemy. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a plague, Commander Fezimet. And it is already &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Talenqual and other cities. The reason the numbers are low is because no one is looking for the disease! But for me!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Quexal made a polite sound as he flicked his tail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And yet—people recover."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In one to two weeks. I can speed recovery to one week if I attend to them personally. But in the meantime, they have fever, they discharge mucus and pus, have diarrhea—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, yes. Please, I haven't had breakfast yet. So what? It goes away in a week. &lt;em&gt;Ideal!&lt;/em&gt; This isn't as bad as the &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; plagues. Believe me, I lived through the Petriplague when I was a hatchling. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; killed. This goes away!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Quexal cut Geneva off, looking disgusted. Geneva inhaled a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's true. This isn't nearly as virulent as most strains. It could be far, far worse. But the potential is that this disease mutates again, Glorious Fezimet. To kill its hosts. And the issue isn't that people recover. It's that it spreads &lt;em&gt;fast.&lt;/em&gt; If it gets into a household, the odds are about 61% that they all become ill. Yes, the level of infection varies; a [Warrior]'s body fights off the plague far better than a normal civilian's. However…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Siri winced. Fezimet's eyes were glazing over as Geneva began to use statistics. He got the danger. He just thought it didn't matter. People &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; getting better. Geneva's clinic had had only a handful of deaths. And people did get well in two weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva. I think it's time for the demonstration."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Swedish girl whispered to the [Doctor]. Geneva looked at her, realized she was right, and grimaced. She'd done so much work in the thinking box analyzing the numbers available to her. She had a &lt;em&gt;graph&lt;/em&gt; and a map of the city's infectious hotspots, but the Quexal didn't care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Glorious Commander Fezimet, I have a demonstration for you. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the real danger of the Yellow Rivers disease and why I fear that if we reach a critical point, the plague will spread to &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt;, not just hundreds. It's already going across the sea; I treated a crew with six infected members. You have a chance to stop it in Talenqual. Because this is the real danger of the sickness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She opened the glass box. And then removed the petri dish. Fezimet eyed the bacteria with disgust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Disgusting. But if I wash my…claws, it doesn't infect me, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It might. Thorough washing is essential, Commander Fezimet. But please, observe. Would you consider putting on the helmet?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, but go ahead."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was just a bit of the culture, in the center of the dish. The yellow blob glistened as Fezimet put a feathered wing over his face. Siri gagged at the smell too. Geneva produced something. A vial. Geneva also pulled out a crude dropper and filled it with some of the potion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is a single drop of healing potion, Commander. Please observe what happens if it interacts with the bacteria—the Yellow Rivers disease."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She poised the dropper over the dish. And a glistening drop of the potion fell onto the dish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A single drop of a weak healing potion landed. It splashed and then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The yellow rot instantly covered the entire petri dish. Siri recoiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Jävla skit!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dead gods!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So did Fezimet. They backed up as the Yellow Rivers bacteria multiplied insanely quickly. The audience watched as Geneva closed the petri dish and put it into the container. Then she folded her hands behind her back and looked at Fezimet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The first reaction of every person and [Healer] is to use a healing potion. And when that happens, a small infection turns into an open sore. And it turns a preventable illness into full-blown fever, diarrhea, and pus from the sores which infects &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who doesn't wash their hands thoroughly before touching a mucus membrane. Healing potions will turn minor victims who don't know they've been infected into people on their deathbeds. I must &lt;em&gt;insist&lt;/em&gt; you put out an announcement and lock down the city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked Fezimet in the eye. And to his credit, the Quexal blanched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can't have that in our [Warriors]! Why didn't you &lt;em&gt;lead&lt;/em&gt; with that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He meant his company's fighting power. Geneva exhaled and Siri shuffled her feet. The [Doctor] opened her mouth for a response and Okasha pulled it closed. She felt the Selphid take over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm terribly sorry, oh Glorious Fezimet. You have lovely plumage today, by the way. But I was concerned for civilian matters. I am not a commander."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva-Okasha bowed, smiling politely. Fezimet blinked a few times, and then relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I can't expect a&lt;em&gt; [Doctor]&lt;/em&gt; to understand military matters. I see the issue. Yes—you'll have an announcement. We'll do it later today!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] in question exhaled slowly in relief. She closed her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And the lockdown?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fezimet smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Obviously, that's a bit too far. But I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; order the [Healers] in the city to take orders from you. I think that's the best compromise. Don't you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva's head snapped up. And Okasha was too slow this time to stop her retort. Siri covered her face with one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a small illness running through our city. And other cities! It's known as the Yellow Rivers disease—and apparently, it spreads through the horrible pus. Not just sex. We have the situation &lt;em&gt;under control,&lt;/em&gt; but there are precautions we need to take. Now, I have The Last Light of Baleros here to speak about it. Miss Scala?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly saw Geneva standing on the podium in front of the crowd. He saw the [Doctor] arranging her notes. Talenqual's citizens were staring up at her and Fezimet in the announcement square.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look happy. She'd protested Fezimet wanting to &lt;em&gt;gather&lt;/em&gt; people with an infectious disease running rampant. She didn't like his wording, either, as her tone made clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…The Yellow Rivers disease is a growing epidemic in Baleros. It may already be travelling to other major ports in the world. It spreads via sex—or any contact with the infected pus or other liquids to orifices. That means nostrils, mouths—anyone can get it. Using a healing potion will only make the disease &lt;em&gt;worse.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crowd murmured. Geneva went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It can be prevented."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely it can! And anyone who is ill should visit Miss Scala's clinic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fezimet slithered forwards to shout reassuringly. Geneva glared at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…But I am convinced this disease is &lt;em&gt;already present&lt;/em&gt; in multiple cities. And spreading through red light districts. Brothels, and then from person to person. To remain safe, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; wash your hands or claws with soap before eating. Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; touch your face, eyes, mouth, if you can avoid it. If you think someone is ill—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shit. She looks exhausted. When does she sleep?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Daly cursed as he and Edima looked up at Geneva. She was indeed pale, and there were rings around her eyes. The Dullahan looked worriedly at Daly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How bad is this disease, Daly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At the moment? Bad. According to Geneva, it'll get worse. At least Fezimet's giving her control of the [Healers]. They can't use healing potions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Which was entirely the problem. No one in Talenqual was happy with the pronouncement. The people looked to Geneva, the Last Light of Baleros as a source of reassurance, but the [Healers] weren't so sanguine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If we cannot &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; if someone is infected, what do we do? If a Centaur is lying on the ground, with a broken leg—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Set the bone, clean the wound, and let them heal &lt;em&gt;naturally.&lt;/em&gt; Use anything but magic!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva snapped back. Thirty minutes after her speech—which had taken thirty minutes of repeating instructions about how to contain the Yellow Rivers disease—she was arguing with the [Healers]. They looked discontent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But that will take &lt;em&gt;months!&lt;/em&gt; Without a potion—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even a drop makes the infection worse. Do a drop test first. If the potion has no visible effects, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; infected. And they have to be quarantined—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And what about the broken leg? So they're sick with a broken leg and ill? And we can't use a potion? Surely there's some medicine. I hear someone had wonderful success with a poultice of Sage's Grass and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It doesn't work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva snapped at the Lizardwoman [Healer]. The woman looked affronted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How do you know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've &lt;em&gt;tested &lt;/em&gt;it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, my friend says it worked on—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work. Nothing works on this disease so far except keeping your patients hydrated, clean, and rested! There &lt;em&gt;is no magical cure.&lt;/em&gt; A poultice will only make things worse or do nothing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Healers] murmured, discontent, doubting. Geneva scowled at them. Idiots! They relied on magic. They didn't know the first thing about germ theory. She saw one of them raise a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay, I understand not poultices and potions. But I have some lovely magical crystals that—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] slammed her hands on the table. The [Healers] fell silent. Geneva Scala breathed in, slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There is only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way to treat this illness. Listen closely. If you suspect someone of being sick, perform a drop test with a healing potion. Only then—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some people listened. All the [Midwives] Geneva talked to were much more receptive than the [Healers]. They promised to take care—&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if the mother was in childbirth. They'd call for her to operate without potions if need be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Yellow Rivers disease was spreading. Geneva saw the signs everywhere. Closed brothels, or ones operating and &lt;em&gt;advertising&lt;/em&gt; the condoms and that they'd been checked by &lt;em&gt;The Last Light&lt;/em&gt;. The plague hadn't spread yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was going to. That was how it worked. That was what 'exponential' meant. Only, who knew that word in this world? And it was going from port to port since Fezimet wouldn't close Talenqual, let alone the other cities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We need a cure. I'm sorry, but I need you all to pull longer shifts. I've got some more volunteers—[Midwives], more of our company. But I need to come up with a cure. Fezimet has —graciously—ordered some of the lower-level [Alchemists] to find a penicillin substitute. But making sure it works without serious side-effects will take time. I need to split my attention between testing and the clinic. I will come here every day, but you will all be in charge."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva gave a speech to her [Nurses]. All nine of them stood in front of her as she stood. Somewhat unsteady. They nodded seriously. Geneva wobbled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, sincerely, for everything. Anyone not working can go rest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That came from Okasha. Geneva sat down as the others filed out. The clinic had six more cots in it. And Geneva had just paid for the building next to it—a shop—to expand her business. The owner had sold her the rights. The [Shopkeeper] had been terrified of the illness anyways and Fezimet had 'insisted'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva was too tired to worry about the ethics. They needed the room. She sat down. Was the world…spinning? She only realized someone was talking into her head after a few seconds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Geneva, you're been in charge and awake for nearly nineteen hours! Give me a turn. You're exhausting yourself again! There's all this &lt;/em&gt;ick&lt;em&gt; in your system—you keep trying to make too much stomach acid as well! You need to rest. It's been over a day since we slept!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha was worried. Geneva jerked upright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm—fine. It's not your time off, Okasha. We don't have time for that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I didn't ask for that. I just said—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My Skills are nearly recharged, Okasha. I'm doing the rounds. I can rest afterwards."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva got up. She looked around, muzzily. Maybe it was time to sleep? She'd use her Skill, then walk to the company, sleep for six hours. Four? That should do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was just getting up when she heard a commotion outside the clinic. Geneva poked her head outside. And she saw a crowd of infected people arguing with Aiko.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let us in! We need The Last Light's help!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Centaur was arguing with Aiko, pointing at an infected sore on his arm. He wasn't badly off; nor were the others. Geneva recognized some of them. They all had minor symptoms. Aiko was trying to bar the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We cannot take you all! Geneva will see you! Please—hello, please wait! We cannot—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You can't not treat us!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone called out. Geneva was hurrying towards them when it happened. Someone &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt; Aiko out of the way. She went down with a cry. Geneva heard her glass mask &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aiko!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Blake saw and rushed forwards. But the crowd of patients rushed forwards, going for Geneva. She shouted. Aiko was being trampled! They were—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Two hours later. Geneva Scala was still awake. She looked down at Aiko.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman had cuts on her face from the broken glass mask. The clinic was being expanded next door; Geneva heard one of the [Builders] begin to knock the wall in. She sat, feeling Aiko's head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Despite the glass shards which Geneva had been forced to pull out manually—without painkillers—Aiko's face wasn't healed. No healing potion had been used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had a fever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our suits didn't work properly. Or she was infected when she was trampled."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was Blake's conclusion. Geneva just shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The incubation isn't that fast. We didn't use a potion; she was already sick. The suits aren't perfect. We knew it was a risk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're not sick. And you've treated the most people."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have a resistance Skill. But I'm at risk, still. So is anyone else. Let the staff know. Aiko will be under my care. It's early-stages; she wasn't badly hurt. She will be fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva looked up. Blake looked at the cuts on Aiko's face. The Yellows River bacteria ate away at open wounds. He hesitated, and then adjusted the glass mask on his face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll let the others know. I'm staying."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva just sat there. Looking at her friend. Aiko had been the first [Nurse]. Now, she was breathing heavily as sweat beaded on her forehead. Geneva had administered a sleeping agent; she had that at least.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Everyone, stay back! If you are sick, you have to take care of yourself! Anyone with serious symptoms will be treated! Do not approach!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice bellowed from outside. Geneva looked up. It was Daly's voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bushrangers were standing outside of the clinic. They had arrived to break up the mob and were now standing guard. They had their crossbows out and loaded. To get the others off them, Daly had shot one of the sick patients through the leg and his team had used force to pull the others off her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was standing outside when Geneva exited the clinic. She looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Daly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How's Aiko?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned to her, worry in his eyes. Geneva shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Her wounds aren't serious. I've applied my Skill; the cuts may scab over before…the bacteria begins to mortify the wounds. Why are the Bushrangers here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As security. Fezimet will send some of his [Guards] tomorrow. We're here tonight. We'll trade off in shifts."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva stared at the crossbow the Australian man was holding. A bolt was loaded, although the safety was on. Daly saw her look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Desperate people, Geneva. We won't fire if we don't have to, but people need to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He hesitated as he met the [Doctor]'s gaze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know you don't like the idea. But sometimes [Doctors] need people to guard their backs. Or manage difficult patients, idiots, and so forth."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at him. And her temper boiled over. She was tired. And Daly had injured one of the ill people badly enough that they were now in one of the new cots. She leaned forwards and hissed at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And what is the &lt;em&gt;powder&lt;/em&gt; for?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The adventurer's eyes flickered. He looked at Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If the idiots bring War Walkers. There are some people who'd slaughter saints, Geneva. You know that. Look—let's not talk about it now. You need rest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not yet. Don't touch me. You'll get infected."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva jerked back. Her protective armor moved as she walked back inside the clinic. She was sweating too, from the heat. She sat back next to Aiko. And kept working, ignoring the voice in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Stop. You're not well, Geneva."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three more hours later, Geneva was checking patients at the door to her clinic as the Bushrangers admitted them one by one. Okasha was pleading with her. Geneva had stopped listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Next!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A young woman said something outside. There were complaints, but the Bushrangers didn't let anyone in. A woman came from the side, through the clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I said, no one enters that way—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva shot to her feet, angry. She saw Paige, without the protective gear, standing in the center of the clinic. She didn't approach Geneva, who had some of the infectious material on her armor. Geneva opened her mouth, but someone else spoke for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Paige! Talk some sense into Geneva!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was Okasha. Geneva closed her mouth with a snap. Paige nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going to do just that, Okasha. Geneva—you need to sleep. You're dead on your feet and you're compromising your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; systems."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll rest…later. I need to keep checking people. Keep them calm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Paige exhaled slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let one of us take over. We can at least repeat what you told them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I have the Skills. I can manage it. I'll take a stamina potion."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva shook her head a few times. Paige opened and closed her mouth. And then the [Engineer] glared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva, let one of us &lt;em&gt;take over.&lt;/em&gt; Rest! You know, we can help too. We might not be [Doctors], but if you tell us what to do, we can try. You don't have to stop the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; Yellow Rivers plague on your own. You don't have to be the actual Last Light of Baleros."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor]'s head jerked back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I never said that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, but you act like it. We're not idiots. We can take over. You need. To. Sleep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not yet. There are patients waiting outside. I'll—set up a second inspection station. But put some gear on! Training someone to always be here is a good idea. But give me two more hours. I can use my Skill on Aiko again…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva began to turn back to call for someone else. She &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to keep working. This was a crucial moment. Sleep? She could sleep once people were calm. Once Aiko was stable. She could not lose anyone. She—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Something was wrong. Geneva wasn't moving. She tried—and realized her body had locked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha? Something's wrong."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Paige is right, Geneva. You need to sleep. I can't let you do this to yourself.&lt;/em&gt; We're going to bed, Paige."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva got up and began to walk to the changing room. The [Doctor] spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, we're not. Stop that. Okasha? &lt;em&gt;Okasha.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice whispered in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I'm putting you in the box. This is for your own good."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva shouted, but it was internally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Don't you dare, Okasha! No! Don't you d—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Doctor Level 34!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Skill – Disease Detector obtained!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva woke up with a start. She looked around, saw daylight shining into her room. Only—the sun had gone &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt; in the sky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;How long had she slept? The [Doctor] began to scramble out of bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha! What did you do? &lt;em&gt;What did you do?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She shouted. There was a yawn in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Morning, Geneva. We were asleep. Wow, is it tomorrow? We must have slept for over—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman shot out of her bed. She looked around wildly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You put me to &lt;em&gt;sleep? &lt;/em&gt;What did you do when I was out?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid's voice was defensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Nothing! You just went to sleep. That's all. I told you, you were being unhealthy. But you didn't listen."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Never do that again! You have no right when I have patients that need tending to!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Italian woman snapped. She looked around. She was in her underwear. Okasha had changed her clothes, put her in her private room. Geneva began to reach for her clothes, tug them on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hey! I'm living here too! Your body was &lt;/em&gt;failing&lt;em&gt;, Geneva. You need to sleep. I can't keep doing this. Don't ignore me! We need to work together, okay? You leveled up, didn't you? I bet you did! Geneva!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] was cursing. She had to get to her clinic, check on Aiko! She reached for her socks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And her hand wouldn't move. Geneva Scala froze. Then she sat back and sighed. Her mouth moved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid replied with Geneva's voice, altering it slightly. Geneva had to wait for her to finish to respond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop taking control of me. I have to go to work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh yeah? Well, perhaps you could thank me for looking out for you? I have to help too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—thank you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. And agree that you need &lt;em&gt;sleep.&lt;/em&gt; Every fourteen hours. Agreed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If there's a patient—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Let the nurses handle it! &lt;/em&gt;Or a [Healer]! But that's the rule. Understand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—can't agree to that. I've sworn an oath."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva's hand rose and jabbed herself in the chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, that oath doesn't involve killing yourself. Those are the rules. If you don't agree, we can sit here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman's mouth moved for a while. But she didn't move. At last, she spoke in a strangled voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine. I agree."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good! Then we can go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva didn't move. After a second, the [Doctor] spoke again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where's my 'thank you'?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Thank you. Please let me go to work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"See? Was that so &lt;em&gt;hard?&lt;/em&gt; You can be polite! And so can I!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The body began to move as Geneva willed it. Slowly, she reached for her socks. Okasha went on, inside her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You don't appreciate me. I'd just like to be &lt;/em&gt;thanked&lt;em&gt; for the hard work I do. Is that so much to ask? I should have veto rights as well."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it's my body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva replied slowly. Okasha's pause was long. Geneva's mouth moved as the Selphid replied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Yellow Rivers disease landed in First Landing, Lailight Scintillation, and two Terandrian ports in three more days. Geneva knew because she was listening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Or rather, Okasha was. The Selphid listened to gossip during her four hours off. Which now occurred every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had negotiated. Okasha had stopped the bargaining on that point. Four hours, each day was 'her time'. Of course, she let Geneva make suggestions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And all ten hours Geneva got before they had their mandated sleep was spent at work. The plague was moving faster, so she was at her clinic, consulting other [Healers]…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Talenqual was not part of any of the Four Companies' lands. It was, like many areas, under a company's control, but semi-autonomous. Oh, it had treaties with larger companies, but it was ruled by Fezimet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the illness had hit this region of Baleros. Now, it was spreading by sea. And land. More cases were appearing in other cities and after incubating in brothels, it had begun to do exactly what this kind of epidemic—no, a true pandemic now—did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Spread faster and faster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The list of Geneva's patients had been under a hundred people a few days ago. Now it was over three hundred. The [Doctor] was meeting with Fezimet again, to reassure him the situation was still under control. He was still considering a lockdown, but had told Geneva he preferred another city to do it first. It was 'bad for trade'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva Scala was writing a letter to a [Healer] in a neighboring city, Bolandus. The Dullahan [Mayor] there was a lot more alarmed than Fezimet had been and had reached out via the best [Healer], who was Level 37, to Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had some good ideas. Healing crystals actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; help fight the bacteria. Mainly by accelerating the body's natural systems and not the bacteria. That had surprised Geneva, but the [Crystal Healer] was also open to all of Geneva's treatment ideas. They were corresponding, trying to create a chamber where the most ill patients could be housed. The problem was simply that there were too many cases and not enough hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I need more [Nurses]. But—the suits aren't working."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva put her head in her hands. Blake was sick now, too. Aiko was recovering, but Geneva had &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; the Yellow Rivers disease in him with her new Skill. And two more of her [Nurses] had early-stage symptoms as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hadn't gotten sick. Because she had resistance Skills. Two of her staff, Priya being one of them, had the [Lesser Resistance: Disease] Skill. But two nurses?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They needed two &lt;em&gt;hundred&lt;/em&gt;. But no one was willing to volunteer outside of the United Nations company. They were afraid of the illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, relax, Geneva. You're doing the best you can. This [Healer] is working hard, and that [Mayor] is listening. And &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; not sick. So—Selphids don't get sick. Hire some Selphid [Nurses]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't think the bacteria can infect you, Okasha. That's true. But there are only a handful of Selphids in Talenqual."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva shook her head. She munched down on a &lt;em&gt;nali­&lt;/em&gt;-stick as her quill glided over the page. Delicious. She chomped it down as Okasha replied. She was a lot more vocal these days. And she demanded to be heard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going to put in five more hours at the clinic after this message, Okasha. And then check on the cultures."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mm. I dunno, Geneva. You seem stressed. I think you should take a break. Hey! Let's visit Xeppal! You can check out the brothel, make sure everyone's healthy…and then we can have some fun."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha replied with Geneva's mouth. She took control of it so they could have a dialogue. Geneva paused and thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—really feel like I need to work, Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I vote against. Your health is important, Geneva."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor]'s heart beat steadily. And her stomach wasn't tied in a knot. Because Okasha was there, blocking those natural reactions. Geneva was calm. And she even grew excited at the thought of meeting Xeppal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva spoke to Okasha. The Selphid stopped. But Geneva was worried. Because she didn't &lt;em&gt;feel &lt;/em&gt;worried. Even that was a biological response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. I really would appreciate it if you let me get to work. This is really important."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A sigh inside her head. Her hand reached for another &lt;em&gt;nali-&lt;/em&gt;stick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you insist, Geneva. I suppose I can let you. But I'm taking five hours tonight. Deal?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Deal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva bit into the &lt;em&gt;nali-&lt;/em&gt;stick, and savored the taste. So sweet. So good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her mouth froze mid-chew. Geneva caught herself reaching for another &lt;em&gt;nali&lt;/em&gt;-stick. Good? When had they started tasting good? They hadn't always tasted like this. Had they…?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. Are my taste buds—different?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No. Even a Selphid couldn't change them. Geneva thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. Did you level up again?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She heard a voice in her head. No—more like a giggle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Maybe. Have another nali-stick.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Geneva did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It reached a head on a good day. A glorious day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Geneva Scala? I have a sum of coins from…the Maelstrom's Howling company. They've sent you gold and they want to know if you'd be willing to travel north. To…visit them and consult about this plague."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The wide-eyed Courier stopped in Geneva's clinic with a letter of credit to the nearest Merchant's Guild. Geneva, who was used to letters from other cities and [Healers] by now, hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maelstrom's Howling? One of the Four Great Companies?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Miss. And you're the Last Light of Baleros, right? My name is Timashi. It's an honor to meet you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Centaur Courier ducked his head. Geneva blinked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wasn't aware people knew about me. And that…title is an exaggeration, Courier Timashi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Centaur tossed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, I know. Names are always like that. But the herds—pardon me—my people talk about you. A Human of honor. You saved my people's lives. More than once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at him. And remembered two Centaurs she had saved, both in times of war. Geneva nodded slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a delight to meet you, Timashi. And—I don't know if I can travel, but I'll think about it. I can certainly correspond. We'll put the gold to good use. Excuse me? Can someone take the…letter? My suit is dirty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can! Excuse me, thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Lizardgirl hurried over in her suit of gear. Geneva nodded gratefully to her. A few more [Nurses] had volunteered since the plague had spread further. Well—the United Nations company was growing. Daly had recruited some more adventurers, even a Drake and Dullahan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you—Miss Ullia?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardgirl bowed slightly as she took the letter carefully. She stared at the Courier and her eyes flicked to Geneva; awe, no doubt at one of the Great Companies making a move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I also have a letter from the Forgotten Wing company. More gold; and an invitation to meet as well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you. As I said, I'm quite busy…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Great Companies named were closest geographically to Talenqual, so it made sense they were worried about the illness. The gold would go to good use; Geneva had expanded her clinic twice. She was planning on an actual hospital. But she needed &lt;em&gt;staff&lt;/em&gt;; she could entice workers who wouldn't volunteer with gold, but she wanted people who would volunteer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My pleasure, Miss Scala. And if you have any deliveries, I'd be happy to take them at a discount."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Courier smiled at her. Geneva smiled back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you. Perhaps we could get a drink tonight? If you're staying in the city?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gave him an admiring look. The Centaur preened slightly as they did under attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—certainly! I could stay the night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll be off work in two hours. Perhaps we could meet at—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva smiled, agreed to meet the Centaur, and bade him farewell. Then she lost her smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What? He's nice. I think he's nice.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid slyly retorted. Geneva crossed her arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We don't have time for this. We—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw Ullia, the Lizardgirl, coming back over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me, Ullia. Can you tend to the patients? I need to…think for a moment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, Doctor Scala."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Umina bowed and watched Geneva retreat into her office. Then she whispered into the little short-range speaking stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Marian! &lt;em&gt;Marian! &lt;/em&gt;Maelstrom's Howling is making moves! The Professor was right!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The voice came back, frantic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know! Dead gods! I thought this was just a lesson, but maybe the Professor sent Kissilt and Cameral because he thought we needed backup! I'm trying to investigate—I'm going to be pulling these Bushrangers around! I'll tell Kissilt not to break our cover. That fathead nearly gave it all away when he saw me! Just keep observing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardgirl nodded. She saw Geneva close the door to her office, but she hadn't figured out how to tap the office yet. Nor had she figured out how to convince Geneva that she wanted to meet the Titan of Baleros. But she would.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inside the office, Geneva Scala sat down. She spoke, very slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. I do not want to get into a relationship with Timashi. Even for a night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But I do. What if we flip for it? Huh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] produced a coin. Geneva shook her head. Her voice was quiet. But she had to say it. It was time to say—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. I am not comfortable with being with Timashi. Even if it is 'your time'. I am not—willing to do this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it's our body, Geneva."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha's voice was reasonable. Friendly. Geneva began to shiver. And stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. I think it's time to talk about our relationship. This is my body. I'm grateful for everything you've done to help me. But—this is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; body. Do you understand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was only silence for a second. Geneva tried to move. But then—she began to chuckle. And then laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] threw her head back. And she stood up and laughed, spreading her arms as she looked at herself in the little mirror on her desk. And Okasha laughed at Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva. You mean, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; body, don't you? Let's talk. I was thinking it was about time too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she kept laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Umina listened to the [Doctor] laughing in her office. And she had no idea why. At the gold? That could make anyone laugh. Umina's eyes had popped when she saw the donations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this laughter was different. And the [Doctor] was—talking to herself? Umina saw her sit down behind the closed shades. She began to edge closer, to listen, looking around to see if the other [Nurses] or patients were watching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then the speaking stone chirped. Marian's voice came through, frantic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Umina! Umina! &lt;/em&gt;Another huge development! Can you get out of the clinic? You have to see this!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardgirl clapped a claw over the speaking stone, looking around. Marian shouted back; she was galloping towards something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're not going to &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; this—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva, Okasha, sat in her chair. And she looked at herself. She smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, Geneva. You never appreciated me. Not once. No 'thank you, Okasha'. No appreciation for the hard work I do. And you know what? It's &lt;em&gt;hard work.&lt;/em&gt; When you drink like a [Sailor], who manages your liver? When you overwork, who takes care of your muscles? Maintains your body? Me. And you just don't know how hard it is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva looked at Okasha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. I'm—thoughtless."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh? Like the thirty-hour work sessions where I &lt;em&gt;beg&lt;/em&gt; you to rest? And you don't listen? Me, stuck in here for months before you let me have a few hours to be myself? I can't leave because &lt;em&gt;you're&lt;/em&gt; paralyzed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha snapped back, poking at the mirror. She took a few breaths, luxuriating in the feeling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—it's okay. I like you, Geneva. I really do. You're so—caring. But you can't take care of yourself. That's what I've learned. You &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; me. It was a good thing we came together."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That I was paralyzed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Italian woman's eyes were locked on herself, unblinking. She saw her lips curve upwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not &lt;em&gt;that.&lt;/em&gt; But it all worked out. So—yes. Let's talk about our relationship. You know, it's always been you, you, &lt;em&gt;you. &lt;/em&gt;Not enough me. So I think it would be good if we were finally &lt;em&gt;equals.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have to work. Okasha, my patients need me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid's gaze turned into a snarl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Always your patients!&lt;/em&gt; I'm sick of it! You're just a…one of those &lt;em&gt;machines&lt;/em&gt; you tell me about. You work for everyone else. There's no Geneva. &lt;em&gt;Geneva&lt;/em&gt; would die for them. That's not living. You're sick, Geneva. You're in love with your image. 'The Last Light of Baleros'. I'll let you help people. But I'm drawing a line."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can't do that. This is my body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Our body! I help you move! You can't do anything without me! This is our body!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha's voice rose. Geneva saw, out of the corner of her eye, the Lizardgirl hurrying out of the clinic. She felt herself stand, pace back and forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is my body, Okasha. I was born with it. Doesn't that give me the right to choose?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; in here. You're a terrible roommate, Geneva. And I'm putting my foot down."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And if I disagree how my body is being used? What will you do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid fell silent. She looked at herself. And then she shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva. We're in this together. You can disagree. But you'll see my point eventually. After all—I'm your [Inner Friend]. What are you going to do to—stop me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Silence. After a moment, Geneva spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha. You sound like a tyrant. Are we friends? Or is this relationship one-sided?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw her eyes narrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tyrant?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I just meant—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, I see how it is. You want me to leave? You want to not be able to &lt;em&gt;move?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm doing this for &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, Geneva. We're one person. And you will see it my way. I'm putting you in the box."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha—please—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva's consciousness winked out. She was in [The Thinking Room]. She saw through her eyes. And Okasha's voice whispered through her mouth. Affectionately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going to have a &lt;em&gt;lovely&lt;/em&gt; time with Timashi, and I'm going to &lt;em&gt;eat&lt;/em&gt; and depending on what happens afterwards—&lt;em&gt;we're&lt;/em&gt; going to relax for a few hours. I'll let you come along if you're good. And then we'll discuss how we share our body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"No. Okasha. This isn't friendship. This is control! Okasha!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva shouted. But her body began to move. Geneva Scala, walked out of her office. She smiled and told the [Nurse] she'd be off-duty for the rest of the day. She went into the changing room, cleaned her armor, left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was perfectly Geneva. Okasha could mimic Geneva's movements, her voice. But it wasn't Geneva behind those eyes. She tried to push. Get free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she was in the box. And as Okasha left the clinic, she produced a &lt;em&gt;nali&lt;/em&gt;-stick. Bit into it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yum.&lt;/em&gt; Taste that, Geneva? You see it my way. You'll see. I'll show you how to live."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It tasted good to Geneva as well. The [Doctor] saw Okasha, helplessly experienced the same. Okasha walked down the street, almost skipping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she nearly ran into the group walking towards her. Okasha's head turned. Geneva saw her blink. And then focused on a marching column of…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Folk. Pale-skinned. Dullahans, Lizardfolk, Humans—only one Centaur. And they were—staring at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha froze. And Geneva saw the pale skin, the telltale signs of dead bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Selphids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a Selphid leading them. One both Geneva and Okasha knew. Calectus, the [Honor Guard] they had parted ways with. He looked at Okasha-Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Geneva Scala. We have come to give you aid."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—Calectus. I mean—it is good to see you again. Why are all of—these Selphids here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha squeaked. She looked at the Selphids. There were over two hundred behind Calectus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid dropped to one knee. And Okasha saw many of the Selphids were wearing fresh bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some are members of our company. But many are young. They will be [Doctors], if you will teach them, Geneva Scala. They will help manage this plague. Selphids do not grow ill from most disease. And we hope you will help us in turn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured at the waiting Selphids. And Geneva saw the members of the Featherfolk Brigade shifting uneasily as they guarded the clinic. They looked at Calectus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What company are you from, Calectus?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha pretended ignorance. The Selphid gave her a long look, and then a smile. He gestured to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"None other than the Selphid-only company, The Bodies of Fellden."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bodies of Fellden.&lt;/em&gt; The largest Selphid company in Baleros. Umina saw Marian watching from the background. In his tower, Fezimet grew a bit worried. Even if it was only a hundred and most aspiring apprentice [Doctors] and aid workers—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Here they were. Okasha licked Geneva's lips. Smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I am delighted to see you, Calectus."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed. May we talk? Perhaps in private? We have reserved an inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Helplessly, the Selphid looked around. But the other Selphids were escorting her. And she walked with Calectus as he smiled at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is really pleasant to see you again. Um—Okasha says hi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Doctor] smiled up at the [Honor Guard]. He wore a tall Dullahan's face. Calectus nodded at Geneva, and Geneva felt her heart racing. No—Okasha's heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Okasha. I know. I warned you. You have gone too far."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha's eyes widened. She turned and Calectus laid a gentle hand on her shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;We see you.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Selphids was twisting a ring on her hand. Okasha looked at the Selphid. And wilted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I—please don't?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They led her into the inn, smiling, chattering away. Geneva saw the window closing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha? &lt;em&gt;Let me out. &lt;/em&gt;Okasha?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Turn off her eyes and ears, Okasha. And explain yourself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Okasha began to shake with Geneva's body as six Selphids entered a private room, closing the door. The Selphid [Innkeeper] at the bar bowed them in. They looked at her, eyes full of—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[The Thinking Room] went dark. Geneva sat there, in the silence. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No! No! I'm sorry! Please! Don't punish me!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A scream ran through Geneva. She felt—something—a tugging—and then Okasha was gone. Geneva Scala lay on the floor, breathing in and out. She was lying on her side. She tried to move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Could not. And then she saw something. Calectus, holding a little…jar. And in it was an orange, moving thing. It cried out, in Okasha's voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have committed the sin for which we were destroyed, Okasha. The Minds will sentence you. But we will account for the need. Your…failings will not be unpunished, however. The holding-jar will be your prison for now. It is no less than you deserve."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calectus spoke to the wailing Selphid. Then he turned to Geneva.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our apologies, Miss Scala. We wondered if Okasha had given into the power. I hope we did not arrive too late."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Just in time. Don't hurt her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva whispered. She couldn't move. Calectus nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We are here to help you. And we have much to discuss. But before that—Idis."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Idis?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva saw one of the other Selphids moving out of the corner of her eye. She felt something running down along her spine. Familiar. Calectus looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okasha's replacement."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then Geneva's ears went deaf. She felt something familiar—alien. Running through her. And a voice in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh &lt;em&gt;wow.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva Scala suddenly sat up. She looked around, blinked a few times. Smacked her mouth. And then she grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Calectus! It's me! And it's so &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;! Just like the Minds said! It's even fresher than the newest corpse, and I &lt;em&gt;feel—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She ran her hands down her body, moving every part of her. Then she caught herself, coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me, Miss Scala."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was no box. But Geneva felt/heard the second Selphid speaking through her mouth, overriding her questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello! I'm Idis! Since the other Selphid—Okasha—was trying to take you over, I'll be helping you move! I'm from the Minds—our leaders! They really want to meet you, Miss Geneva. And I'll help you get there and do—whatever needs doing! I'm actually pretty strong, so you can rely on me to kill whoever tries to hurt you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid went on as Geneva tried to speak. She chattered away, testing out other parts of Geneva's body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm a Level 32 [Blademaster]—and a Level 14 [Barbarian]! That's an entire thing, but we're here to help in any way you need! I'll help you move and manage you—like Okasha did. If I don't suit, we have other Selphids who're happy to help out! I won the honor, though. The Minds thought I'd be best. So hello!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Geneva Scala blinked a few times. She raised and lowered her hands, looked at Calectus. The other Selphids looked at her. The [Doctor]. Calectus bowed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have great need of you, Geneva Scala. We would like to learn from you. And help you. Idis will be our link with you. And protector."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;That's right! We can chat later, though. Calectus is bossy. Wow, can you hear me?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Idis laughed in Geneva's head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Amazing! I've never done this. But it's incredible! So much better than a corpse! I really like your body. Is that creepy to say? That's creepy. Anyways—hi! We have so much important stuff to do. Together, I mean."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She waved at herself. Geneva looked at the crying Selphid in the jar. She looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Help was here. Geneva looked around at the other Selphids in their dead bodies, the wailing little Selphid in the jar. People willing to help, aid workers who could replace their bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At last, there was aid. Reinforcements. Military strength and people willing to learn from Geneva. Money, recognition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everything the [Doctor] wanted. Faced with it all, Geneva Scala smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; wasn't the one doing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">497302</guid><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 19:09:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - 7.21 KQ</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/495659</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was so hot. A burning, all-consuming heat. Teresa Atwood gulped water, but it did little to quench her thirst. She felt as if she couldn't cool down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her blood was racing. And her heart wouldn't calm down. The young woman kept drinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then she threw up. The water she'd gulped down so fast came up as her stomach, unprepared, decided it didn't need the hydration. Teresa gasped and spat, and leaned over the side of her horse to do so. But she didn't stop moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Teres! Are you alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An alarmed voice called out. Teresa turned her head and vaguely saw someone riding towards her. A man with only one half. Death Commander Ytol of the Rustängmarder came towards Teres, balancing despite his lack of limbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm—fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teresa realized she was slowing. [Riders] rode past her, as Ytol inspected Teres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Too much water, too quickly. Are you fit to ride?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teres wanted to splash some water on her face, despite the waste. She needed to—just a bit. She cupped a palmful of water into one hand and splashed it onto her face. She was licking at her lips when she tasted the blood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ytol looked gravely at Teres as she recoiled. Then—she saw the water running down her face. It was red and dark. With blood and grime. Teres brushed at her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman stared at her hand. It was red. A bit of flesh had come away. Not hers. Her stomach—moved. But only because she'd drunk more water. The sight of someone else's blood was just numbing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Atwood. We must keep moving. If you are unwell, please fall back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Death Commander spoke, not unkindly. Just briskly. Teres looked at him. The leader of the company of the Rustängmarder paid no attention to the blood. And she—just stared at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She knew it was wrong. But Teres didn't cry, or weep, or wonder whose blood it was. She had the first time she'd killed someone with a sword. After the battle at Reim—Trey used magic, but Teres had been taught the sword. She'd felt the times she killed someone. And they had haunted her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They still did. But she didn't dream any longer. She just rose, rode her horse, and fought. And this last battle had been the sixth major engagement she had ever taken part in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Realm of Jecrass. Teresa Atwood turned her head and saw parts of it burning. Across Belchan's border, the King of Destruction's armies had set the grasslands ablaze. But the River Wardens were fighting the fires. And while Flos Reimarch's forces had marched on Jecrass, they had been halted at the border.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rather—both sides had withdrawn after tearing each other to pieces. Jecrass had gotten the worst of it. But they had more soldiers to throw into the conflict.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they had refused to give ground. Even in the face of Mars and Flos Reimarch—they'd held to the point of slaughter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For one man. King Raelt Leysars, the [King of Challenges]. Also known as the 'King of Duels', as he'd been dubbed. Now, Jecrass fought for their [King], against Reim. And the incredible part was—they were holding the King of Destruction at bay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's wrong with Teres?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another voice. Teres looked up and saw someone galloping back towards her. Mars, the King's Champion, the famous [Vanguard], didn't look tired. But she'd fought without rest during the battle. She must have killed hundreds. Perhaps over a thousand soldiers by herself. Her armor was red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And despite it all, they were retreating. Pulling back. Teres wobbled as Ytol turned towards her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Teres is feeling the fatigue of battle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I got it. Teres, come on. Ride on my horse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can ride."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teres protested. She clutched the mare's reins. She liked her horse. She'd named her Frecklehooves, because of the white-yellow hair around her legs. Flos had been offended at the name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then ride with me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Again, Mars wasn't unkind. Just—insistent. Teres nodded and dug her heels in. Her horse followed Mars, mostly without Teres' help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"His Majesty insists we get back to Sadomere by nightfall. Sadovere? Sadere? I don't know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mars was speaking to Ytol. The Death Commander nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sadomere, Lady Mars. Is the city fortified for our defense?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It had damn well better be."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all the [Vanguard] said. Her voice was terse. Teres found herself looking at Mars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We gave Jecrass a beating. I think it was that General—Lael? We beat her in the field. Shame I couldn't get her. Those damn [Trick Riders]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spurring their horses across the field, leaping over enemy [Soldiers]. Cut down, a few—but weaving, throwing ropes. Trying to drag Mars the Illusionist off her feet. She was strong—she yanked back and pulled one rider and their horse into the dust. But the rest were throwing nets, ropes, even creating illusions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stalling her advance, until Ytol ordered Mars to attack the enemy infantry rather than wasting time with the cavalry. Teres saw the King of Destruction ordering another charge. She plunged into the chaos, following him as the Rustängmarder warded the King of Destruction. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teresa Atwood saw a face as she rode through an unguarded flank. She swung her sword down and felt another woman die—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—might be in trouble. Depends on how well Sadomere is fortified. Flos hasn't ordered for reinforcements, but even defending…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mars was speaking quietly to Ytol. Teres looked up. Ytol was nodding, glancing at the marching Rustängmarder. They were moving fast; their numbers hadn't been largely depleted. The army as a whole…had. They had left over ten thousand dead behind. The enemy—four times that number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A bloody damn battle. Those Jecrass soldiers won't retreat even when I charge them. They must love their [King]. Damn, damn. I hate when his Majesty's right. 'An honorable man'. Pah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mars spat. Teres looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are we retreating? We…won, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She didn't remember. She didn't have a view of the battlefield. Teres had just charged and fought until she heard the calls to retreat, or someone told her to rest. Mars looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sort of, Teres. We tore the enemy apart. We might have stayed; run them down and taken prisoners. But his Majesty got word from Orthenon and Gazi there's a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; army moving to reinforce. Sixty thousand strong. Fresh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teres looked at Mars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're…not going to stop them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The forces of Reim were split. Orthenon and Gazi were circling, striking Jecrass with fast-moving cavalry. And Shepard Zamea and her half-Giants, who could keep pace. At the same time, Flos commanded the largest of his armies, with Mars and the Rustängmarder protecting him, and Parasol Stroll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They kept clashing with Jecrass, and Jecrass was usually the army that fell back or took the worst of the battle. Every time, actually. The King of Destruction's army was just filled with too many elites, and he and Mars and his best vassals were higher-level than their opponents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they could not advance. Jecrass—and half of Belchan as well—were stalemated. For every battle Reim won, they lost a dozen smaller battles. Because King Raelt of Jecrass had managed to duel the King of Destruction even in war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raiding parties&lt;/em&gt;. Fast-moving Jecrass riders who attacked held settlements, overran garrisons or threatened supply lines. Jecrass was famed for the speed of its riders and it had proven that here. Flos' armies couldn't advance too far or they'd be cut off, surrounded, destroyed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;By the same token however, Jecrass couldn't defeat the King of Destruction or his vassals in a pitched battle. Reim's armies were nearly as numerous as Jecrass' by now, and every engagement they won left far more dead on Jecrass' side than Reim's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Jecrass had reinforcements. Mars was cursing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Those were Silver-rank adventurers supporting from the sides. And Orthenon reported hacking up a team of Gold-ranks. So Medain's supporting Jecrass. And Stitch-Soldiers from Nerrhavia…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other nations were backing Jecrass. Not officially; few had declared open war, like A'ctelios Salash. But they were sending gold, soldiers, and even artifacts to Raelt to help him push back Reim, weaken the nation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So far—it was about even. Teres knew the dead numbers hurt Reim in the long term, but she and the [Soldiers] were also leveling. In time—the battle might wear Reim down too far. But &lt;em&gt;survival&lt;/em&gt; mattered most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have an army of sixty thousand joining the ones we just smashed. Some of those sands-cursed half-Elf elites from the Claiven Earth too. Insanely good [Archers]. They could tear us apart and if the [Trick Riders] shield them—I can't kill them. I hope this city's good enough to help us repel a siege. Because if Raelt pulls all his forces—he could overwhelm us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mars was looking ahead. Teres saw a distant city, lying flat against the horizon on Jecrass' border. Not one of the hill-cities with natural walls or heights to help fortify it. Even she knew that was a bad sign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"His Majesty assured me reinforcements were not needed. We stand at Sadomere, Lady Mars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then we trust him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Mars said. She rode ahead and Teres saw they were catching up. A [King] rode close to the head of his vanguard. Flos of Reimarch was sitting thoughtfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He too had dried blood on his armor. His beard. Yet, he looked calm. War was second-nature to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Teres. Are you well?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Flos of Reim turned his head and looked at her. Teres nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Worn out. Your Majesty. Sadomere doesn't &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; defensible. And our army is worn out. They may level, but we'll be outnumbered by those fresh reinforcements. And they have &lt;em&gt;half-Elf archers. &lt;/em&gt;At least a thousand of them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mars emphasized the words. Flos grimaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Marksmen. Teres, you'll keep back if we have to sortie. They can shoot through a gap in a visor. Any of them over a hundred years old who train for it, anyways. Half-Elves who practice war are nightmares on the field."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And we can hold Sadomere?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps. I believe so. I have a plan, Mars. Trust me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Illusionist smiled. She tossed her head and her perfect face and body—splashed by red—looked radiant in the setting sun. A heroine out of a tale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, sire. Although—Orthenon wouldn't."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, he's not here. Let's get the army inside the walls. Teres, come. You'll rest. I have no doubt the city will be besieged within the next…four hours?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Probably."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teres wearily slumped on her saddle. The two veterans spoke, talking of numbers and strategy. She looked up only once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is this all to make Chandrar better? I thought Raelt was an honorable man."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw the King of Destruction turn his head. He looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"King Raelt is an honorable man. A brave one, too. He clashed with Orthenon personally in battle this morning. And I bear him no ill will personally. As a [King]? Yes. But he is a good man."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] paused. And he looked at Teres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But he sheltered that Prime Minister. He is backed by my enemies. This is Chandrar, Teresa Atwood. We shed blood like water over squabbles. Like the Drakes. Like Baleros. Like any nation. If you want peace, Chandrar must be united. And to do that, I have killed many good men."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes flashed in the twilight. Teres looked at him. Another man's morality. A [King]'s logic. At the moment—Teres didn't want to hear it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where's Trey?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all she asked. Nawalishifra was gone south, towards Reim. She was no fighter. But Gazi had arrived on the battlefield a few days ago, after returning from her mission from A'ctelios. The half-Gazer's eye was still closed. But Flos had been happy nonetheless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was Trey whom Teres longed to see, though. Her other half. Even apart, they were brother and sister. Twins. She wanted to see him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he had never arrived. Flos Reimarch's brow darkened. He looked at Teresa. And shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm afraid Trey will not be meeting us at Sadomere, Teres. I had thought he was simply delayed, moving slower than Gazi. Or the Quarass had need of him. But it seems…I have sent Venith after him. I have need of him. Gazi may soon need to quit the battlefield as well. Just as well; her eye is closed and it is her plan."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman looked uncomprehendingly at Flos. So did Mars. As Sadomere's gates opened and the King of Destruction's army entered the city they had taken three days ago, Teres looked at the simple, short walls. The standard battlements. And she wondered if they could hold this place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Warrior] in her asked that. But the sister looked at Flos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where's my brother? What's wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Destruction sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm afraid he's decided to disobey my orders. He left Reim, but didn't go north. He left."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For &lt;em&gt;where?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mars looked at the King of Destruction. And she chorused with Flos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Khelt.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier that day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey Atwood rode across the barren border around Khelt. Dead lands. This, of all of Khelt's wonders, was undeveloped. Lack of tending and water had turned the ground fallow. Barren. Devoid of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the undead lived beneath the soil. Armies and armies of Khelt's people, ready to fight and be destroyed again and again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They could and had overrun powerful nations before. Trey had read books in Flos' library—Khelt was not long-lived compared to some kingdoms, like the Shield Kingdoms of Chandrar. But it was still ancient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it had killed vast armies seeking to plunder it. An army of half a million had marched on Khelt, filled with powerful magicians, Djinn, and great warriors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had been overwhelmed by the seas of undead that had risen. The 'brave' invaders had slaughtered a thousand undead minions for every one of their soldiers who fell at first. But what was that to an army that was uncountable?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the power of Khelt. And while their armies were far weaker away from the capital where they had died—Khelt was unsurpassable wherever its ruler reigned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Trey did not fear the undead beneath the hooves of his horse as he rode. Nor did he listen to the escort he'd left at the border. They shouted after him. One of them—a [Captain]—even rode after Trey, bellowing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lord Atwood! &lt;/em&gt;His Majesty did not send Lord Crusland word that you should stop in Khelt! We have orders to bring you north at all speed!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had a movement Skill. Which was how Trey had reached Khelt so quickly. But the man hadn't been prepared for Trey to ride across the border. And even now—he turned his horse, eying the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was moving. Undead warriors were rising around him, lashing out. The [Captain] rode back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Atwood! King Reimarch expects you in Sadomere this evening—or tomorrow at the latest!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey ignored him. He had no desire to ride for…twelve hours straight, drinking stamina potions even with a speed Skill. Or to listen to Flos. He called back to the [Captain] who was racing back to the border.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You may tell his Majesty I am staying at Khelt. I am staying with King Fetohep as long as he will allow me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;His Majesty demands—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey looked at the [Captain] as Kheltian undead rose, forming a barricade. Protecting Trey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you want to come after me, go ahead and try."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the brave, living warriors of Reim hesitated. They looked at the undead rising out of the earth, and Trey, riding on. And they turned back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For no one demanded anything of the ruler of Khelt lightly. Not even the King of Destruction. The undead monarch, the [King] of Khelt had known the instant Trey crossed onto his lands. And he gave Trey passage, as Trey had hoped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man clutched his horse's reins, soothing the animal as it rode. It was nervous, but it had been here before. And he looked ahead. Hoping to see a…a friend. As much as Nawalishifra. Trey couldn't march to war as Gazi had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man clutched something as he rode. He halted in the dirt and sand, as Khelt began to turn to green, fed by the vast supplies of water. Slowly, he dismounted from the horse and sat on the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ahead of him were villages. Cities, tended to by the undead. Fields maintained by undead wielding hoes and shovels. A paradise built of the undead—sustained by them in a perfection that allowed hedonism and art to flourish in equal measure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Trey sat on the ground. And bowed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at something. In time, an escort rode towards him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Atwood? We are to escort you to his Eternal Majesty, Fetohep of Khelt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A mortal man called down to Trey. He was leading a carriage. Kheltian. And the escort was living—some of Khelt's few peacekeepers, high-level [Soldiers]. They respectfully bowed. And Trey looked up as his horse pooped next to him. He had been engrossed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you…well? Lord Atwood? His Majesty expresses his concern. A [Healer] and other aids will be prepared if you are injured."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord Commander] of Khelt bowed slightly in his saddle. None less had been sent to Trey. But the young man just shook his head. He climbed into the carriage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm…fine. Sorry for worrying you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he was. As the carriage rode on, Trey sat there. Well of body. Although his throat sometimes felt—cut. But that was phantom pain. He was just looking at something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A grimy backpack. Trey had washed it as best he could. But it was still filthy. And the backpack was open. The [Lord Commander] had not known what Trey held. But that was because it wasn't of this world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;King Fetohep of Khelt was in a grand mood. As the carriage bearing Trey Atwood into the city rode forth, undead soldiers lined the walkway. His people observed the carriage. Not because he had insisted upon it; he seldom made his subjects do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; they did not want to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No, simply because their ruler cared. And thus—status was awarded to Trey Atwood. For Fetohep of Khelt had few passions in death. And his people—some of whom loved only food, sex, and carnal pleasures, and some of whom took to art or other passions—followed their ruler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was &lt;em&gt;Khelt.&lt;/em&gt; Paradise of Chandrar! And the capital city was ten thousand and one marvels of art. The people were content, never wanting for anything. Those that strived created wonders. Became great visionaries, thinkers, writers, poets, artists—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And those who cared for nothing more lived and died in excess, eating as much as they cared, loving as they wished. Living. Dying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Unable to reproduce unless that honor was awarded to them. Unable to leave except by forfeiting Khelt's protections. Subject to laws some in Trey's world would have called 'unjust'. Violating 'natural laws and rights'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep would have laughed at those that questioned him. And had them executed. For his paradise was not made of any will but his own, and that of Khelt's rulers. It was not…a democracy. Those failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Khelt lived in death. And the ruler, undead, a Revenant, had lived for six hundred years maintaining Khelt's peace. He had been content, even if Khelt sometimes bent knee to those such as the King of Destruction. Passionless, even, a [King] who was slave first to his people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet this boy had Fetohep's favor. Trey Atwood was carried to the steps in front of the palace. Surrounded by a living bodyguard, flanked by the undead. People watched as the doors of the carriage were opened and Fetohep, the [King] immortal, waited for his guest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one left the carriage. After a minute, the [Lord Commander] hurried around to the side and spoke urgently. And then a young man appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was…normal. Not tall, or handsome, or elegantly poised, a genetic perfection such as some of Khelt's citizens. Trey Atwood stumbled a bit as he came up the stairs. And Fetohep looked upon his face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Trey Atwood. Welcome once again to my kingdom."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ruler swept one emaciated hand out, grandly indicating the crowds, the welcome fit for another ruler. Trey looked at him, and bowed slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You honor me, your Majesty. But I'm afraid I'm prevailing on your goodwill, King Fetohep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep didn't look put out by this. Trey nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm actually here without the King of Destruction's permission, King Fetohep. He may want to…retrieve me. May I beg your hospitality until that happens?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;If it were possible, the magical flames in Fetohep's eye sockets brightened &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; at this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Of &lt;em&gt;course.&lt;/em&gt; That insolent boy-king has no authority in Khelt. By all means, stay as long as you would wish."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His voice was triumphant. But Trey did not smile. He just clutched the ratty backpack to him as Fetohep gestured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your arrival was—intriguing. Are you well? I have the foods you most enjoyed upon your last visit prepared. Sit, and we shall discuss the matters of the world."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He swept ahead. Trey followed, and the servants picked for the day followed, bowing, offering to take Trey's burdens. He refused them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The grand banquet room where Fetohep and Trey had first eaten with the Quarass of Germina was not the place the two were led to. Rather, it was a more intimate dining room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As it had been the last few times. Fetohep had entertained Trey four times since their initial meeting, and he had taken to the rather plush private dining quarters where Trey could sit in a comfy chair as Fetohep—in a throne-like chair that had been ported to this carpeted room, filled with soft lights, delicate water running across an &lt;em&gt;indoor fountain, &lt;/em&gt;and even a sofa, hand-stitched and tailored after Trey's descriptions—relaxed and bade Trey make himself comfortable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trey Atwood. It has been long since you last came to Khelt. The King of Destruction uses you often. As is befitting of talent. But that you have come here of your will, I shall not begrudge. Nor shall the King of Destruction remove you save for your will or mine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Khelt could be said to be…besotted with his young guest. So much so that his servants stared enviously at Trey for all the praise heaped upon his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep had, once, infamously witnessed a menagerie made of every single known animal and monster in all of Chandrar upon his sporadic exoduses from Khelt by a famed [Beast Master]. And he had pronounced it 'adequate'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey though…a woman who might have been a [Beauty] in any kingdom but Khelt was serving the young man his choice of drinks stared admiringly at him. And the young man listlessly took a bit of orange juice and sipped at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, your Majesty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep noticed Trey's mood, at last. He paused, and waved a hand. Servants swept forwards, with fresh-made food prepared by expert [Chefs].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You appear…unwell, Trey Atwood. Are you truly well?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"'mfine. Thank you, your Majesty. Fetohep. I've just had…a bad few days. I'm…I'm…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey never finished the sentence. Fetohep shifted; not in outrage over the use of his name. The [King] preferred the informality. But rather, curiosity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is wrong, Trey Atwood?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I went to A'ctelios Salash. With the Quarass. And Gazi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man whispered. Fetohep paused, in accepting a magical drink which wafted green fumes he was taking care &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to let Trey inhale. He gazed upon Trey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A'ctelios Salash? That…city?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey nodded. He looked up. He had the camera in his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Flos—the King of Destruction—asked me to go. Because the Quarass was going. To…I can't say."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To heal the half-Gazer. A'ctelios' [Fleshshapers] are famed. Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep was no fool. Trey hesitated. But then he ducked his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I was forbidden to talk of it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rest assured. The mortal squabbles of nations are of no interest to me. It is a confidence I hold."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead ruler flicked one hand. And Trey's state made more sense to Fetohep. The [King] tried to remember what he had known so easily as a man. &lt;em&gt;Kindness.&lt;/em&gt; His voice softened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…The Carven City is not an easy place to visit. Even after death, I was struck by it in my visits. It is…how was your visit, Trey Atwood?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man from earth looked up. And his eyes were haunted. As [Soldiers] returning from war sometimes were. Those who had seen things that would stay with them forever. Fetohep froze, holding the green, misty drink in his goblet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For that was not the young man he had bade farewell to a week ago. Mortals changed too quickly. And Trey? He just smiled, as if he too were dead. And he had been buried in the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I visited Tombhome. With Gazi. With the Quarass. We went to a peace conference. They tried to feed me the meat. I had my throat cut and nearly died. I was attacked by a &lt;em&gt;pakheil&lt;/em&gt;. And it turned out to be someone from my world. Someone who had been tricked. I tried to kill a man. I tried to. And I killed others. Gazi got her eye back. And the city &lt;em&gt;looked at me.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spoke with a rictus of an expression on his face. His voice trembling, torn by it all. Fetohep stared, his goblet held to his open mouth in shock. The attendants shivered and whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Attendants. Leave us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] spoke at last. After a silence where Trey only shuddered. The King of Khelt looked at Trey. Then—he picked up his throne with ease, despite his emaciated arms, scooted it closer to where Trey sat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tell me what happened, Trey Atwood. From the beginning."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Trey did. The words spilled out of him, unending. The long carpet ride, Gazi and the Quarass at odds—the city, terrifying, intriguing, and then horrifying all by turns. The friendly, duplicitous people, Trey's guide, Athal, the meeting—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Gazi being healed. The Quarass slashing Trey's throat open to &lt;em&gt;teach him.&lt;/em&gt; And then the&lt;em&gt; pakheil.&lt;/em&gt; The realization. Confronting Baosar. Trying to kill him—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fleeing the city. A'ctelios, the dead city's eyes turning towards them as they flew away on the carpet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An adventure. A nightmare. When it was done, Fetohep looked at Trey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An undead ruler. A monster. A Revenant, possessed only by his will as a mortal man. Ruling his kingdom as an eternal tyrant, monarch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—a friend. Because when Trey was done, shivering, Fetohep looked at him. And he hesitated—and then put a hand on Trey's shoulder. And his eyes flared with fury for his young, mortal friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Unacceptable.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Fetohep of Khelt said. He stood, and paced the floor angrily. Reaching for a blade he no longer wore. Trey looked up as Fetohep turned to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have been given the greatest of offences, Trey Atwood. And A'ctelios Salash? &lt;em&gt;Rot&lt;/em&gt; infests Tombhome! They were not this craven, this duplicitous, this &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; a generation ago. This Baosar deserved only death. And the King of Destruction—more fool he, for risking you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They turn people into monsters. Don't they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep hesitated. He inclined his head, stiffly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Pakheil. &lt;/em&gt;Their…beasts of burden are no less than the members of their city. Warped by the flesh of their home. Visitors become &lt;em&gt;pakheil&lt;/em&gt; more than most. But—the flesh of A'ctelios is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; offered lightly. It is a&lt;em&gt; choice.&lt;/em&gt; It has always been a choice. Not a trick. A'ctelios has seldom become so…consumed by madness as what you described."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it exists. People &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; it exist. Why? How could anyone…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey rocked back and forth, shivering. He had had nightmares. He hadn't &lt;em&gt;slept&lt;/em&gt; properly since visiting the Carven City. He woke up screaming. Until Gazi had grabbed him and shaken him awake, or the Quarass. And then—just with servants rushing to his door in Reim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep beheld all of this on Trey's face. And his voice softened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The—Shield Kingdom of A'ctelios Salash was not always so, Trey Atwood. A hundred years ago, when you visited, they would have told you all of A'ctelios' dark gifts. At the very door. Offered you lodging, and food. Only if you wished it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man from England shuddered. Fetohep went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It may be—difficult to envision. But A'ctelios' people are—were—honorable. Tombhome was a place people came to by choice. To trade. And the gift of A'ctelios was a choice. A gamble. &lt;em&gt;Pakheil&lt;/em&gt; should be respected. The [Fleshshapers] should mend all physical maladies. That is what A'ctelios was."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not what I saw."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey looked at Fetohep. And the undead [King] did not gainsay his words. He looked around. Clapped his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Servants! Provide the—frozen drink with sugar and cream. Also, a tea. Food, for my guest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The servants flooded back into the room. Trey found himself beset with a milkshake, tea, creature comforts—as Fetohep insisted he eat and relax. In his classic way, the undead [King] spared no pretense at hospitality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Soon, Trey was lying on his back, being fed grapes and sips of his tea by someone while a [Masseur] attended to him from above. Fetohep reclined, drinking his magical brew as he spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have been ill-treated, Trey Atwood. And I will not soon forget A'ctelios' offense. Nor the Quarass'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His voice darkened. The undead ruler drummed one hand on the armrest of his throne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She too I bear a grudge against. For her actions against you. I am old even as immortals, few as there are, reckon it, Trey Atwood. But the Quarass I fear is so old she forgets herself. She takes the most…optimal actions towards power and considers the cost only in lives, not pain. I am sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Trey. The young man clutched at his throat as the servants murmured. There was still the faintest of scars. Fetohep hesitated. He looked at one of his attendants and then at Trey. Trying to remember himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did it—hurt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. It was just so fast. And I was—dying. She gave me a Skill. But I don't want it. Not to ever be like that again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey whispered. Fetohep's burning gaze dimmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am sorry, once again. If there is any consolation—the Quarass gave you a Skill most [Blood Mages] or [Artificers] would beg for. The power of lifesand is not inconsequential. Will you…show me one of your designs?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a kindly offer. But Trey just shuddered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, your Majesty. I can't. Not anymore. They—they want my blood."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;His creations. &lt;/em&gt;Fetohep lowered his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Quarass is young. And old. I shall send an expression of my displeasure to Germina. Now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of his eyes glinted and his servants shuddered. From across Khelt's northern border…two thousand undead soldiers rose. And began to march.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey had no notion of it. He was remembering the last. And he shuddered worst of all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought it was a dream. But I'm sure the eye &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt;. Your Majesty. Did you—do you think A'ctelios could be wa—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The word caught in his tongue. He tried it again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is it still al—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another pause. He looked at Fetohep. The [King] made a slashing motion with one hand, stopping Trey's words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trey Atwood. Some things we do not speak of. Lest they be heard by ears to which space has no barrier."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey looked at Fetohep. And he beheld fear. And that terrified Trey. Just for a moment, Fetohep rose. He looked towards the open windows that let visitors gaze upon his city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If what you refer to is so, and I believe the Quarass is also investigating…measures would be taken. I will contact her. After my first complaint is received. The Shield Kingdoms will investigate. Quickly. Decisively, even if A'ctelios is hostile."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What could you do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep looked at Trey. And his fingers drummed quickly—then stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Put it back to sleep. If the…&lt;em&gt;vision &lt;/em&gt;moves—there are ways. It has happened thrice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey's heart began to beat faster. The masseur looked very afraid as she concentrated on her task. The teacup wobbled as someone offered it to Trey. He drank, as much to pretend the world was normal as to quench his thirst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He hesitated. Fetohep was raising a cautionary hand. Trey gulped and chose his words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something happened thrice? More than—vision?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, the [King] looked around. And he nodded once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A matter of trust, Trey Atwood. This is not to be repeated. Attendants—you will not listen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They all covered their ears. Trey saw Fetohep lean over. The [King] whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thrice before. Vision is the start. Once—the first time—the solution was not found. Next came tremors all Chandrar felt.&lt;em&gt; Movement. &lt;/em&gt;But it was stopped. It must be stopped. I promise you. It will be done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey stared at Fetohep. The [King] sat back and slashed with his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Attendants. Serve. Trey Atwood, enough. Khelt will aid Germina in investigating with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; haste. But we speak no more of…unpleasant matters. Is that clear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man nodded. Fetohep relaxed. The attendants, shaken, looked at their [King]. And as he sought for conversation, his eyes brightened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do not worry, Trey Atwood. You have been mistreated, but that has ceased since you are now in my domain. I know you have been occupied. But tell me…have you heard aught of the world's news since you have returned?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey looked up. His terror over what was being hinted at—began to fade. Fetohep's gaze was forcing the very conclusion out of his head. As perhaps, the [King] willed it. Trey would remember later. But for now, he and the people of Khelt relaxed. For Fetohep was almighty in his domain. His very presence was safety. Comfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only the [King] bore fear and worry for the future. That his subjects and friends would not have to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey was feeling a bit better—and how not, when the massage was undoing tension he didn't even know he had? The Skill was literally soothing him—as Fetohep surely knew—and he could distract himself enough to respond.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, your Majesty. I came back and I was—withdrawn. Has something happened? I know about the war in Jecrass—his Majesty, Flos, ordered me to go north. But…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep waved an impatient hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not that. I…or rather, my treasures were recently uncovered. The Diamond Swords of Serept were found by a group of students. Adventures. There was…a battle at sea. Among the major sea powers. You—you didn't hear of it? I had…some role in the events."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked keenly at Trey. And the [King] looked keenly disappointed when Trey shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, your Majesty. How were you involved? Were you at sea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As an apparition. The Diamond Swords forged by Serept were cursed by an enchantment. Among other things, it allows the ruler of Khelt to manifest themselves—it is of no consequence. It was—a minor affair. Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] paused. Eying Trey. And the young man resolved to find out what a 'minor affair' for Fetohep looked like. After a moment, Trey thought to inquire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What of the Diamond Swords? Forgive me, your majesty. I don't know anything about them. Would you be so gracious as to enlighten me? If it's not too much of a burden, that is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep's magical flames in his eye sockets brightened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I suppose I could enlighten you. &lt;em&gt;Attendants!&lt;/em&gt; Fetch the magical recording of the events. You see, the six swords are treasures forged by Serept of Khelt, Trey Atwood. Each one possesses an unparalleled magical enchantment. And I granted half to the treasure seekers…ah, but the pictures should illuminate the events…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For the next…two hours, Trey found himself watching an aerial blow-by-blow of the events surrounding Wil and the others at sea, with Fetohep's associated commentary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I would have given the Pact of Temius to the Gnoll, and perhaps The Unfilled Cup of Cexila to the Minotaur had &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; had the choice. That would be the…blue blade and red blades respectively."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why, your Majesty?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey stared at Wil as the young man duplicated himself and charged the enemy. Fetohep waved a lazy hand, freezing the recording.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Pact of Termius is a blade that calls upon the powers of nature and animals, befitting a Gnoll [Shaman]. And the Cup of Cexila is a blade which drinks the blood of those it slays, healing the wielder. Blood and flesh, really. But The Windblade of Seripsel is fitting too. I understand that the three remaining blades will return to me in time—although the carriers have been forced to take shelter at Zeres. A tiring development, but I had allowed them time to return the blades to me. Especially in light of their companion…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He trailed off. Trey looked at Fetohep. But he wasn't caught up yet. And this little…event with Fetohep actually had helped Trey. Distracted him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But—not forever. As Trey rose, the massage done, he felt better. Fetohep glanced at Trey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, you found the massage to your liking? Perhaps now we may retire to the…sauna. Or are you in need of other refreshments?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sauna was a popular way to 'bathe' in Chandrarian cultures. Hot stones and steam, rather than costly water. Trey ducked his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, your Majesty. But I'm…fine. I truly am. I'm just sorry for prevailing on you. I should have gone north. To my sister. She's—fighting in the war. Against Jecrass. I had no idea it was happening until we got back. Well, the Quarass wasn't happy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bowed. Fetohep looked disconsolate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, yes. The war. It was displeasing to me to hear the events as they unfolded. Let us discuss &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, then. Cancel the sauna."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spoke to a servant who bowed and hurried off. Trey sat in his chair and Fetohep relaxed. This was all for Trey's benefit; the humidity just made Fetohep's preserved flesh rot faster. But he took visceral pleasure from watching his guests fulfilled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you…know the events that led to the war unfolding, Trey Atwood?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sort of, your Majesty. But please, I'm sure you have a more, uh, complete view of what happened?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep nodded. He was, in some ways, easy to placate via flattery and acknowledgement of his status and vision. But perhaps—that was because he liked Trey. If he had a flaw, it was his kindness. Even in death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was one of the requirements to become a ruler of Khelt, though. Fetohep had told Trey that he had been chosen among others because he loved his people, more than he was the best warrior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed, I witnessed the events, Trey Atwood. It began with the foolishness of the Prime Minister of Belchan. But also—the cowardice of mortals. A single village's misplaced prejudice. The death of Gnolls."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He told Trey the events simply and with less commentary than his exploits at sea. Trey listened. His heart broke for the Gnoll tribe, attacked, for no crime other than being Gnolls and seeking the King of Destruction's favor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He heard how the King of Destruction had challenged Raelt of Jecrass. And in so doing—the King of Duels had earned his name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A tale of wrath, of sorrow. Of terrible deeds. Like Trey's own. Fetohep finished simply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The King of Destruction would have slaughtered the Prime Minister. And his officials. The politicians, the Watch Captains, the rulers of each city and village responsible for the carnage. He put hundreds to death for his justice. What say you to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, Trey Atwood?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead ruler's voice was disapproving. Yet, Trey Atwood looked at him. And his hand clenched on the bag that still sat at his feet, smelling of rotten flesh and a city of horrors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do I say? I say—good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep glanced at Trey, surprised by the response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Good? The slaughter of so many would be good?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey bowed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Some people deserve to die. Some monsters shouldn't live for what they've done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He clutched the pack to his chest and closed his eyes. Fetohep's eyes flared, with that undead ruler's perfect morality. But he looked at the young man who grieved. And held his own tongue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the silence of Fetohep's glorious kingdom, and his rich rooms full of artwork and treasure, the King of Khelt saw Trey shaking. The young man, the [Sand Mage] held the bag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I didn't know. I couldn't stop anything. They were—they tried to &lt;em&gt;warn me.&lt;/em&gt; I couldn't even help them. They're &lt;em&gt;still alive.&lt;/em&gt; They knew it was me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked up. His eyes were overflowing. Fetohep beheld dark rage. Fury. A young man's grief. And he looked around, unsettled. Unsure of what to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep of Khelt, in his glory and riches…looked at his young friend. Shaking. And he gestured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps…the comforts of the flesh? You have witnessed a tragedy, young Trey. I was similarly unsettled when first I visited A'ctelios. I think. When I fought Crelers for the first time, certainly. You are young. You there. Summon a seraglio of Khelt's finest. Drinks. Even such pleasures as dreamleaf—no, the Vault of Wishes. Procure it and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey didn't listen. He was fumbling with the bag. Drawing out the camera. Fetohep, meaning well, summoned Khelt's most beautiful women—and a few handsome men and boys—trinkets of unsurpassed value. Drugs of every sort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it wouldn't help. It didn't help. A bevy of people willing to give Trey a night out of his wildest imagination—solo or in a group—stopped at the doorway. A magical vault containing one's wildest imaginations halted on a pillow of silk. A hundred substances of various effects halted on their way towards the room, all legal in Khelt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because the young man wanted none of it. He showed Fetohep something. And the ruler slowly dismissed his thousands of expensive, worthless treasures. Because this was Trey's grief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is this, Trey Atwood?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was…a camera. Trey had found it in the bag that had belonged to the &lt;em&gt;pakeil.&lt;/em&gt; The person. And he had fixed it. With magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Repair] was such a useful spell. And Trey had…recharged the camera. Given it new life after it had run out of power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a good camera. The kind you'd take a semi-professional video on. To upload it to Youtube, take videos with. It was, of course, capable of pictures. And video.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He wished he'd never found it. For…it had memories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A young man standing in the sand. Surveying the landscape. He cursed—in an unfamiliar language. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Where are we?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view included a group of eighteen. Staring about, shouting, trying to call on their phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what he asked, but in another language. Portuguese? That was the first video. The next few were similar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view from atop a dune. Surveying a vast, vast landscape of sand to the north. To the south? More habitable lands. A shout—someone screaming as loudly as he could behind the speaker. A voice—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Hey! You—you with the camera! Come down here!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Accented English. Russian? The next videos gave clarity. To Trey, they were as sensible as his appearance in Chandrar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;People milling about. Talking&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;At last, there was sense. The wielder of the camera turned it back to his face. Trey saw a worried, smiling face. Other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A young man from Russia. A pair of Taiwanese visitors. Someone who said they had been with their parents—crying. Being consoled by an older Chinese woman—and she was barely twenty six. Still, oldest of the lot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We are somehow &lt;/em&gt;here&lt;em&gt;, now. We don't know how we got here. We were in an airport—this is going to be a record of what's happened. Just—just in case."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man had good English. And he began taking videos of each of the eighteen people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Eighteen lives. Each one, who turned to the camera and told the viewer, Trey and Fetohep their names. Repeating where they had been from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Travelling back home."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Going to visit Hong Kong with my—my parents. Are they okay? Do you think—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Some kind of plane crash. We're all hallucinating. That's what—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Water? We're going to need—I'm—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Young people, as young as Trey, older—but not by much. But a girl who was barely fifteen, who'd been standing &lt;em&gt;with her parents&lt;/em&gt; when she'd vanished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was no logic to it. The Russian man had been holding his girlfriend's hand. But she—despite being his age—hadn't come along. And they were far from home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lost, in Chandrar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Videos. At some point after taking each person's introduction, the Portuguese cameraman had realized he was going to run out of power. So he'd begun rationing them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The next video was of someone yelling. One of them—the Russian—had leveled up. As an [Explorer] in the night. Someone else? [Survivor]. A third—[Traveller].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I am—I'm a Level 3 [Cameraman], yeah? It was green. No one else said it was green. But I—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The young man looked into the camera. Grinning, as people discussed what it meant. They all had Skills. One of them tried it out. Pointed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"[Survivor's Intuition]! There's something that way!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A short cut. And then—the others clustered around a small cactus plant. One of them—a fellow from Cameroon—had a knife. He was scraping at the plant, removing the bristles to get to the flesh. They were all talking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It hurt to watch. Stop. &lt;em&gt;Stop it.&lt;/em&gt; Trey kept playing the videos. He'd seen them too many times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The next time the camera came on, the people were shouting at a caravan. The viewpoint captured a flying figure. A Garuda, spotting them. The others shouted, or stared. Some looked wary, but the caravan was kindly. Humans rode towards them on camels, shouting. In English—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Are you hurt? What was it? [Bandits]?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Where are you from?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bewildered answers. Confusion—and already, as some of them eyed the swords and wands—cautiousness. The travellers from Earth lied, and the caravan, after some swift bartering for a colorful scarf, a water bottle and a few trinkets—took them in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The battery had begun running low. Trey saw only three more videos. He clicked on the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I have—I have a Skill. Green. [Extended Battery]. I think it will save me some battery. I &lt;/em&gt;think&lt;em&gt;. But this is another…world, yeah? A game. That's what one of us said. We are getting close to a city, now. For food. Shelter. We're going to…stop there…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The young man looked worried. But optimistic. He smiled. He was always smiling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We're headed towards it. It is a nice place. Apparently? I will show you more. The battery is running low. I can't recharge—so this is Davi, signing off."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Darkness. Two left. Trey's finger shook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;A'ctelios Salash. Welcome, welcome to the Carven City! All are welcome here! Food, drink—all free!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A laughing face. A demon wearing a Human's skin. Davi eagerly filmed…Athal. Welcoming them inside. He began taking images of the interior of A'ctelios, after the outside. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the Earthers saw what the city was. Some—refused to enter. The Russian man walked off, after arguing bitterly with his group. He pointed at the eyes that had become entrances and shouted that it was madness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some followed. A girl. A young man from Canada named Rémi. But fifteen entered. The young man from Portugal, Davi, was unsettled. He filmed the inside. The cavernous room, the smiling people. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The strange cries of a baby. The meat they were given, succulent, free of charge by Athal, who grinned as Davi and the others scarfed the food after a long time on the road.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep was touching Trey's arm. The young man didn't know it, but he was crying. His finger shook. But the last video—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Something. Wrong."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A voice. Cracked. In pain. Davi's face appeared in the frame. In darkness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the background, someone was crying out. Rhythmically. In pain. Davi was clutching at his stomach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The meat—it was—a trap."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He whispered to the camera. Someone was moving in the corner. Davi looked up. He saw the man from Cameroon. With a knife, stained red. He reached down, his body jerking. He was already…transforming. Davi shook his head as the knife lowered—the man staggered away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"What did we do wrong?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That was all Davi said. He tried to say something else. But the broadcast continued. As he jerked—the others fell silent, given a last mercy or…too far gone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They changed. And a young man picked his way across the ground, ignoring the &lt;/em&gt;pakheil&lt;em&gt; as they screamed. Athal picked up the camera, investigated it eagerly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Look! An artifact! They had an artifact! Tell my father—we can sell this—how does it work? Why is that thing flashing red? One? 1%? What—"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the last. Trey saw the screen go dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There were a few…pictures. Of Athal. Of a few people, blinking stupidly into the camera. He must have used it. But the camera had run out of power. And Athal must have thought it was just junk. So he'd put it in the bag. And the &lt;em&gt;pakheil&lt;/em&gt;—Davi—had remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Until he'd attacked Trey. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's still there. In A'ctelios. He's probably alive, even after he was—nothing dies there. He's alive. And he's—&lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey wept onto the camera as it turned off. Fetohep sat next to him. Staring at the dark screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had witnessed it all. The [King] was silent. And Trey?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had tried to kill Baosar. He had failed, but Gazi had done the job. Trey wished now, he'd killed Athal. That he'd had the power to burn A'ctelios Salash to ash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they'd run. And Davi was still alive. Part of Trey wished he'd never known the young man's name. Because it was his face Trey saw in his nightmares. Eating down the meat and remarking how good it was. Thanking the inhabitants of Tombhome for their generosity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will never forgive them. I won't. Someday. I'll come back. And I'll bury Tombhome again. I will kill them all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was his vow. Trey looked up at Fetohep. And the undead ruler looked at him with sympathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trey Atwood. This evidence of wrongdoing by A'ctelios' inhabitants I cannot forgive. Nor will I ever forget it. The Carven City will be held to my justice. Khelt is not weak."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It has to be erased."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man reached out. He grasped at Fetohep's robes, speaking pleadingly. And Fetohep—hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There are things worse than A'ctelios' depravity, Trey Atwood. I do not ask that you understand. But I rule Khelt. And I have seen Crelers and worse. A'ctelios is madness. But it is a weapon to be borne against all foes. It is—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Madness? Madness is a weapon? What enemy do you use it against?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey looked at Fetohep. And the undead ruler's fiery eyes dimmed. But he replied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dragons. And far worse. When they are needed, A'ctelios' mad legions will fight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So you won't destroy them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all he cared about. Trey met Fetohep's gaze. The [King] shook his head with true regret.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A ruler cannot always be moral, Trey Atwood. Nor do I know if A'ctelios &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be destroyed with all of Khelt's power. Buried, perhaps. But the Tombhome was slain by the original inhabitants of A'ctelios. And they were &lt;em&gt;heroes. &lt;/em&gt;They felled a nightmare. That excuses none of this generation's offense. But it is a reason…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He trailed off. Trey looked at him and turned away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trey Atwood. I would do much in my power for you. But I am still a [King]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The voice was quiet. Trey shuddered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know, your Majesty. Thank you. But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He brushed at his eyes. And felt as if he'd wept all his tears. Slowly, Trey Atwood rose. And he looked around. At Fetohep, resting in his seat, unchanging. At Khelt, this perfect place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have to go. Don't I?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep of Khelt paused. And his undead gaze flickered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Not if you do not wish to. I have told you: Khelt welcomes you, Trey Atwood. Stay as you wish. My subjects will offer you every comfort. My treasuries will satisfy your wildest imaginations. Ask what you will. And it will be granted to you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like…a friend. A grandfather. A kindly ruler, offering Trey anything he wanted. And the young man was so tempted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A night with the most beautiful woman. Food and drink unlimited. Magical treasures. Safety, comfort, riches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was all here. &lt;em&gt;Here,&lt;/em&gt; waiting for him. Fetohep would give it to Trey and not even Flos would be able to take Trey away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the truth. But the young man turned. He looked Fetohep in his undead face. And he did not flinch. That was part of why Fetohep loved him. Trey inhaled, once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your Majesty. Do any of the King of Destruction's vassals seek me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead [King] hesitated. But then he nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Venith Crusland has brought five thousand of Reim's [Soldiers]. He is attempting to cross the border. None of his party have sustained more than superficial injuries. Yet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Loyalty. Trey closed his eyes. Venith &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; try Khelt, even if it meant fighting all of the undead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have to go, your Majesty. I have…a mission. I can't speak of it, truly. His Majesty has orders for me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Must you go? You owe that boy nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ruler of Khelt almost reached for Trey. And the young man stepped away. He smiled at Fetohep. And he bowed, deeply. Gratefully. But he still left. Trey walked towards the door, and as Fetohep rose, he spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your Majesty. You are too kind to me. You have given me every comfort in this world, and I am eternally grateful. And you are wise. Wiser than I. But—that is why I must go. Because I am mortal. And flawed. And I see A'ctelios' horrors. And I cannot forgive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed. Fetohep looked at the camera, sitting on the little table. Trey had left it behind, with the backpack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You see why A'ctelios is needed. The lives of a few can be sacrificed for the good of all. And that is—a [King]'s wisdom. But I serve the King of Destruction. And he would go to war for a single child. He will give me vengeance if I ask. Thank you. And—goodbye. I fear it might be some time before we meet again. If we do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trey—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Trey bowed again. He turned and left. And then he was gone. Riding south. To his fate. To serve the King of Destruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep felt him go. He sat still, unmoving, until Trey had left his lands. And that took &lt;em&gt;hours.&lt;/em&gt; Only then did the [King] rise. And he walked listlessly out of his room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His treasures awaited him. His people. But the [King] was suddenly alone. And he stood awhile, on a balcony overlooking his magnificent city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pondering what he had lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The army of Jecrass was marching on Sadomere. A battered thirty—no, closer to forty thousand plus reinforcements. A hundred thousand to pit against half that number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbers. But even so—Teres was aware of how vulnerable they were. The city of Sadomere was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Reim. It wasn't built as strongly, had no secret weapons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And only one of the King's Seven was here to defend it. Mars was also, arguably, the worst person to defend a city. She could hold a hallway until the entire structure came down around her. But a wall where there was only one of her?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No. And the walls were exposed. The [Builders] had made the city well, but not with an eye for sieges. Proper siege architecture was usually ugly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was also a strategic move. Denying an enemy a useful foothold on the border between both nations meant that it was disadvantageous to actually rely on the city. Like in…moments like these.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Milord. We're surrounded."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. Hm. Hold on, I have a message from Venith. I think it's good news."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Flos Reimarch was checking a [Message] on the magical scroll he carried. He smiled as Teres, Ytol, and Mars inspected the army.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were surrounding the city. And they had no siege weapons as Teres understood them. No ballistae, or trebuchets, let alone cannons or the high-tech weapons from her world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; a few primitive catapults that could hurl stones a decent distance. But that was all. Jecrass' forces didn't really need conventional siege weapons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had [Mages]. Ulyse, Mirin, and Esiela of Parasol Stroll approached Flos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your Majesty. The enemy has a number of high-level [Mages]. Grand Mage Esiela counts a number of Claiven Earth's high-level [Mages]. Not the highest-level. Thirty plus—but they could punch a hole through the walls."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ulyse, the leader, reported. Esiela, the former Grand Mage of Belchan, ducked her head, hiding her face as Flos turned towards them. The King of Destruction's gaze paused on her for a second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see. Can you fend them off, Ulyse?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Mage] hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I suspect they will attack from multiple sides, your Majesty. To prevent our own from being sniped, we will have to concentrate on one wall. We will do our best, but only a single [Geomancer] need collapse an unenchanted wall to create a breach."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see. Well then, I will take it into account. Deploy to the northern wall, Ulyse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, your Majesty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a measure of the [Mage]'s trust that he only bowed without asking…questions. But there was nowhere to run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Trey has left Khelt! Of his own will. Venith is escorting him to Germina. And Gazi will ride south to meet them. Good, good. We may be able to arrange a meeting, Teres, but the plan is still going ahead. I had feared…Trey would seek Fetohep's mercy. And I would have been unable to stop him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Destruction laughed in genuine relief and good humor. Teres looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If we meet him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] glanced at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—it may be hard to arrange. Or did you mean this battle? Orthenon's taught you well, Teres. What do you think our odds are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Shit?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teres heard another laugh. But Mars wasn't laughing. The enemy had them outnumbered. And worse—Jecrass' elite cavalry had taken to the field. And yes, they were terrible at sieging a city until the gates fell, and you could still create walls of pikes to stop them coming in—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But going out? Sortieing meant you'd be charged, and you'd never outrun them. If Flos was confident of defending, Teres wouldn't have worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the Claiven Earth had sent their troops to support Jecrass. Oh—'mercenaries'. And the half-Elves were good [Archers].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were even able to hit Sadomere's defenders from a thousand paces away. The longbow [Archers] would trade out, use a Skill, and launch arrows that hit the defenders hiding behind the battlements. Only Maresar or similarly skilled [Archers] would have been able to counter them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the [Mages]—Teres knew that Parasol Stroll was good, but she didn't have much hope. Even if Flos' army repelled this one, it would be a brutal siege. And Jecrass could just pull in more troops if they were losing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're right, Teres. It's not good. These walls were never built to counter enemies like this. Let alone the fact that we'll be dealing with breaches. Once they enter the city, Jecrass' cavalry will have an open battleground. Not nice alleyways."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Flos glanced over his shoulder at the city. Teres nodded. Damn wide streets and efficient municipal planning. But the King of Destruction was smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Milord. They're advancing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here they came. &lt;/em&gt;Flos Reimarch's head snapped up as the [Archers] began to advance within bow range. Infantry moved forwards, screening and hiding the vulnerable [Mages].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mars. I'm relying on you. Use your ranged weapons. Force those [Mages] back. For…ten minutes. Ulyse has the north wall—take the east. The west is the Rustängmarder—only idiots would concentrate on them. Teres! You and I will stand on the south walls. Perhaps that will dissuade them. Grab a shield. And watch for those high-level shots. Nuisances."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Destruction strode forwards. He raised his shield casually as Teres kept a distance behind him. Every now and then Flos would &lt;em&gt;swat&lt;/em&gt; an arrow out of the air meant for him, even if it curved or tried to vanish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jecrass' army was advancing. Their [Archers] threw up hails of deadly arrows as Flos' tired army tried to return fire. It was technically in Flos' favor; even with elites, his army had range and protection. Only the numbers favored the attackers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the fact that they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; cause a breach and allow their army to make it a more even fight. The King of Destruction reached the southern wall. And there he stood, waving at the enemy army. Teres swore she could see General Lael hesitating as she saw the King of Destruction facing her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Flos. What's your plan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait. We have to let them get closer, Teres. You know I have a plan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're not a complete dunce."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Destruction grinned toothily at Teres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, Teres. In truth—a Drake or Minotaurian army would be worse. They have siege weapons along with [Mages]. But this is fine. And I do have a plan."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The [Army of the King]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He smiled at her and angled his shield to block an arrow. Flos winced as it detonated and swore as both his and Teres' ears rang from the fireball.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Damned explosive arrows! &lt;/em&gt;Not yet. That must be used for a battle where it cripples my enemies. Or else it is wasted for a month. No—watch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The enemy army was charging the city. Teres saw Ulyse and the other [Mages] exchanging fire with the northern wall's attackers. But soon—far too soon—there was an &lt;em&gt;explosion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From the southern wall. Flos swore and grabbed at Teres as the wall began to collapse near them. A [Geomancer] had caved it in. And the army, realizing the King of Destruction had few [Mages] there—was charging at the gap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Pikes! Get below and prepare for a charge!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then the wall &lt;em&gt;rippled.&lt;/em&gt; And Teres saw another section cave in on the eastern side. She looked at Flos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Mages]. One cannot fight without them. And my armies are light on [Mages]. Don't fear, Teres."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He heaved a sigh. The King of Destruction looked out as more parts of the wall began to collapse. There were less defenders on it than Teres realized. Perhaps anticipating he'd lose the walls, the King of Destruction had pulled his forces back. But they were getting ready to clash with fresh Jecrassian troops and the other army's elites soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Flos. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the plan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Destruction stood on the crumbling walls of his city as Jecrass' army began to charge. He spoke, casually to Teres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just this, Teres. You had no way of knowing. Nor Raelt, or my enemies. But they might have considered it if they remembered that I am just a man."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Teres. And she, holding his hand, saw him let go. Teres stumbled. And Flos Reimarch turned to the walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"King Raelt of Jecrass is a worthy foe. He leveled up after challenging me and &lt;em&gt;winning.&lt;/em&gt; In his way. That battle turned him into a force to be reckoned with. But no one in this world wins singlehandedly. &lt;em&gt;General Lael!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bellowed. The distant [General] saw Flos raise his arms. The King of Destruction laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Congratulations on your [King]'s new levels! And yours as well, no doubt! And might I add one more thing?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed at her. And the [King] smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I leveled up too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man raised one fist. Teres saw him point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For you, my glorious [Architect]. This—Skill is for you. &lt;em&gt;[The King's Architect]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bellowed the Skill. And Teres saw—the King of Destruction disappear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment, time slowed across the city of Sadomere. Which was—when you got down to it, a shitty name for a city, wasn't it? And what terrible architecture!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sadomere. What is that, a name of a horse? Maybe a horse designed these walls."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teres heard a man's voice. And she saw an old, grumpy man walking across the walls. In between the galloping horses' hooves hitting the ground, he strode, looking around the broken rubble. And beside him strode a man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, yes. The name is bad. I'll rename it something appropriate. &lt;em&gt;Drevish's Posthumous Masterpiece,&lt;/em&gt; or some such. Can we fix it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you name the city that, I'll design a guillotine so you can kill yourself. Come on, we have work to do. [Riders], huh? And [Archers] and [Mages]. How do you get yourself into these messes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment, the old man's annoyed voice passed Teres. And she saw him glancing past her, through her. Seeing only the city. What it was, and could be. And the [King] walked with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he too was—a memory. The real King of Destruction stood on the walls a heartbeat later, staring after him. Teres breathed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drevish?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Architect], a memory of him, turned. And Flos Reimarch raised a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Drevish! My [Architect]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment, his voice was pained. And he cried across the wall to the man in the distance. Reaching out at an illusion. Teres saw the white-haired figure bow. And the city changed around them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Time snapped back to reality. Jecrass' charging [Riders] saw the gaps in the city. They charged through, screaming, upon the unprepared army of the King of Destruction. And saw—too late—the angled ramps, poised in the gaps to break their charge. Stone itself had reshaped to create the barriers, wide enough to allow infantry to fight in, but perfect to halt any number of horses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Riders] tried to stop, but they crashed into the barricades as the infantry swarmed them. And the walls—Teres turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Arrows! Take cover!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone screamed. But the arrows that rained down on the walls from the elite [Archers] all missed. The young woman lowered her shield. And she saw—along the walls, now with rebuilt defenses that created total cover from above and the sides for archers, more like tunnels with crenellations than battlements—another addition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Statues. They were huge, imposing, rising along the walls, practically drawing the eye. And they drew more than that. Arrows &lt;em&gt;curved&lt;/em&gt; through the air to smack the statues in the face rather than the defenders. Magical interception. Flos' [Archers] rained down on the other army.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Destruction blinked at the statues taunting their foes. He leaned over the battlements for a view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that—are they all wearing &lt;em&gt;Orthenon's&lt;/em&gt; face?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Teres stared and her jaw dropped. They were indeed, larger-than-life versions of Orthenon, scowl perfectly captured. The [Stewards] stood amid the rain of spells and arrows, bits of the magical stone being blasted away. And the skill had done more than that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;General Lael! The city's changed! We're receiving fire from—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Jecrassian [Soldiers] shouted at the [General] commanding the siege. She stared up at some impossibly high towers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What in the name of unicorns is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Flos turned. A number of insanely high watchtowers had been constructed. As tall as skyscrapers. And the [Archers] on top—after getting over their acrophobia—were raining down arrows on the enemy with unparalleled range.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Those are Drevish's experimental Skytowers! He swore they'd be the best thing for [Marksmen]! Orthenon and I told him they'd be knocked over in an instant!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The King of Destruction and Teres looked around. The city was transformed. Gone were the wide streets; they were now narrow, with choke points. The gates had been reinforced and given a second layer of portcullises just to stymie attackers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And all with the stone available. As if the [Architect] had simply moved stone and masonry around, enchanted a few objects. Flos looked about his city. Teres stared at the Skytowers, jutting out from the sides of the city, inordinately high and casting shadows, the tight houses, the weird horse-traps. She was the one who said it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This place is a &lt;em&gt;nightmare&lt;/em&gt; of a city to live in!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Flos Reimarch began to laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It &lt;em&gt;is!&lt;/em&gt; But it's the perfect thing to beat an army, isn't it? Especially &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; army?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Indeed, the [Mages] were sending tremors into the ground and finding the city's foundations were beyond solid. The two gaps in the wall were turning into kill zones. And—the King of Destruction looked about. His laughter ceased. And he looked at Teres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drevish. One of my Seven. Immortalized in my Skill. It is beyond fitting. The other two—I would like to see them again, Teres."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He quieted. And as the horns began to blow a retreat, the King of Destruction stood on his battlements. Remembering a man Teres had never met. And as she looked at the crazy architecture, all the experimental designs, like the slanted &lt;em&gt;bowl&lt;/em&gt; the enemy army would have to run down and up to get to the inner city, the statues of Orthenon—and the ones with the stupid faces the [Steward] would have never made—she wished she'd met him too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The war continued. King Raelt's armies fell back, as Sadomere, rechristened &lt;em&gt;Drevish's Madness&lt;/em&gt;, became a linchpin of the King of Destruction's defensive line. But the King of Challenges refused to retreat. And his nation refused to surrender to the King of Destruction. And either way it seemed like Flos Reimarch won.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The largest port-city of Pheislant was known as Phel's Light. After a [King] who had created…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A lighthouse. Or rather, a citadel whose tallest, central structure was the lighthouse. The magical beam illuminated the sea. Guiding ships to shore and helping them navigate the dark cliffs and treacherous shoals at night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Phel's Light was, like Zeres, Lailight Scintillation, First Landing, and the other port capitals of the world, a very important place. For it was where goods flowed through. And having good relations with Pheislant was thus important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Terandria had a few big ports. Among them—the Lord of the Dance's city. Lord Belchaus was infamous for keeping his waters free of marauders. Even in wartime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But his port wasn't the best for ah…illicit cargos. Or [Slaves]. Or a lot of things. If you were at odds with Lord Bel, or his nation, it was wise to steer clear of his waters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Pheislant's harbors were frankly better. On the southwestern edge of Terandria, they permitted more easy access to Baleros, Chandrar, and Izril. Lord Bel's harbors were further to the east. Why stop there if you could go to Phel's Light?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All that meant simply that…Phel's Light had all kinds of business for anyone who was anyone in Terandria. And as evening fell across Pheislant, a particular group was awaiting a very special ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Knight-Commander Calirn of the Order of Seasons stood on the docks. Keeping a vigil. He had personally come from the Order of Seasons' headquarters—which was not very far as they were headquartered in Pheislant, technically on their own lands, but allied with the Terandrian Kingdom—to attend this somber gathering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was not alone. Some members of the Order of Spring were there, and a few keepers from the Order of Fall, to record the moment. No other Knights of Winter; but theirs was a small and solitary season. They would pass the vigil alone, mourn alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The most populous group was the Order of Summer, however. The Knights of Summer stood on the deck, nearly forty of them. They had all requested it. They were waiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not just the Order of Seasons either. &lt;em&gt;Six&lt;/em&gt; other Knighthood Orders were waiting on the docks. The Order of Ram, the Thronebearers—from Kaliv and Calanfer respectively—had greeted Calirn when he arrived on the docks. They were small orders. Not nearly as vast as the Order of Seasons, which was one of the largest in Terandria, part of Pheislant's might.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other orders were smaller too—but for one. Order of the Thirsting Veil. They stood opposite the Order of Seasons and Calirn had not greeted them. Not out of any personal enmity. But because they were Ailendamus' [Knights]. And relations were—strained between the vast kingdom of Ailendamus who was threatening war and Pheislant, their enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Normally, Calirn would have warned the hotheads of his order—the [Summer Knights] and young, impetuous [Spring Knights] not to start a conflict. But there was no fear of that today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Knights] waited in silence. They were all here waiting for the same ship. A special ship, that only [Knights] used, really.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A funeral barge. It was shared among [Knights]. And it collected their remains at every port. Sometimes bodies; usually ashes. Calirn awaited ashes. They were easy to transport and a Courier could be hired to take them. As in this case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Normally, [Knights] were buried where they fell. Only their belongings were brought back. But sometimes they had family. Loved ones who needed the closure. Sometimes, it was an honor, or just the practice of the order—like how the Thronebearers insisted on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In this case, it was both. The man who had died had perished in a quest to avenge his love. And he had asked—she had asked Calirn—that they be buried together. Even though the man had failed, Calirn would honor their request.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In ash, he sailed across the waters. A fallen [Knight]. An extinguished flame. Ser Raim of the Season of Summer had tried to burn away the Spider of Terandria, the [Witch]. Belavierr.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He had failed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was nothing more to it. He had come so close. But his mortal body had betrayed him before his radiant soul. Calirn bowed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Raim was the highest-leveled [Knight] who had died here, by far. He could sense the other Orders looking at him, wondering who had died. Some probably knew. Raim had been powerful. A [Knight] of his level could change the course of battles. Defeat the greatest of monsters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He would be missed. And Calirn would not forget the Stitch Witch's further sin on her list of transgressions against his Order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But today? He just stood there. Reflecting on his faults, that had led to Ser Raim and the [Hunter]'s deaths. For he was Knight-Commander Calirn. And he was responsible for leading his order to war. For making decisions that would lead to the death of his [Knights].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As he awaited the barge, Calirn was silent. But he was aware of a shifting in the ranks around him. At last, the [Winter Knight] raised his white-haired head—as white as the snow which he could call with the power of his aura—and looked about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Knight Commander], it was just a minor quarrel—we are ashamed to break your concentration!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Shamefaced, two of the [Spring Knights] clasped their fists to their chests. Calirn looked at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Speak."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Knights of the Spring hesitated. But the other, young, female, came out with it. Her cheeks flushed as she spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I mean no disrespect to the people of Phel's Light, Knight-Commander! But I feel it is a—a disgrace!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn gave her a blank look. The [Knight] gestured around. The docks were mostly empty. Or at least—this berth was. It was reserved for the barge, after all, so the docks themselves and the walkway on the harbor front were empty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Knights] were there—and their [Squires], a few others who had ridden with them or were related to their causes—and a handful of pedestrians. Calirn regarded them. The Spring Knight went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We are gathered here to honor our [Knights]! They have died far from Terandria's soil and return home now! It is public knowledge. There should be a crowd. There have been, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around, frustrated. Calirn understood. Usually there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a large gathering of people, who would honor the fallen [Knights] even if they didn't know who it was. But today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No. Only the closest relatives. Calirn looked at the young [Knight].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Knight Zidele, I understand your frustration. However—we have sworn an oath to perform our duties. Not for reward or fame or crowds. That &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are here is what matters, do you understand? If people do not wish to join our occasion, what reason have we to begrudge them. Should we demand a [Baker] neglect his or her livelihood to attend?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zidele flushed at the reprimand. She bowed her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Knight-Commander. It's only—if it were that, I would understand. But as I understand it—they are attending another event."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn looked at her, blankly. Zidele's voice had drawn the attention of the other knight orders. He sensed them listening in, turning their heads as most without helmets waited for the barge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Other event? What is that, Knight Zidele?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The—concert. By the Queen of Pop, Knight-Commander. She arrived in this city not two hours ago. They are all &lt;em&gt;there.&lt;/em&gt; Rather than here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Queen of…Pop?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Queen of Pop. The Siren of Songs. The Baroness of the Beat. All of these titles were…self-proclaimed. She was not, in actual fact, royalty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But her followers treated her like that. In Phel's Light, the streets were flooded. Visitors had come streaming into the city, and even the nobility and a &lt;em&gt;monarch&lt;/em&gt; was in the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Prince], in actual fact. The 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Prince of Pheislant. And two young [Ladies]—an actual [Baroness], the daughter of a [Baron] from Calanfer—and so many more had arrived in the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because the Queen of Pop, the world's first [Popstar]—was coming to perform in Phel's Light today. And the crowds? They were going nuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Much to the bemusement of anyone who &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; get it, actually. People not in the know, usually older adults, shook their heads or just stared at the younger generations lining the streets as the first coaches pulled through. They cheered madly, screaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Queen of Pop! Queen of Pop!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sing for us!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I love you! Please marry—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the [Prince]. Besotted, he'd been to the last &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; concerts. The enigmatic, famous [Singer] had been performing her way south to Pheislant. And her fame was still growing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had changed Terandria. Her songs were reaching even the most refined of monarch's courts in the form of 'albums', magical crystals that recorded sound and played them back. That wasn't new of course; people had recorded speeches, music, and so on before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the Queen of Pop's music was different. It had a…beat. A kind of flow and style and instruments this world had never dreamed of. It was pop, in a world that hadn't even discovered rock, let alone funk or jazz or…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instruments. &lt;/em&gt;The Siren of Song had an entire caravan, including wagons with her team and their belongings. She was known to have very strict requirements. And—she was also a private person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Singer] wasn't even visible, but some of her fellow performers, her band, were waving to the crowds. They were shouting and screaming and waving at the young men and women perched on the coaches or staring out the windows. And—for the befuddled [Knights] or anyone else who saw it, that was amazing. Because a [Knight] was a minor celebrity in most places outside of a city. But this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was &lt;em&gt;fame&lt;/em&gt; as the world had seldom seen it. Knight-Commander Calirn actually &lt;em&gt;heard&lt;/em&gt; the cheering as the Baroness of the Beats rolled in. The other [Knights] grumbled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Disgraceful. Knight-Commander, perhaps young Zidele is right. This isn't fitting for…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the [Summer Knights] murmured. Calirn turned his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ignore it. Or would you like to lodge a complaint with Prince Tellsiv of Pheislant?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Summer Knight] closed his mouth. But his eyes flashed, suggesting he would like to do that very thing regardless of the politics. The cheering was wild, noisesome—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were at a &lt;em&gt;wake.&lt;/em&gt; The other orders shifted. At last, one of the Thronebearers coughed and walked over. He bowed stiffly but politely; his golden armor polished to perfection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Knight-Commander Calirn, I am Ser Dalimont of the Thronebearers of Calanfer. The Thronebrearers of the Eternal Throne of Calanfer greet you on this dark day. If it is not troublesome in this moment, may we speak of inconsequential matters before the arrival of our lost fallen?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn saw the [Summer Knight] turn his head to hide a grimace. The [Knight Commander] himself winced; the Thronebearers actually took lessons in their flowery language, along with actual combat training. But he rose from his kneeling posture and nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, Ser Dalimont. Please, let us dispense with formality."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ser Dalimont relaxed, and looked relieved himself. He nodded and stepped closer. He was—probably—close to Level 30. Calirn could see the man's natural aura. Not a trained thing, like the Order of Season's higher-level [Knights]. But the Thronebearers had different Skills than the Order of Seasons, which used their auras in battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn could turn the cold air that surrounded him into a freezing vortex. Make his blade so cold it would cause frostbite in any cut. Even make a shield of ice from it. He was a [Winter Knight]; his comrades from the other seasons could make flame, hasten their steps—it was the power of one's aura, their embodiment of nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Ser Dalimont was lower-level. And his order was smaller. He bowed again to the [Knight Commander], a grandmaster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I apologize for breaking your concentration, Grandmaster Calirn. However, if I may—is it true one of your champions has fallen?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at the large gathering. Calirn inclined his head heavily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Ser Dalimont. One of our best. Ser Raim. His prowess in battle was all but unmatched."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dalimont's eyes widened. He knew the man's name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A terrible blow to your order. May I ask what enemy took his life?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I regret that I cannot say, Ser. Only that it is a pernicious foe of Terandria. One who triumphed this day. But our war continues."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Thronebearer [Knight] bowed his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Only naturally. All enemies will one day fall. And on that topic—the news from Chandrar is dire, is it not? Another nation battles the King of Destruction. My Order has debated crusading to Chandrar, but we are too few to push against such a foe. Only if dozens of [Knight] orders were to join such an effort might we throw back the King of Destruction. And even then, we would need the backing of a number of nations."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn had been having those very thoughts of late. But he saw where Dalimont was going with this—as careful as a [Courtier], the Thronebearers. He nodded and cut to the chase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Naturally, that would be best for the world. But I fear Terandria is far from united, Ser Dalimont. The possibility of war with Ailendamus makes cooperation unlikely."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both [Knights] turned. The Order of the Thirsting Veil, in their dark armor and somber gear—smelling vaguely of the poisons they loved to use—stood at attention. Dalimont's brow darkened, but Calirn was a [Knight]. He made no pretense, but raised his voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ser Knights of the Thirsting Veil. &lt;/em&gt;May we speak candidly, as befits those of honor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Knights] looked up. They looked to their leader—a woman who used a long greatsword. She strode over. Like Calirn and Dalimont, her helmet was off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grandmaster Calirn, I am Dame Hevlca. The Thirsting Veil greets you. Is aught the matter?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her words were clipped, precise. Very straightforward. Calirn nodded to her as Dalimont shifted uneasily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No direct issue, Dame Hevlca. More concern for the future of our orders and Terandria. I speak with utmost informality; this pressing war with Ailendamus may lead to our orders clashing. Or do you disagree?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman blinked. And some of the other [Knights] in earshot looked up. One of the other four orders drifted closer. This wasn't exactly improper, but Calirn was being unusually direct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—the Order of the Thirsting Veil was known to Calirn. They used poison. Yes. And their armor was black. But their hearts were pure. They were [Knights]. If anything, the Thronebearers had a more sullied history of obeying the crown over their conscience. She nodded slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We are conscious of that fact, Grandmaster. But we serve Ailendamus. The Thirsting Veil is not as—detached as the Order of Seasons. A fact my fellow [Knights] and I have reflected on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In that they were tools of war to pursue conquest, not just defenders of the peace.&lt;/em&gt; Calirn and the other [Knights] nodded, hearing the words that would never be spoken aloud. It was as close to criticism as they would hear from Hevlca—her other [Knights] looked uneasy at even that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nevertheless. If war threatens, each Order must stand with its nation. Is there no chance Ailendamus' [King] will relent?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman's eyes flickered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Little. As it stands, the southern kingdoms have past quarrels with Ailendamus. And the northern kingdoms are disinterested in further conflicts. Their eyes turn to crusades abroad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;War with the Drakes, or Chandrar, or Baleros. &lt;/em&gt;Calirn grimaced. Terandria fought abroad; the Humans would unite against any invader, but they loved making colonies. Chandrar had been the last target and the King of Destruction had liberated Terandrian satellite nations. But Hevlca had no reason to lie. The other nations were more interested in attacking other species than curtailing Ailendamus' growing power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then Calanfer, Kaliv, and Gaiil-Drome will go to war against Ailendamus. And so will its [Knights]. Candidly—Pheislant has no reason to support Ailendamus and many reasons to oppose it. But I do not know if the Order of Seasons marches to war."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hevcla nodded, looking warily at Ser Dalimont. The Thronebearer was sizing her up as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It would be regrettable. But my Order is bound by our oaths."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As is mine, Dame Hevcla."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dalimont replied stiffly. Calirn sighed. He was trying to…mediate. It was of little use he knew, but something had to be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It seems we have more common enemies than each other, Dame Hevcla, Ser Dalimont. The King of Destruction. The Demons of Rhir. I would be &lt;em&gt;pleased&lt;/em&gt; if you could bear my thoughts back to your Grandmasters. At the very least, I ask that fewer [Knights] be sent to war. That we may have fewer occasions to mark such moments."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked pointedly towards the waiting [Knights] on the docks. Hevcla and Dalimont looked at Calirn. And both bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As you say, Grandmaster. Perhaps there is time for dialogue."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At least between the knightly orders. &lt;/em&gt;If they could agree to send less of their [Knights] to the frontlines, the war would be less bloody. Weaken each nation less. Calirn sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So much for diplomacy. He was a [Winter Knight], and far less suited to political maneuvering or flattery. He was, like Hevcla, straight to the point. She at least, appreciated that. The woman drew closer and Ser Dalimont stood back with the others for a moment as she murmured to Calirn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One hopes the war will be an empty clash soon followed by treaties and ransoms, Grandmaster Calirn. Or a lesser forfeit. But candidly—Ailendamus has been approaching Izril's Five Families for support. The Wellfar family for naval assistance—it is even rumored his Majesty may offer a lesser cousin of the throne's hand in marriage. In exchange for aid, of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Knight-Commander's brows snapped together. &lt;em&gt;Wellfar?&lt;/em&gt; Izril's nobility sometimes joined into Terandrian wars. If that was the case…Ailendamus wanted to &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt; this war, not just capture troops and some land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dire news, Dame Hevcla. Thank you for telling me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded. And in her eyes the knowledge that this might lead the Order of Seasons to oppose Ailendamus was forefront. But perhaps the Order of Thirsting Veils did not &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to see the three Terandrian kingdoms conquered. An empire was a terrible thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Honor and duty. That was a [Knight]'s life. She stepped back to her order after bowing. And then Ser Dalimont approached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You do us a service, Grandmaster Calirn. My order agrees this is…disadvantageous. We hope the Order of Seasons sees it the same way. Frankly speaking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As close to bluntness as he got. The Thronebearers &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be worried about war. Calirn nodded, and then Ser Dalimont offered his private words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Candidly, Grandmaster…my order is prepared for the worst. As is Calanfer. I too may not speak of my errands…but I soon depart via ship with one of my fellow [Knights] on a mission of great importance after we welcome our fallen. Calanfer would not wish—enemies—in this war from abroad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He had been listening in. &lt;/em&gt;Calirn looked at the man and Dalimont blushed. &lt;em&gt;Thronebearers&lt;/em&gt;. They played too much politics. Stiffly, Calirn looked at Hevcla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One would hope Calanfer pursues its goals with dignity, Ser Dalimont."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man's cheeks flamed. He bowed again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, Ser Calirn. I offer this information as—a token of trust. We too are exploring…alliances. But the waters are muddied."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Odd. Calanfer had two eligible [Princesses] they could marry off. As well as the lesser nobility. Unless—had the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; [Princess] remarried? But that still left one…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn's head hurt with the politics of it all. Still, Dalimont was giving the information in friendship. He nodded slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If Ailendamus should push—Pheislant will decide where it stands. Apart, perhaps, or with little aid. But the Order of Seasons will not let a sovereign nation fall so easily. That is all I may say."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, Grandmaster."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The relief that came from Dalimont was palpable. It was a dangerous pledge, Calirn knew, but he would never have changed his mind. The [Knight Commander] was about to ask Dalimont more, push for more information before the barge arrived—when he heard a &lt;em&gt;roar&lt;/em&gt; in the distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Queen of Pop had emerged from her carriage. She was…radiant. Her clothes, makeup, even the way she was poised as the wagon's doors opened and it slowed to let her step out and greet her fans—all of it spoke to a different world's culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this world was learning fast. People flooded forwards and were stopped by the line of [Bodyguards] hired to escort the famous singer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Excuse me! I'm a [Prince]! Singer! Miss Cara, it's me! Make way! Make—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Prince] of Pheislant wasn't getting through the crowd. The others were cheering wildly, asking to shake the [Singer] of Terandria's hand as she went across the crowd, doing just that, smiling, laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The air around her was electric. Personality, force of will—even people who didn't know the Singer of Terandria felt drawn to her, like metal to a magnet. She was laughing, excited, blowing kisses and talking with her audience as her fellow band members did the same. One of the young men with a guitar saw the [Baroness] and began talking with her as she stared at him with admiration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Outrageous."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ser Dalimont grimaced at the wild noise breaking the silence of the harbor. Calirn resisted the urge to clench his jaw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It didn't matter. The [Knights] had died and their honor wasn't tarnished by lack of attention. And yet—it did matter. Their sacrifice should not be overshadowed by…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He stood there, waiting for the ship to come in. And the [Popstar] brought the streets of Phel's Light to a standstill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"People, people! We'll be performing in thirty minutes! The Singer needs her privacy! Thank you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Manager] of the tour, a young woman from earth, bellowed into the crowd, her voice amplified by her Skill. They backed off—if only because it was true the wagons needed to set up. The Singer of Terandria had been given the largest plaza to perform in and the wagons were moving into it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Setting up so everyone could see her perform. The crews that came with her were experienced; they were already putting up a circular stage with bags of holding, and a pair of [Illusionists] were getting ready.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the main star and her band were all in a single wagon. Oh, they had special effects. Makeup. Props. But the song was the thing. And while the [Singer]'s crew moved around the wagons, getting ready, no one, absolutely &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; was allowed in the private wagon that belonged to the Queen of Pop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only her closest confidants were allowed in there. As the self-styled 'Queen of Pop' disappeared into her wagon with her band, a group of eight sighed and relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of them, the young man with a guitar, was protesting at the wagon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come on. Just a peek? She's a &lt;em&gt;[Baroness]. &lt;/em&gt;Just for a moment. Ask Cara if—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely not. You know the rules."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Manager] snapped back at the [Guitarist]. She smiled at the disappointed [Baroness] and her friends, who were clustered around the young man. His cheeks were flushed, but the [Ladies] dropped the matter first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We hope we can speak with the Singer later?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Baroness]'s friends looked at the young man with the guitar. He blushed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course! I'll make it happen. After the concert…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The noise faded as he climbed into the wagon. The entire vehicle was perfectly sealed against outside noise. It was also enchanted to be bigger on the inside than the outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There were even sofas, a kitchen in the back…it was a mobile base. Costly, but the Queen of Pop had bought it and renovated it. Now, the band relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were a band. Aside from the [Manager] and one young man from Argentina who was setting up their electronics—he had a pair of speakers connected to a laptop—the rest of the band had instruments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Drummer], a [Bassist], the lead guitar…each one of them had an instrument they could play. Or…pretend to play. After all, the songs were augmented by actual music from the laptop and speakers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But a few of them were actual musicians. The [Drummer] for instance, needed no help. He'd been an actual member of his band back from home. The [Guitarist]…? Not so much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Singer] was real, though. Before her band, she'd sung alone, with only karaoke music on an iPhone enhanced by a spell for backup. She had become the Queen of Pop, the beloved icon sweeping across Terandria, creating a wave of music and a new culture among young folk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As the door closed, the Singer smiled at the awestruck young [Ladies], her fans. Then the door shut. The [Manager] locked it. And the [Guitarist]—winced as the [Popstar]'s smile vanished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stop listenin' to the plámásing cunts thats yer wan I wouldn't let in here you stupid fook.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara O'Sullivan strode over and &lt;em&gt;poked&lt;/em&gt; the [Guitarist]—Greg—in the chest. Hard. She stopped smiling. And her natural accent—Irish—came out. The rest of the band…looked at each other, trying to figure out what she'd said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh—what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Greg blinked at the young woman. She was dressed like a star. Literally. Her dress &lt;em&gt;glittered&lt;/em&gt;. Sequins had been involved, heavily, and her makeup hid natural blemishes, gave her that look that was usually only attainable with illusion spells or image-editing software.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara calmed down. She looked around and her accent disappeared. She switched over to the voice everyone normally heard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A blend of American and British, heavier on the British side—very crisp, and quick. It was a disconcerting change. She smiled at Greg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I said—&lt;em&gt;stop listening to those flattering &lt;/em&gt;cunts&lt;em&gt;, you stupid fucking idiot. &lt;/em&gt;They don't come in here. No one does!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She snapped and the young man backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was just for a second, Cara—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shut it. You're a damn idiot, Greg."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah, shut the hell up, Greg."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Drummer], whose name was Thien, leaned over and scowled. He was Vietnamese. The others called out insults as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get laid somewhere &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;. And if you mess with those [Ladies] and one of them gets pregnant, her parents will have you killed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Manager] snapped. She was Nigerian. Almost every person in the wagon was from a different country; well, there were two people from Argentina. Cara nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know your job. You strum on that guitar and you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; cause trouble. We can replace you. If you try to show off in a guitar solo again or crowd-surf when &lt;em&gt;the guitar is still playing&lt;/em&gt; on the audio track, I will neuter you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She poked Greg in the chest. The young man backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey! I'm just trying to enjoy myself!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara made a disgusted noise. She stalked over to the sofa and sat down. She grabbed a glass of water and began to hydrate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This isn't about &lt;em&gt;enjoying&lt;/em&gt; yourself. This is a &lt;em&gt;job.&lt;/em&gt; We're not rockstars. And this isn't Earth. Greg, you're new, so you don't get it. I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a [Popstar]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's your class, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man paused uncertainly. Cara rolled her eyes. She jabbed a finger at her chest, taking care not to mess the dress as she reached out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where's the lyrics? Anyone?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here. These are our songs—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Singer] began to read as she spoke back, irritably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not a [Popstar]. I'm a damn &lt;em&gt;[Thespian].&lt;/em&gt; This is an &lt;em&gt;act.&lt;/em&gt; I have two classes. And as far as I'm concerned, I'm acting. I sing my songs—which are not mine—and we make money. But I don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; those idiots out there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded to the carriage. Cara paused, raised one finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And by those idiots, I mean that [Prince], our noble 'fans', and the monarchy. From Pheislant to Ailendamus—it's all [Kings] and [Queens]. We're in a feudal system and the rich stay on top."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Like home, you mean."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the others joked. Cara sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hate the social order that keeps people oppressed. I hate the nobility, the monarchy, and the poncing superior bastards like the [Knights] who step on smaller folk, even the nice ones. I hate feudality and hierarchy and all of this &lt;em&gt;shit.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around. And that was the [Singer] of Terandria. She had—opinions. Her band, all from Earth, looked at her. Greg sat in a corner and tried practicing on his guitar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Abebi, what's this I'm hearing about a…ship? Some kind of funeral?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Manager] grimaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, Cara. Apparently some of the dead [Knights] are coming back by ship today. Right as we're performing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fuck. Do we have to stop or something? Delay the concert?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the other exclaimed. Abebi shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. But the [Knights] aren't happy. [Prince]…whoever is in charge, though, so it's fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. Another fucking complication. I'll deal with it. Just follow my lead. No—Thien—listen up…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara thought out loud. And Thien and some of the older band members including their electronics expert, Nicolas, hurried over to confer. Because this band really was something of a front. They had been recruited, given roles. But the phenomenon that was the Singer of Terandria had started and stopped with Cara.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had been the one to find them. The one whose songs they'd heard and she had gathered them from across Terandria. They weren't even the only Earthers. There were others, just not travelling with the band.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Okay. Okay, that's the plan. If it doesn't work, it doesn't &lt;em&gt;work.&lt;/em&gt; But let's go with that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you sure? We haven't practiced playing on the move, Cara—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bassist] was worried as she checked her guitar. It was one from this world—enchanted to play louder and closer to an electric bass. She was also capable of playing it with most songs. Cara just nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Follow my lead. If you make mistakes, I'll cover for you. &lt;em&gt;Except if some idiot tries a shithead stunt!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She shouted and Greg ducked his head, turning red. Some of the others winced in sympathy for him; Cara was not kind when she was upset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I just don't get it, Cara. I know we're performing, but why try so &lt;em&gt;hard? &lt;/em&gt;We could do an hour's playing and walk off. You said it yourself; we are just making money. And looking around."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Irish [Singer] glared at Abebi. But she moderated her tone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Abebi. I mean every word I said. But did you see how many people came here? Forget that [Prince]; there's a city full of kids and people who came to see us. Who pay for tickets even if they don't have much. So when we bring it—when &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; go out there—I give it my all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at Cara. And they could see she was gearing up. The [Actor], the [Singer]—was wearing a look of utmost concentration as she read over the lyrics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was an interesting person, Cara. She'd found them. She was the highest-leveled among them. And she did have the [Pop Star] class, along with her second class—[Thespian]. The combined Skills and her ability to sing and channel their world's culture of stardom had given her this fame and comparative fortune. Everyone else rode on her coattails—if she'd worn them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alright, where's my plagiarism log?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone tossed it at her. Cara marked down which songs they were going to use. She kept a record of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why do you have that, Cara?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bassist], Rae, from France, asked. Cara glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It keeps me honest. Plus, if we ever get back to Earth—I can give something back. These aren't &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; songs, Rae. We're playing our world's best hits. That's why the 'Singer of Terandria' is the most famous person right now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was true. Cara had sung everything from modern pop hits that had come right out right when she'd been transported to this world to classics, like Sinatra's song, &lt;em&gt;My Way.&lt;/em&gt; And she &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm a bit nervous, Cara. I've only done this—four times."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rae confessed. She wasn't used to the crowds, and she was terrified of messing up. Her hands were shaking as she adjusted the guitar. Cara's face softened. She reached out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry, Rae. People have fucked it up before. I can cover for you all. If you're not sure, just &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; confident."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—I feel like a fake."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman confessed. Cara smiled crookedly. She took another gulp of water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's fine, Rae. We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; faking. Just pretend. My class—all of this is fake. You think I looked like &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;when I came here? Nah. I was chubby. I lost weight when I gained Skills. Even my face changed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gestured to her statuesque appearance. Rae's jaw dropped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely. You just stick with me. And we'll be fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Singer] smiled. And Rae, relieved, nodded. She stepped back. And as Cara stood up, her band looked at her. Thien, Nicolas, Rae—even Greg. The [Singer] turned her head; even through the soundproofed magic, she could hear a dull roar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ladies and gentlemen. Our audience is waiting. Let's not disappoint them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They drew inspiration from her. And as Cara threw open the door, she smiled. And it looked genuine. Maybe it was. She raised her hand and became the Queen of Pop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;People of Pheislant! I am &lt;/em&gt;delighted&lt;em&gt; you came out for me!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman's voice was audible across the city. People who didn't know what was happening looked up, as the screaming redoubled. Some of them grimaced. But the Queen of Pop didn't waste time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I'm honored. And I hope you'll listen to my little songs. My shining stars of Terandria.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what she called them. The Singer walked across her stage, waving as her band took their places. The [Illusionists] began to cast their spells. [Darkness], literally dimming the sun shining down from above. Amplifying the other instruments—although the [Singer] had a Skill of her own. Even a reverb in her voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Let's get this started with a classic.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Popstar] turned and pointed to Nicolas. He hit a button—and an electric piano began to play. The crowd cheered—then went silent. Rae began playing the chords on her guitar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that familiar song began to play. The Singer began to sing into the magical microphone she used. At the right moment, Greg broke in with his guitar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The music flooded Phel's Light. Loud enough that even the [Knights] on the deck, heard it, although too faintly for exact words. But the people not in the plaza looked up. And the music spoke to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A song from Earth. One of pop's greatest hits. Timeless, even if parts changed. A song about a boy and a girl on a train at midnight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara's voice rose, and the audience swayed back and forth, shouting as Greg took the center of the stage for his guitar. But the [Popstar] &lt;em&gt;shone—&lt;/em&gt;especially as the [Illusionists] conjured magical beams of light to follow her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From her position, watching, Abebi saw Rae nervously playing. Greg had no nerves, but he was restraining himself from showing off. That was, sadly, what made him so good in the band, despite his inability to actually &lt;em&gt;play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rest of the band was doing good. And Cara was as good as her word. She attracted the eye as she sang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course, the famed song by &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; was a hit. The audience had probably heard it on the magical crystals already. But that was the thing—the hit of the year and possibly the decade or century was the song the Singer of Terandria &lt;em&gt;opened&lt;/em&gt; with. And with just a short break, the next song began completely differently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A pair of backup [Singers], native Terandrians, grabbed the microphone. They joined Cara and two members of her band. And she disappeared behind a screen. Came out strutting. With a hat and casual suit. She grinned as Thien began to lay down a fast beat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time, the [Popstar] came out dancing. But she wasn't channeling the classic 'King of Pop' from her world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bruno Mars…&lt;/em&gt;check."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Abebi made a note on her clipboard. They'd already done a lot of classics, so they kept on adding new songs in. Different performances so the crowd always had something new, even if they were repeat viewers, like the [Prince].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara insisted. She cared about her audience, for all she claimed to hate the act. You could never tell, seeing her on stage, channeling all the showmanship into her dancing and singing with her crew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The audience was going nuts. The [Illusionists] had to cast a blanket [Silence] spell just to give the music the volume it needed. &lt;em&gt;Uptown Funk&lt;/em&gt; was new—they'd be selling the magical crystals after the show.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Abebi—that thing you wanted to watch out for. The ship's coming in!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the stagehands whispered to Abebi as the Singer of Terandria launched into another song she'd taken from home. Abebi cursed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Already? &lt;/em&gt;Fine—I'll get to Cara. Get ready! Tell the [Illusionists]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hurried to the side of the stage. The [Bodyguards], keeping the others back, saw Abebi and let her through. Cara noticed—somehow—and held up a hand after she finished her next song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;One moment, please!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;We might have another new song for you all!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She leaned down and Abebi shouted up to her above the roar of the crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The ship's coming in!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara's eyes sharpened. The Singer of Terandria rose. And she nodded at Thien.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hit it, Thien. &lt;em&gt;My lovely stars! We have something new this time! If you'll follow me—we have somewhere we need to be.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Thien left his drumset. He grabbed another drum. Terandria had a lot of the instruments that Earth did. Not the same, but close. No pianos, which is what Cara wanted, along with some brass instruments and electronics, obviously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they had drums for war. Cara looked at the rest of the band. Rae jumped. She left the stage as the audience, confused, looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Somewhere to be?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then the [Singer] began to sing. And Thien grabbed the drum and a large, rounded mallet. He hooked the drum to his front. Because he wasn't using a normal drum, a &lt;em&gt;drumline.&lt;/em&gt; And he began a rhythmic beat that went through the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara motioned, and her backup singers nodded. She pointed, and Thien stepped &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; the stage. The [Bodyguards] fought to clear them a path, but the [Singer] cleared the path herself. Her audience moved back as she walked with her band, following Thien.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were playing a marching song. &lt;em&gt;Marchin On&lt;/em&gt;—to the beat, as the [Singer] began to walk out of the plaza. And her audience followed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Knight-Commander Calirn was in a poor mood. The music in the background had been echoing for a good fifteen minutes. And—while some of the [Spring Knights] had begun tapping their feet surreptitiously to the music, it was noise from this far away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And now—the funeral barge was incoming. And the music was still playing. The [Knight Commander] closed his eyes. The other [Knights] were shifting, looking at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was even growing &lt;em&gt;louder&lt;/em&gt;. Calirn's brows twitched. He was about to demand a [Silence] spell from his Knights of the Autumn, as disgraceful as that would be. When he heard a voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Knight-Commander! &lt;em&gt;Look!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Knight Zidele pointed. And Calirn turned his head as the distant ship drifted into the harbor. He heard a female voice, joined by a few others, singing energetically. To the beat of a heavy drum he felt in his &lt;em&gt;boots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why is that music growing—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He snapped, and then stopped. Because the Singer of Terandria walked into the harbor. And behind her—came the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The marching band stopped. And the audience the Queen of Pop had lured out of the plaza halted, piling onto the harbor front, around the crews. The [Knights] turned and &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at the thousands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And there was the Queen of Pop. The catchy, pop song stopped as the beating drum trailed off. Some people began to cheer—but she lifted a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she had an aura. As strong as Calirn had ever seen in a [Singer]. The Singer raised her hand—and her fans, her audience, saw the black barge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They fell silent as it drifted into the harbor. The [Knights] turned. And they saw the ship and knelt. Knight-Commander Calirn bowed as Ser Raim returned home. And out of the corner of his eye, he saw the Singer of Terandria copy the gesture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She knelt. Her audience saw her take a knee and followed suit, awkwardly. They bowed, or knelt, and realized what was happening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Knights of the Seasons. Let the Season of Summer welcome our fallen brethren."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn's voice was suddenly the only sound in the silence. The people of Phel's Light, tens of thousands, looked on. Suddenly somber. Gazing upon the [Knights] as they were brought from the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It shouldn't matter. Not really. But it did. Calirn saw the ashes brought forth. He bowed his head as the [Knights] walked, bearing their comrade. They turned—and the tens of thousands parted slowly. Allowing them room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was the largest gathering for such a moment Calirn could remember since the war against the Drakes as a child. He saw the Queen of Pop, the Singer, bowing her head. And he nodded to her, all of his objections forgotten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In silence, the [Knights] escorted their own through the silent city. Greg, Rae, Abebi—all the others saw Cara kept her head bowed, until the [Knights] had long since passed by.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Cara. I thought you didn't like the [Knights]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Greg looked completely confused. Cara turned her head as the moment of quietus passed. She whispered back, so quietly only the Earthers heard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't. But those brave lads died far from home, trying to do the right thing as they saw it. So if you can't respect that, grab a rope, tie it around your neck, and go jump off a chair. 'Cause if you don't, I'll do it for you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then she straightened. And she called out softly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, people of Phel's Landing. Let's go back. This next song is for bravery."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned and walked back. The [Violinist] took up his bow and began to play as the Singer of Terandria walked, singing softly across the city. And the [Knights] listened, for the song was meant for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the Queen of Pop. Calirn saw his [Knights] bearing Ser Raim away. He would meet them at the monastery. But he lingered for a bit. To listen to the [Singer] he thought he'd misjudged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The average length of a concert from Cara's world was two to three hours. Shorter, depending on the material. But the Singer of Terandria had a surfeit of music. Nor—did she quit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Four hours later, Cara was still singing. She let one of her backups—a native Terandrian man, a [Bard]—take over for a few songs as she gulped a stamina potion and then a healing one for her throat. But she kept going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think it's time for the big reveal. Get into costumes, everyone. One last set of songs. And we're done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Singer] looked at her exhausted band. They looked up. And Thien grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The last song by the [Bard] was met with cheers, but people were demanding the Queen of Pop. For one last song. The curtains were lowered, but the [Singer]'s voice was audible behind it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;My shining stars. You've stayed with me for song after song. But for tonight—we're going to change things up. With a new song—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wild cheering. She &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; had a new song. The voice paused and went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;—in a new &lt;/em&gt;style. This one's for you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The curtains rose. And the audience, cheering, saw the [Singer] standing on the stage. The cheers faltered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara's hair was swept back. It was dyed black, made spikey with hair gel. Her makeup had been changed to make her features even paler, and black eye shadow emphasized her eyes and lips. The [Prince] of Pheislant, the noble fans—stared. The [Singer] adjusted the black jacket. And her band, dressed in another style from her world began to play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The music was more urgent. A piano played as the [Singer] began to croon into the microphone. At first, people began to nod along to the music, move their legs. But that wasn't quite—appropriate. This wasn't pop. This was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Thien brought his drumsticks down hard and the audience &lt;em&gt;jumped. &lt;/em&gt;The backup singers shouted into their microphones. And Cara's voice went lower. Growling. &lt;em&gt;Screaming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calirn almost clapped his hands over his ears. He saw an excited fan pointing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's doing it again! It's &lt;em&gt;rock!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rock?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Popstar] became a rock-star. She laughed, eyes wide, channeling a completely different sort of energy. Some of her fans recoiled. But the rest began to cheer wildly and the world's &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; mosh pit began evolving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rock. Pop&lt;/em&gt;. The [Singer] signed off to wild cheers, people shouting for an encore. The air around her was electric and her [Bodyguards] had to work for their gold to get the cast into the wagon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some didn't make it. Greg was swept away by groupies—mostly of his own volition. Rae was left behind as well. Abebi made it into the wagon with Cara—that was what mattered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get everyone else to their wagons. If they go out—make sure they have someone &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara croaked. Her makeup had run from sweat. The other band members were grinning, swept up on the adrenaline. The concert had been madly successful—even by their standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can do, Cara. That was &lt;em&gt;wild.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They left, some of them to their wagons to sleep or rest—others to enjoy their accolades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Popstar] didn't go out. She rested on the sofa, sweating, panting. Abebi looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you okay, Cara?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Like a fucking fiddle. Just grand, Abebi. Give me a moment. And pass me some of that &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;, will you? We got any ice cream?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The costly gelato was in a box of ice. Abebi passed it to Cara and some of the preserved food. The [Singer] began to scarf the food without hesitation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Careful. You'll burst out of your dress."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Manager] was only half-teasing. Cara grabbed an entire meat pie made by the best [Baker] in Phel's Light and began to eat it in huge bites. She shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry about me, Abebi. I don't ever put on weight. Never have. I can eat and it all burns away."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman from Nigeria frowned. That seemed—off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Didn't you tell Rae that you used to be fat before you gained your class?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara blinked. The young Irish woman looked up. She thought, and then replied casually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, that. I lied."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Abebi's mouth fell open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you said—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Actor] sighed and stretched out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I tell people what they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to hear, Abebi. That's my job. Rae needed the confidence. So as long as &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;don't tell her, she'll be fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Manager] fell silent. Cara glanced at her sidelong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Abebi. I'm acting. This—class. [Popstar]? I mean what I said. It's just a class to make money. I don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; pop songs. I sing them because it's the most accessible music."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that why you had us play rock?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara had pushed for that, 'revealing' more of her personality and giving them a new genre. It had stunned some fans, but the genre of rock was just as important. The [Singer] smiled crookedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What makes you think I like rock?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Abebi's mouth opened and closed. She looked at Cara again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara didn't reply at first. Wearily, she passed a hand over her face. Smearing the makeup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Abebi. You've known me longest. So I'm going to tell you this. Once. All of this is a mask."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed at her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mask. And below that's another mask. Because we're not &lt;em&gt;safe.&lt;/em&gt; I pretend to be the flashy Singer of Terandria because we need &lt;em&gt;money.&lt;/em&gt; The others need it to live, I need it to buy artifacts, that replacement inhaler for Desmond—we need money. And that's why we're touring."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To find the best place to settle. I know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Abebi nodded. Cara did too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Terandria's safest. So it seems. But no kingdom's perfect. And nowhere is &lt;em&gt;safe. &lt;/em&gt;We're being…hunted. We need allies. Those [Knights]? Maybe we can trust them. We need to trust someone. Because I'm just a [Pop Star]. I can't protect us if push comes to shove."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you're the highest-leveled among us! By far! You're Level &lt;em&gt;40.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara had hit that level last month. The [Singer] smiled crookedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So what? Abebi. You think if Wistram tries to arrest us, we'll get away?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The audience &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; you! Can't you hear them out there? A [Prince] wants to marry you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fuck him. Our fans will turn on us. I'm a &lt;em&gt;celebrity&lt;/em&gt;, Abebi. A star. I shine—and then I'm forgotten in a year or two. We make the money we can, find good allies. Maybe Ailendamus. We back the winning horse. But we need &lt;em&gt;help.&lt;/em&gt; Do you think I can stop a nation? Tell me—when has a celebrity changed &lt;em&gt;anything?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She sat there, smiling cynically at Abebi. The [Manager] hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you sure? You've been so worried—why not go with those Wistram [Mages]? That Blackmage person?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara grimaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I got a letter back from Elena the other day. Want to see it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You &lt;em&gt;did?&lt;/em&gt; Why didn't you tell us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Abebi eagerly took the letter. It was from Elena! She had volunteered to go to Wistram. Abebi read through it. It was filled with talk of Wistram. Aaron and the magical experiments—encouraging the others to join her. Her face—froze. Abebi looked up from the letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It—this is from Elena, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. And we have some of those [Mages] following us. Keep asking to speak to me, to &lt;em&gt;escort&lt;/em&gt; us to Wistram. All nine of us. Which means Elena hasn't told them about the others. Good thing we switched the hiding place, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Thespian] leaned back, sighing. Abebi read the letter again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She didn't use any of the passphrases we came up with."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No shit?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cara covered her face. Elena had been given a number of innocuous expressions she'd work into correspondence if everything was okay. That they weren't there meant it wasn't. The [Singer] spoke bitterly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a trap. I knew it. They're probably keeping her hostage. She can't leave. Fuck those Illuminati-[Mage] cunts and their academy. And thanks to that jackass—blackmage—they're onto &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;. Don't share that, Abebi. I'll tell the others after this tour."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Nigerian [Manager] nodded palely. She put the letter down, hands shaking. Cara went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's Plan C or Plan G. We have to get with someone who'll back us. Who can resist Wistram and…that's all. That's why we're doing this. That's why the &lt;em&gt;masks. &lt;/em&gt;Abebi. You all don't even know my real name."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Abebi. The smiling [Singer], the bitter pragmatist—which one was real? Abebi looked at Cara.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not Cara O'Sullivan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a second, the [Actor] stared at her. And Abebi saw her face, blankly staring. Unmoving. Then the [Thespian] smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course it is. That part's a lie. Come on. I want to see if one of those [Knights] stuck around."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Abebi sighed in relief. And Cara rose. The [Singer] of Terandria left the wagon to raucous cheers. Protecting her people. She smiled, putting on another mask.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she was unreadable. Unscryable. She murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fuck it all. Where are you, 'batman'? I could use someone else to help me out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Singer of Terandria was changing the continent. The world. Through song. She was already rich. Famous. But she was a [Singer].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was no ruler. She had a lot of [Bodyguards].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not an army. Perhaps the Queen of Pop had an army of fans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Ailendamus had an army equipped with armor and blades. And their ruler, His Glorious Majesty Itorin II, had ambitious plans. Glorious designs for the future of his kingdoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Terrible ones for his enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was reaching out to other nations, laying the groundwork for aggression. War between Terandrian kingdoms was not like other wars. They followed rules. Protocols, traditions—as important as law. Treaties were held sacred, pacts between kingdoms that could not be violated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Until someone broke them, with a Skill, or with pure arrogance and might. One was broken now, along the northern border of the Kingdom of Kaliv.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kaliv, the kingdom of mountains, small in total landmass, but occupying the mountains. A power of the region. But hungry for farmland, food to feed the [Griffin Riders] and giant rams they used and bred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A grassland along the Tergil River had been used as one of Kaliv's larger farms. It had been taken in a war, oh, two hundred years back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Now, a party of [Mercenaries] led by a [Sword Captain] of Ailendamus set upon the village and farm. They moved fast, herding up the Level 34 [Farmer] and most of the people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;By order of his Majesty Itorin II of Ailendamus, this land is forfeit!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sword Captain] bellowed. The [Farmer] protested, shouting as the fresh-harvested food was dragged out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can't do this! This is Kaliv's land! It was taken in war and ratified by Treaty of Everdel! Her Majesty—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sword Captain] struck the [Farmer], knocking him back. The [Mercenaries] were fiddling with oil, flint and tinder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ailendamus does not recognize that treaty any longer. &lt;/em&gt;Men! &lt;em&gt;Eradicate this illegal farm.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] paled. The [Mercenaries] were setting fire to the silos, the crops. If they burned it all, Kaliv would feel the pinch. Especially in war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can't do this! When the Griffin Queen—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sword Captain] leveled his sword. The [Farmer] froze as his family tried to pull him back. The leader of the [Mercenaries] glanced at the burning barn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't make this harder, sir. We need not spill your blood today. This is just politics between kingdoms."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spoke curtly. The [Farmer] looked at the armed [Mercenaries] on horseback, the sword held by the high-level [Warrior], and wilted. The [Farmers] groaned as the flames began to lick up one silo. They were going to transport that food up the mountains! As King Itorin had surely known. That was enough food to feed the mountain-cities for a month!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sword Captain] was glancing about. Even if the Griffin Queen, Novakya, sent her fliers, they would be away and racing through the forests before they could be caught. And the fire just needed to burn—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Enough!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice bellowed from above. The people on the ground looked up. The [Mercenaries] and their horses shouted in confusion as a blast of wind hit the burning buildings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The fire flared—and then went out. The [Sword Captain] swore as, from overhead, dark shadows dropped out of the sky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Six Griffins and their riders landed in front of the mercenary company of thirty riders or so. And in front of them, the one who had called out, was a man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was in his late twenties. And the [Farmer] and family of Kaliv gasped when they saw him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Griffin Prince.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The famed disgrace of Kaliv. The [Prince] who had been banished, never to return to his home city. That he had returned once in recent memory, dying, as the Stitch Witch was nearly ended—was almost unknown outside of Kaliv's royal court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;To everyone else, he was only The Griffin Prince. His name had been stricken. To say it was anathema.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he was still a [Prince] of Kaliv. And he roamed the border. The [Sword Captain] cursed as he backed up. He'd been afraid of just this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stay back! By order of his Majesty—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"King Itorin does not rule here. Take your men and go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Griffin Prince] thundered. He was physically fit, a warrior, armed with a long spear for use from Griffin-back. He, like the other five accompanying him, were also armed with bows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Griffin Riders]. One of them, a young woman, had her bow drawn and was aiming it at the [Sword Captain]'s face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lily. Lower your bow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Griffin Prince snapped at her. He dismounted, as the Royal Griffin, largest of its kind, snapped at the horses. But there were only six Griffins and their riders and the mercenaries outnumbered them five-to-one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were high-level. So was the [Sword Captain]. He advanced in a careful walk, on the balls of his feet. His sword was held at the ready.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We obey only his Majesty, [Prince] of Kaliv. This farm will be burned. Stand aside or die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lily. Or Lillian Woods, saw the [Sword Captain] tense. She had the arrow in her bow, ready to draw and fire. But the Griffin Prince had signaled her to stand down. She could feel the other [Griffin Riders] tense as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman was ready to attack. Her Griffin was too. She had killed people in this world before. Learned how to shoot a bow. But she'd known what that felt like a long time before that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was a [Murderer]. And then a [Bandit]. Now—she was a [Griffin Raider], flying in the Griffin Prince's escort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But The Griffin Prince was the one on the ground. He had an axe for combat in close quarters. Now, he drew it, and the buckler he carried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have sworn never to let an enemy despoil Kaliv. If you do not retreat, my warriors and I will cut you all down. This is your last warning."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We refuse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sword Captain] sneered. The [Mercenaries] were tensed, ready for action. So were the [Griffin Riders]. But the two leaders were closest. The Griffin Prince tensed as the [Farmers] drew back. The [Sword Captain] narrowed his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Prince] charged with a roar. His axe came up. The young man was &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; and fast. But the [Sword Captain] had surpassed Level 30 eight years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He dodged like quicksilver. His sword lanced out and The Griffin Prince blocked the tip of the sword, knocking it aside with the buckler. He staggered, cut as he stepped back. The [Sword Captain] slashed twice, impossible quick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. His Majesty's outclassed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lily heard another of the riders curse. The Griffin Prince blocked one strike, but the second slashed him down the side. His blood ran through his leather armor, which had parted before the magic weapon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Murderer] snapped. The other riders looked at her, but they held still. The [Prince] checked himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was good. Not that the [Sword Captain] wasn't winning, but the [Prince] had an innate sense of battle. The [Sword Captain] was twice as fast as he was, but The Griffin Prince's skill with his axe and buckler was learned from combat experience. He managed to deflect another slash just based on the other man's posture. The [Prince] charged in and the [Captain] cursed, unprepared for the bold move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get him!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Griffin Riders] roared as The Griffin Prince slashed with the axe. The [Sword Captain]'s eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Flicker Step]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He vanished out of the way. The [Prince] pursued. The [Sword Captain] gritted his teeth. He stepped back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"[Blade Art: Eighteen Silverfish]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man brought up his buckler with a curse. The other man's blade blurred. And the lancing cuts struck at the [Prince]. But he'd dodged back just out of range; the tips of the sword cut into his body, drawing blood, but shallowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Still, the Griffin Prince staggered. And the [Sword Captain] saw his chance. He leapt forwards, body flickering. His Skills enhanced his movement. His sword came up, enhanced again by Skills and magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Decapitation Slice].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A second Skill. It could be dodged, but the cut was perfect. The Griffin Prince jerked backwards—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His head hit the ground. The body fell. The [Sword Captain] heard the Griffin Riders fall silent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Farmer] and his family screamed in shock. The [Sword Captain] staggered. He must have—taken the [Prince] by surprise. Panting, he whirled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But The Griffin Prince's escort was frozen in shock. The [Captain] laughed shakily. He turned to the [Mercenaries].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Send word to his Majesty. The Griffin Prince of Kaliv is dead! He—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man saw one of the [Mercenaries] go white. He spun. And then the [Sword Captain]'s blood froze in his veins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had cut the [Prince]'s head off. He &lt;em&gt;had.&lt;/em&gt; But the body was standing back up. And the head was back on his shoulders. Red gore was visible from inside; skin and bone had been cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it was reattaching itself. &lt;/em&gt;Black thread was stitching the wound closed. And the young man's head was &lt;em&gt;looking &lt;/em&gt;at the [Sword Captain].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sadly. The black thread sewed the gaping wound closed. And then disappeared, becoming flesh. The Griffin Prince grimaced, wincing with the pain. And he shook his head. His voice was somber as he gestured at the [Captain]'s crimson blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Brave warrior. You will need a better blade than that to free me from my curse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He walked forwards slowly. The man from Ailendamus went white. His surefootedness was suddenly gone. He stumbled backwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Monster.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] whispered it. He had heard rumors. But &lt;em&gt;this?&lt;/em&gt; He looked at his sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's magical. I &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt; you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Weak magic. My sin runs deeper than that. Now. Put up your sword and surrender. Or die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sword Captain] hesitated. Then he closed his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Men! Kill them!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Mercenaries] hesitated. But the Griffins screamed and attacked. There was nowhere to run. Lily aimed her bow, shot one [Mercenary] from the saddle. Then she drew a spear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Up! &lt;em&gt;Knives&lt;/em&gt;, up! Dive!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Knives, her Griffin, flew upwards, and the five [Griffin Riders] dove at the [Mercenaries] who shot arrows and spells upwards. The Griffin Prince's mount fought on the ground, shielding the [Farmers].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the [Prince] and the [Sword Captain] fought a second time. This time the [Warrior] used all of his Skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Flash Cut]! [Flicker Step]! [Sword Art—].&lt;em&gt; Die, damn you!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Prince] charged into him. He wasn't using any Skills! He just—&lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; battle. More than the [Sword Captain], who was nearly a decade his elder. He took a cut across the face, but kept coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fearless, ignoring the pain. Lily saw The Griffin Prince cutting, slashing with controlled attacks at the [Sword Captain]. Using skill, combat experience against Skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another cut actually bisected him along his right shoulder. But the black thread sewed the [Prince] together. He came on. Wearing the [Sword Captain] down by cuts, forcing him backwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because The Griffin Prince had no Skills to use. He could die. Be defeated. His resurrection took time. An enemy could blind him, keep hacking him apart. But the [Prince] was experienced. He had been fighting since he was a child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He caught the [Sword Captain] at last. The man dodged back too slow. The buckler stunned him. The [Prince]'s axe hacked deep into where neck met shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man fumbled for a healing potion. But the cut was mortal. He fell, choking, as The Griffin Prince gave him no chance to rise. The axe fell twice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dead. The [Mercenaries] saw-felt the [Captain] die. They fled. They'd been hacked apart by the superior [Griffin Riders]. Despite the disparity in numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;After them!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lily shouted. The Griffin Prince raised one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Let them leave. Ailendamus is provoked enough. Let them go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was panting. The other [Griffin Riders] grumbled. The [Prince] pulled himself upright. He looked around tiredly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The girl from Earth heard a sound. The [Farmer] and his family were staring at the damned [Prince]. He turned to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you al—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They fled, screaming. And why not? They had &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; him die. Seen the curse, laid on him when he was a boy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Griffin Prince's shoulder slumped. Lily spat after the group that had fled. So did the other [Griffin Riders].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ungrateful bastards. But for us, Kaliv would've lost its grain. Should we loot some? Or burn the fields ourselves, boss?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One scarred man leaned out of his saddle. The Griffin Prince looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. We fly. Take nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The former [Marauder] grimaced. But he, like Lily, did not object to the orders. They followed the [Prince] willingly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they flew, through the sky. Following their cursed, exiled [Prince]. Lillian flew after the man who had tracked down the [Bandit] group she'd joined. Who'd refused to &lt;em&gt;die.&lt;/em&gt; And who had offered her redemption or death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Griffin Prince of Kaliv. The shame of the royal family. The boy who had made a pact with a [Witch], for his very soul. The exile who defended his lands until he could find his death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With him flew a [Murderer]. A [Marauder]. A &lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"&gt;[Rapist]&lt;/span&gt;. Disgraced [Knights]. People beyond redemption. Cowards and killers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kaliv's Wing of Shame. They were offered one last chance. So they spent their lives in battle. And Lillian Woods was among them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm tired, Lily. Tell me a story from your home. Another fantastical story."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all The Griffin Prince said after they returned to their hidden base. The young Canadian woman smiled crookedly. She looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A man grown. More honorable than any other 'noble' despite his curse. Dedicated to defending his home even when no one would offer him more than insults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—a boy still. Unchanged from the day he had made a mistake and been cursed—blessed—&lt;em&gt;changed&lt;/em&gt; by the most powerful [Witch] in this world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was a [Prince], yes. A Level 6 [Prince]. And he looked at Lily as he closed his eyes. Seeking his end. Seeking word of the Stitch Witch, that he might be freed. If war came, The Griffin Prince would fly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he could never die. Lillian Woods had tried to convince him to leave his self-appointed guardianship. To seek his enemy. But he had refused. He loved her fantastical stories. Even if he didn't believe them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all—fine. If he did not believe, she would find the Stitch Witch. And free the [Prince] from his dark curse. Lillian laughed as she tended to Knives and then went to find him. She was a heroine in another, fantasy story. What a strange world this was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But so much better than home. And if she couldn't kill Belavierr, the immortal, she'd settle for the girl who'd tricked him. The girl The Griffin Prince loved—still loved. The daughter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wiskeria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">495659</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 02:59:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - Interlude – A Night in the Inn</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/494285</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have a new enemy. A name, among the countless species. Magnolia Reinhart."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn spoke calmly to the images of the assembled Queens. Her voice was controlled, but her eyes belied her true state. Darkness crossed each of the colors. Black fury.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Klbkch stood by Xrn's side. Marveling. Not at her, or the unrest of the other Queens. Xrn &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; calm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No—he was simply astounded by a new kind of war. One with not a single drop of blood spilled, but had done more damage than even a hundred [Siege Fireballs] might. That woman—that [Lady] had reached into the Hive and unearthed terrible secrets. Their numbers, their fortifications, the true extent of the Free Antinium's Hive. The tunnel leading south—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everything. And she had managed it because the [Ladies] fought in ways that drew not blood you could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;. But Klbkch, a master of blades, felt cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 204, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What will happen next, Xrn? You assured me your presence would bring only &lt;em&gt;benefit &lt;/em&gt;to the Hives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Grand Queen snapped. Xrn leaned on her staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We must take precautions, see what the Drake's response will be, my Queen. And mark her. Like Zel Shivertail, I ask that the Hives agree to designate Magnolia Reinhart an entity of maximum threat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Queens stirred. But none objected. The Silent Queen spoke, thoughtfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(204, 153, 255, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So she is among my Hive's targets if we go to war."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Silent Antinium, including Xeu, moved slightly. Their targets were marked across Izril.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you object, my Queen?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn bowed. The Silent Queen raised one feeler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(204, 153, 255, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. It shall be done. The Silent Antinium agree."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(153, 153, 153, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That woman withstood two of our Centenium. The Armored Antinium designate her a threat, in the past and now. Let this Magnolia Reinhart never rally to the Drake's defense a third time. We agree."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Armored Queen turned her massive head. The Flying Queen, smaller, rubbed her feelers together anxiously; her Hive rustled around her, mirroring her mood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What strange classes, [Ladies] are. To use such Skills. Can she employ such in war?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If. She can. Wrymvr will slay. Her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Twisted Queen's halting speech was last of all. Klbkch saw her turn towards him, looking past the Free Queen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Klbkchhezeim. Wrymvr wishes. To speak to you. It would please the Twisted. Antinium. For you to visit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn's head rose. She looked at Klbkch, cautiously. The other Antinium folded his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wrymvr of the Centenium.&lt;em&gt; Wrymvr the Deathless,&lt;/em&gt; the other races named him. And his name was most fitting of all the Centenium they had met. Xrn wanted to speak, but she held her voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Klbkch bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It may be suitable, Twisted Queen. I can make no promises."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 204, 0, 1); font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then it is agreed. Magnolia Reinhart is marked. Now tell me Xrn. How were you unable to stop this…[Druid]? We encountered that class seldom. Speak. And what will happen to the Free Antinium now? Are we…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Grand Queen spoke impatiently, and the Queens debated. And elsewhere in Izril, the Walled Cities were in conference. Arguing, trying to understand both the information they had been given and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they had been given it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart of the Five Families. An enemy of the Drakes—or rather, her family had been. An ally?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a party scheduled in Oteslia soon. And suddenly—it was even more important than it had been. People marveled. At Magnolia Reinhart's information network, the audacity of her move, to confront Antinium directly, at the unnerving actions of the Antinium—even distant figures like the Blighted King paid attention to an old foe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Look at her, Magnolia Reinhart. And that dress. Fashion and spectacle and treachery and Skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And while the rest of the world heaved—the inn that had been used by Magnolia Reinhart was bubbling. No—burning with what had happened. And you might hate it, or approve of what had happened. But forget about the world for a moment. The world was sometimes a stupid place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In The Wandering Inn, that night, many faces, new and old met and mingled. And—that young woman, that [Innkeeper], Erin Solstice. Her place had been used by Magnolia Reinhart. And she was sorely hurt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet, the night was more than Magnolia Reinhart. One by one, they arrived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Guests. Old friends. New people, stumbling in, looking around, wide-eyed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wandering Inn had come to Invrisil. What event. What chaos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Magnolia had overshadowed it. Used the inn harshly, like a piece on a larger chessboard. It was unsettling. And so—at first, they came in like visitors to a wake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria Springwalker walked into The Wandering Inn. She still felt—stunned. The [Ladies] had swept through the Players of Celum's inn. And Ceria had just watched them moving—only when they'd gone had she ceased to be a member of the audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A young woman was sitting in a chair. And—Ceria had thought of her friend often. But Erin looked unfamiliar, for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Older. Tired. Sadder, staring down at her clasped hands. Like—someone overburdened, and young. Not the force of personality and goodwill she normally was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reminded Ceria of Erin before Skinner, a young woman who did her best, but hadn't been &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Crazy Human of Liscor. For a moment. Then, hearing the half-Elf's voice, she raised her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ceria…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette stirred. The [Princess] was holding Mrsha, at a loss for words. But both looked at Ceria. And the half-Elf raised one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi. Um—we made it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She didn't know what to say, but Erin's head rose. And she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You did. Ceria!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She rose to her feet, slowly. But she walked over and gave Ceria a big hug. The [Cryomancer] felt Erin squeezing, and hugged back. For a moment, Erin just leaned on Ceria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. I had no idea that Lady Magnolia Reinhart would—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"S'okay. I don't think anyone did. She just—hey, Ceria. Where've you been? And the others?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin raised her head tiredly. And behind Ceria was Yvlon, Ksmvr, and Pieces, all standing in the inn. Behind them were the young people they'd just met, the Players of Celum—the door flickered out as Grev ran through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone was just watching, though. Erin Solstice looked so &lt;em&gt;tired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mortally tired. She'd thrown everything she had against the three [Ladies]. And she hadn't stopped a thing. It wasn't just physical exhaustion, it was mental, spiritual. Ceria saw Erin looking around, blinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yvlon? Pisces. Ksmvr. Is that—Wesle and Jasi? E-Emme? Kilkran? Grev? Where did you all come from?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We've been eager to see you, Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jasi spoke hesitantly. The others nodded, but the mood was somber. Erin Solstice smiled, but it wasn't that glorious &lt;em&gt;look, &lt;/em&gt;that picked you up on your darkest day and said that everything would be alright. It was just a curve of the lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] had lost. And she was so tired. And the [Innkeeper] was her inn. Ceria felt Erin straightening, but she held her friend, as if Erin might fall down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In that moment, even the [Actors] didn't know what to say. They could pretend everything was alright, but it was so clearly not. The adventurers? Yvlon looked around at the inn and shook her head. Ksmvr was opening and closing his mandibles uncertainly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Who could say something? And what would it be? Ceria didn't know—but then she saw, out of the corner of her eye, one of Erin's oldest friends moving. Because of course, he had been there way back when.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, Pisces looked around. The [Necromancer] found a chair in the silent inn. And, as Drakes and Gnolls and guests from Invrisil looked at him, he sat down. And then he leaned back, precariously perching on the back two legs of the chair. And he put his feet up on the tabletop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces &lt;em&gt;sniffed&lt;/em&gt;, and looked at Erin. And his voice was mock-acerbic and mostly kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I expect &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt;, Miss Innkeeper. Pasta and blue juice, if you please. For me and my team."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman and Ceria looked at Pisces. Ceria opened her mouth, and saw Erin's face. The young woman sniffed. And if she'd been close to tears—they were gone when she put her hands on her hips and glared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You again?&lt;/em&gt; You'd better have some money."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces ostentatiously slapped a few coins on the table. And he smiled at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If the food is good, I suppose I could give you a &lt;em&gt;tip.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Erin Solstice laughed. Like a normal person, but her eyes lit up. She looked around her inn, at her old friends. And they smiled. Erin inhaled, and looked about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. We've got guests. Lyonette, do we have any food left? Get something for Mister Necromancer here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] rolled her eyes. But she was smiling. Mrsha leapt out of her arms and tackled Ceria's legs. The half-Elf hadn't been expecting that. She went over with a &lt;em&gt;crash.&lt;/em&gt; Yvlon winced. Ksmvr hurried over to help her out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Pisces began laughing. So did Erin. And the inn came alive. More people laughed, and Ceria, getting up, saw Erin turning. The [Innkeeper] breathed in and out. And then she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wasn't over it. But she had guests, so Erin put the feelings away for a bit. And The Wandering Inn began to shine again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn, the door's out of mana again. Are the Sage's Grass not working right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Palt grumbled as he trotted over. Ceria looked up and saw Montressa holding out a slow hand. Ceria took it, unthinking, and Montressa helped haul her up. Bezale was standing next to her, arms folded. She grunted at Yvlon and the [Armsmistress] nodded slowly back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As the others began chatting, Ceria saw Numbtongue reaching behind the bar for a drink with Bird. A love struck Belgrade was still standing where he had been.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So pretty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pawn was hurrying after Lyonette. And the Players of Celum were looking around. Temile made a choked sound and began to push towards Wesle and Jasi. Ceria realized Maviola was missing. Still in Invrisil?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And at that moment, one of the young people looked at Pisces and exclaimed. Kevin pointed at Pisces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dude. He's a&lt;em&gt; [Necromancer]?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone turned to look at Pisces. And the [Necromancer] stiffened. But Kevin promptly turned to his friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's so &lt;em&gt;cool.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The first few minutes afterwards were full of chaos. Erin was surrounded by the Horns of Hammerad, who she was hugging and talking to. But then she looked up and her eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. &lt;em&gt;Halrac's here?&lt;/em&gt; And Revi and Typhenous?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw the second team standing by the door. Revi waved as she looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This place looks a lot better than it used to. I always thought the old place looked a bit run down. Hi, Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Solstice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous' eyes twinkled. Halrac nodded to Erin, cool as could be. He was not prepared for the [Innkeeper] to charge him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halrac! How've you been?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin tackle-hugged the [Scout]. He growled, embarrassed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get off. Erin. It's good to see—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A flying Gnoll, Mrsha, in this case, leapt off the table and shot towards him. Halrac caught her rather than let her drop and she hugged him gleefully. Revi and Typhenous started guffawing at the look on Halrac's face as Mrsha tried to nuzzle his face and Erin laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone else slapped her thighs and nearly doubled over. Erin turned as Briganda, eyes streaming, pointed at Halrac as he tried to get Mrsha to let go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halrac the Grim! &lt;/em&gt;More like 'Halrac the Softie'! &lt;em&gt;Hah!&lt;/em&gt; Wait till I tell Elm and Cassielle about &lt;em&gt;this!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin saw Briganda stride over. The [Shield Maiden] grabbed Erin in a one-arm and wrapped an arm around Halrac and Mrsha. She gave them all a bear hug. Erin squeaked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let. Go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac growled. He retreated, letting Mrsha drop to the floor. She and Erin turned to the woman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin's first impression of Briganda was a smiling face. She was probably ten years older than Erin—still young, but she seemed more motherly. That wasn't just a lucky guess either; she had that sense of looking out for children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello! Who are you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The name's Briganda. I'm a member of Griffon Hunt. One of the old crew. I just rejoined. And are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; Erin Solstice? I've heard so much about you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? I mean, hi! Any teammate of Griffon Hunt's is welcome. I'm Erin—this is Mrsha—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know! Hello, little one! Is she yours? Halrac didn't say. And he didn't say she was so adventurous! She'd be a regular [Swashbuckler]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda knelt down. Mrsha blinked up at her, but then boldly rose onto two legs and stuck out a paw. Briganda clasped it and shook vigorously. And Mrsha was quite pleased by the [Shield Maiden]'s bold smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mine…? No, Mrsha's, uh—I mean, I raise her, but she's not mine. She's—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mine. Hello. Halrac, Revi, Typhenous! And did I hear Briganda? I'm Lyonette, the manager of the inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] came over. Briganda turned and her eyebrows shot up. She looked at Lyonette, who was eighteen or closer to nineteen these days, up and down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well! You started early, but she's a darling child! And who's the man, I mean, Gnoll?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac slapped his face. Revi choked and Typhenous starting chuckling into his beard again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Briganda—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. &lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt; Dead gods, tell me these things, Halrac!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda grew flustered as she saw Halrac's face. She turned to Lyonette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Males,&lt;/em&gt; am I right? Up and leaving you? Sorry about that. I'd like to say mine ran off, but I never knew who it was! I have a kid myself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled as Lyonette's face contorted, trying to sort out what part of the misunderstanding to address first. Erin started laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's so good to see you all! Give me a hug, Typh! You too, Revi!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old man was only too glad to, and Mrsha raised her arms so she could be picked up and hugged. Revi embraced Erin lightly, laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It feels like ages since we saw you! Erin! How did you manage to get Pallass attacked by &lt;em&gt;Wyverns?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin colored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I didn't—that was just a coincidence! I think! You're looking good! New stitches?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You &lt;em&gt;noticed?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was a guess, but Revi was beyond pleased. She scooped Mrsha up and the Gnoll promptly licked her cheek. Mrsha liked Revi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come in, sit, sit! Did you get to Invrisil at the same time as the Horns? What's happened?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aside from travelling and Halrac punching our old teammate? Nothing much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whaaaaaat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why don't we &lt;em&gt;sit?&lt;/em&gt; Erin—any chance of a drink and some food?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac cleared his throat, avoiding Erin's gaze. The young woman brightened up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh my gosh! You have to try the Minotaur's Punch, Halrac! I mean, the flaming glory drink! I mean—I can make fire!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gold-rank adventurers knew she meant something else, but Revi had to take her shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Congratulations. So can anyone with a flint and tinder. Sure, set us up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Over here!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin led them to a table and was seating them, chattering and trying to explain the memory flames Skill she had—not to mention the &lt;em&gt;Garden&lt;/em&gt;—when Briganda exclaimed and stormed over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halrac, you pissant!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She kicked at him. The [Scout] growled as he had to half-leap out of his chair. Briganda's face was red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why didn't you tell me about Mrsha before I made an idiot of myself?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed at Lyonette, who had cleared things up and was investigating the door. Revi chortled but stopped as Briganda raised a fist. Halrac folded his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you'd listen before you spoke, Briganda—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Argh! I did! Dead gods. And we're in Liscor? Can we get back? I left Cade in the inn. He's fine I'm sure, but…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda glanced anxiously back at the door. Erin hurried to reassure her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The door'll be recharged soon! It just ran out because we had…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She counted. Nearly &lt;em&gt;twenty&lt;/em&gt; people had come through before it had failed. That was a lot better! Like Wailant had claimed, the ambient mana gave the door more teleportations and it would hopefully power back on soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank goodness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda sighed. And then Erin heard a shout from the side. She turned in time to see Temile charging the other Players of Celum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wesle! Jasi!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Producer] threw his arms around his friends. Wesle was laughing as he pounded Temile on the back and Jasi gave him a hug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Temile! &lt;/em&gt;We missed you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Liar! Did you even remember me? Wesle—dead gods, are you taller? Kilkran too!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Blacksmith] turned [Actor] with the voice like deep honey was beaming. The other Players crowded around Temile, whom they'd left behind in Celum, laughing and trying to talk at once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yimur and Pralcem too! And where's that damned [Writer], Andel? His first good play and he writes it only after you get to Invrisil? What have we been paying him for?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Temile shouted, looking around. A short part-Dwarf woman pushed her way through the others, literally lifting Andel out of the way. She raised a fist and shouted up at Temile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And me too! Where's my [Actors], Temile? You promised me—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And there they were. The original cast of the Players of Celum turned and saw over two dozen Gnolls, Drakes—even a Garuda staring at them. And they were just the [Actors]!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wesle breathed. Jasi's eyes went round at the sight of so many Drakes—an oddity to a Drake girl raised in Celum. Temile beamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"May I present to the Players of Celum—the Players of Liscor! That's what we've decided to go as, to avoid confusion. But our [Lead Actors] are over Level 15 already and everyone else is leveling fast! And behind you—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The stage. Oh, the &lt;em&gt;stage!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jasi sighed. It wasn't the very &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; stage she and Wesle had performed in—that had been in The Frenzied Hare, back in Celum. But this one was iconic. And the other, newer [Actors] were staring at the originals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Perhaps they could even feel the disparity in levels. Because Wesle and Jasi and Kilkran, Yimur, and Pralcem and some of the others shone. But Wesle and Jasi most of all. And—in the silence, Wesle swept a bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His voice took on that echoing quality, even though he was speaking normally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a pleasure indeed to meet the Players of Liscor! We salute you, fellow [Actors]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yimur and Pralcem, the Gnoll and Human, instantly stood to attention like [Guardsmen], giving such serious salutes that it was comical. Kilkran just drew himself back like the haughty [King] he loved to play and looked down his nose. But it was Jasi who had the best impression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Actors]? &lt;/em&gt;Why, my good Wesle, we shouldn't allow such &lt;em&gt;rabble&lt;/em&gt; in an establishment such as this. Send them away at once!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned, with such immediate and haughty distress that one of the Gnolls began to laugh. And then the Players of Celum flooded forwards to meet their counterparts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods! You told me you'd been putting the gold to good use but—dead gods!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emme was exclaiming. Temile was grinning at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You think you can use them, then?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt;! We've been having Yimur playing every Gnoll character running. And Eltistiman's been doing illusions along with makeup but it's not the same! We might have to train them up, but there's room on even our first lineup for them! You need to give me a list of their Skills—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Done. And you have an actual [Illusionist]? We have this Centaur, Palt, helping us, but you have one on the team?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emme gave him a sly smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And more gold than you can count! We have our own &lt;em&gt;theatre!&lt;/em&gt; Not that The Wandering Inn was bad, but we have security—&lt;em&gt;beard maggots!&lt;/em&gt; Have you not heard about the autographs?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The—you're still doing them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes! We have to catch up! No—we need to cast you in tonight's play! Emme! Temile would be the perfect replacement for one of our parts! And Temile—&lt;em&gt;what happened to your thumb?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jasi exclaimed. Temile looked down at the missing thumb on one hand and chuckled ruefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm afraid I'm ruined for swordplay. But I gave it for a good cause—the Creler attack, I told you, remember? Andel needs to put &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to a script."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others sobered for a second. Then Emme slapped Temile on the back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course! Of &lt;em&gt;course! &lt;/em&gt;There's so much we need to do! And we have seats for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; at the Season's Theatre—tonight! Everyone! Stop hugging each other! Remember, we have an hour to get on stage! We need to &lt;em&gt;prepare!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She roared and the Players of Celum stopped talking. Instantly, Wesle turned serious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I forgot! But Lady Reinhart and a number of nobles will be in attendance!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dead gods!&lt;/em&gt; We need to get into makeup!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kilkran tuned pale. The [Actors] rushed towards the door, but it was only just coming back to life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stand back! We're recharging it. Ceria, Pisces—Revi, Typhenous—can you add your mana to the door? It can probably stand a few trips, but &lt;em&gt;no one goes through! Got it?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette shook her fist at the people on the other side and a young woman with black and orange hair backed up. The Players were crowding around the door. Emme, worried, stumped over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can we put the Players back through, Miss Lyonette? We have to &lt;em&gt;perform?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—damn! If the [Mages] cooperate, yes! and the Sage's Grass will do its work, but I need to check on Liscor and—yes, yes! But only a few through at a time! Give the grass time to recharge!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wesle and Jasi first, then. And Kilkran and Yimur."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emme immediately ordered the others. The four stormed through and the door went dead again. Lyonette threw up her hands, but it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a faster recharge time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They'll have Eltistiman recharge the door on his end. Dead gods, I'll &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; for [Mages] to recharge the door if I have to! We can't have our best [Actors] over here! Send a [Message]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emme was pulling at her hair as she shouted. Lyonette was trying to calm Emme.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry! Don't worry! The door will put all your [Actors] through within an hour, Emme! Definitely! Even without anyone helping!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But they need to get prepared &lt;em&gt;now! &lt;/em&gt;They need makeup and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why not use ours?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Temile interrupted. Emme looked at him. The [Producer] turned and pointed. The Players of Liscor were already ransacking their makeup and props.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It might not be what you use in Invrisil, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Temile! My lovely Human!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emme dragged him down and planted a kiss on his forehead. Then she pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To makeup, everyone! And the rest of you—you'll all be guests of the theatre! In the Solstice booth! Wait—will we have Erin herself? Because we might not have enough room!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette and Temile stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Solstice…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then they looked at Erin. She was high-fiving Briganda and laughing in delight as Ceria and the Horns of Hammerad shouted their own stories. Lyonette shook her head after a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think Erin will be here, Emme."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just as well. She's a guest of honor and she deserves it when we have a moment ready for her. But the rest of you—let's get this done! The show must go on!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The part-Dwarf woman and Temile began giving orders as the [Actors] occupied the back of the [Grand Theatre] and began hurrying through the doorway. But they were only a part of the moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Eggs?&lt;/em&gt; You got sick eating eggs and that was why you were late?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin stared at Yvlon. The [Armsmistress] rolled her eyes as the rest of her team objected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; eggs. We beat Golems—Ksmvr got run out of town—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Twice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The eggs were just the latest thing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon assured Erin with a long-suffering sigh. Erin grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have to tell me &lt;em&gt;everything.&lt;/em&gt; But—there's going to be a lot of people coming in. Chaos. I'll get you your food, though!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"When is it not chaos here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria wondered aloud, with a laugh. Pisces sniffed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You would be surprised how quiet it was before. This is marginally more pleasant. At least now there's help. Ah, thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi had brought over a steak. Pisces and Ceria licked their lips and then stared at each other. Ceria whipped out her wand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Play you for it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both glanced at each other. Magical symbols began to flash in the air and then both conjured one. Erin saw a floating droplet of water, and a flying raven. Ceria groaned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She let Pisces take the steak-dish. The [Necromancer] smirked; it was magical rock-paper-scissors with far more combinations. He began slicing his steak into bite-sized pieces as Ksmvr raised one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"May I have some of the pizza, Miss Erin? Extra crusty?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one had ever demanded that, but Erin assured Ksmvr she'd do her best. As she went into the kitchen, a white Gnoll raced up excitedly. Mrsha had hugged Griffon Hunt and now it was their turn!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon bent. Mrsha sniffed at her arms and hugged her as the [Armsmistress] with excruciating care, gently squeezed Mrsha with a feather's amount of pressure. The Gnoll wiggled, was put down on the table, and got a hug from Ceria as the half-Elf laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're getting &lt;em&gt;bigger!&lt;/em&gt; And heavier!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha turned expectantly to Pisces. She spread her arms out mock-reluctantly, pretending to glare. And the [Necromancer] glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's you! Um…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He snapped his fingers a few times. Mrsha gave Pisces a &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; and folded her arms. The [Necromancer]'s face was perfectly blank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr, help me out here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium looked from Pisces to Mrsha and then his mandibles opened in comprehension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have no idea who this strange Gnoll is, Comrade Pisces. In fact, we should eject her for this rude interruption to our meal—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha scowled and leapt off the table. She punched Pisces in the leg. He smiled and flicked his fingers. A cube of cut steak floated off his plate. Mrsha jumped with her mouth open and it swerved out of the way. She glowered at Pisces, and then gave him a grudging thumbs-up with one paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was good to have him back. No one else in the inn dared stand up to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin giggled as she came back and saw Mrsha leaping about, trying to grab the bit of meat. Pisces was smiling and Ksmvr's mandibles opened wide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dis? Dis is a calzone. You want?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin proudly pointed at the abomination that was pizza folded over to create a pocket stuffed with goodies. Ksmvr nodded rapidly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is very good-looking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll have one too, Erin. Not to share."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf waved a hand eagerly. Yvlon looked disgusted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can I get a salad? And something—else?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure! We have a &lt;em&gt;menu.&lt;/em&gt; Wait, I probably should have brought that, shouldn't I? Here, Ksmvr…I'll be back!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin hurried into the kitchen as Mrsha poked her head over the table and stared at Ksmvr's calzone. He put one hand over it, protectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I do not know you, stranger. Begone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As Erin walked through her inn, she stopped for a second. She felt incredibly, almost deliriously happy to see her friends—and it hadn't been that long ago! But—then Erin froze and her brow darkened. Her mind connected something Magnolia had said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. &lt;em&gt;Those &lt;/em&gt;eggs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked back at the Horns of Hammerad. And felt something dark in her chest. Magnolia Reinhart. She'd…beaten Erin. At her own game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd been prepared. And Erin had not. She'd thought the Garden could save her friends. But the [Druid] had entered it—and Magnolia?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin had meant every word. &lt;em&gt;'I hate you.' &lt;/em&gt;Had she ever said that to someone else and meant it? Something black was in Erin's chest, burning there like a memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hatred&lt;/em&gt;. Helpless injustice, rage—oh yes, Erin could remember that. And it was rising in her, like some creeping dark force. Pure, unforgiving &lt;em&gt;loathing—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin blinked at her hands. She expected to see black fire, but…there was no flame. Erin sighed, but was almost relieved. She rubbed her hands on her jeans; they were all sweaty. Some fire she didn't need to see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And as she passed by them, a group of young people stared at Erin's back. Kevin whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That was a &lt;em&gt;calzone.&lt;/em&gt; I know it is! And that's Erin. I think. I don't remember her, do you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just wait and see, Kevin. Don't be an idiot. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it's her, but…this is her inn. Let's just listen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose whispered back. Joseph was half-rising. He glared at Rose. Why wait? But then—a Gnoll hurried over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, everyone. My name is Ishkr. I will be serving you all for tonight. Do you have your menus? I will take your orders now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Earthers stared up at the tall Gnoll. Then they looked at their menus. And they were &lt;em&gt;hungry&lt;/em&gt;. Imani looked at the list of foods and her stomach rumbled from meals missed or cut in half due to their dwindling budget. Joseph felt at his side. He had the coin from selling his sword, after all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—sure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"C-can we get a pizza? No—three?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin almost begged the Gnoll. Ishkr nodded and wrote down their order. Rose was looking at the menu and salivating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh my g—is that a &lt;em&gt;milkshake? &lt;/em&gt;I'll have one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;And me!&lt;/em&gt; And some french fries! &lt;em&gt;French fries, guys—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Earthers began ordering feverishly. Ishkr sighed as he wrote down the orders. And they actually cheered when the first pizza came towards them, already hot. It was only after they'd fought over the slices that Joseph raised his head and remembered something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. Where did that Maviola person get to?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Actors] had all left for Invrisil as [Mages] on both sides of the magical door charged it up. However, they were hardly the only people wanting to visit the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Word was spreading. As it did. And Maviola was suddenly among a press of people trying to get into the Player's inn, let alone The Wandering Inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fortunately, the bouncer, Redit, recognized Maviola and let her in while blocking the mundane patrons. But the [Innkeeper] in Invrisil wasn't about to let this many paying clients wait. He waved at Erin through the doorway as she passed by.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss! Miss! Can I have a word?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh! Hey! Are you the [Innkeeper] of this inn? I'm Erin, hi! Sorry about the confusion!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man was slightly portly, but jovial and a manager rather than hands-on—almost a stereotype of an [Innkeeper] as Erin imagined them. Sort of like the Drake, Peslas, from Liscor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But not as mean. He beamed at Erin, peering into the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, this is the inn that serves the Players of Celum! We're renaming ourselves to &lt;em&gt;The Player's Retreat&lt;/em&gt;, actually. My name's Veeid; I'm the [Innkeeper]. Level 36. This is one of the best inns in Invrisil; we can hold over a hundred regular guests easily. Which we'll need to do if the Players keep growing! And you must be Erin Solstice!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman blinked at the man's obvious admiration for the Players.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's me. Wow, a hundred guests?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course! That's most of our profits. We have a stables—very fine [Hostlers] who put any animal that comes in right to rest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] looked shocked. Erin blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stables. Wow, other inns actually have them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man looked askance, and then laughed heartily. Erin smiled too. He seemed decent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—there's a bit of a crowd around my front door this moment. My [Bouncers] can keep most of 'em out, but they're begging just to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what's in your door. Mind if I let them in? The Players are out and we'll cordon them from the regular sitting area…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Flustered, Erin hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're going to switch this door to Pallass and Liscor and other places—but yeah, I can keep it here. There won't be much to see, but maybe they can chat with other people? If they want to come through…well, the door runs out of mana, but we can work something out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Veeid was nodding. He hesitated, looking towards the shouting coming from his front door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I'd be rather pleased if you kept your door here, Miss Solstice. The traffic might bother the Players, but for tonight? Its profits to be made. I'd give you ten percent of what I earn, even if it's just letting the people in?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ten percent? Nah, I don't need—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Erin!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette rushed over and knocked Erin aside. She smiled at Veeid's shocked expression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, Erin's too nice for her own good. Let's do ten percent. And we can sell through to your inn, Mister Veeid? We have &lt;em&gt;ice cream.&lt;/em&gt; Gelato, I think it's called."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have—well, the Players said you did but I didn't believe 'em! More fool me! Absolutely, Miss! Sell into my inn and I'll have my staff take it. Ten percent?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. We can just do a headcount if you want to make it simple."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette hesitated, but took the man's hand. He smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll do an accounting; don't you worry, Miss…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lyon, sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Veeid nodded, waving at his [Head Waiter].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't you worry. I've heard all about them bad eggs in Celum. Mister Wesle and Miss Jasi had some tales. I'm a fair fighter when it comes to adding and subtracting—I know exactly how much I make in a day, down to a half-copper or pennies! Not that anyone pays with those in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; inn!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He laughed. Lyonette smiled in relief. Veeid glanced at the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Redit! Let 'em in! I'll tell you when to stop! Just keep out the riffraff!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bouncer] stepped back. A flood rushed into the inn, staring at the doors. Veeid looked at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can put up a little barrier, keep 'em out of your inn, Miss Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? You don't need to do that. It's free. We just need to move people back and forth."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper]'s brows shot up. Maviola, looking around and feeling around for a spare coin, sighed in relief. She began to shove into line as the patrons heard and clustered up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Free? &lt;/em&gt;You'll get everyone in Invrisil wanting to duck in and out, Miss Solstice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ooh. Yeah. Then—&lt;em&gt;hey! We'll let people in, but later! We'll do random selections! Don't make a line! Just give us—half an hour!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin waved her hands at the people. They blinked and shouted back, but Erin shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No line! Go eat food! We'll get you menus! Who wants &lt;em&gt;ice cream? Gelato!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crowd murmured. They returned to their seats, demanding to see as Lyonette hurried back with menus. Veeid's eyebrows were almost engulfing his scalp. He stared as Erin nodded at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm gonna let Lyonette handle the door. Nice to meet you, Mister Veeid! I think Zevara's coming and she is &lt;em&gt;angry!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hurried off. Veeid glanced at Lyon…or Lyonette. The [Princess] grimaced, but the [Innkeeper] hadn't caught Erin's slip. He stared after Erin's back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who is &lt;em&gt;that,&lt;/em&gt; Miss Lyon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette didn't know what he meant at first. But the male [Innkeeper] was staring at Erin's back in awe. He looked at his orderly guests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She just ordered them about like &lt;em&gt;that.&lt;/em&gt; I couldn't manage it with Redit behind me on a crowded day. She has to be—and that level at her age?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's…fairly high-level."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] murmured. Veeid gave her a knowing look and shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There are less than twenty [Innkeepers] in all of Izril higher level than her, I'd wager. Dead gods. And I thought the Players of Celum made it up. Let me know if you have anything and I'll be right over, Miss. It's a…pleasure to have The Wandering Inn connected to mine for the night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] blinked as he gave her a little nod. She smiled back. And then Veeid turned back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. One important thing, Miss Lyon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He'd intercepted a menu. The [Innkeeper] dug out some coins and handed them to Lyon. Exact change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One 'ice cream' for me, please."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Watch Captain Zevara stormed into Erin's inn. She looked around, and asked if Magnolia or the other [Ladies] were present. When Erin assured her they were not, the Watch Captain grunted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd come here on foot, but more and more people wanted into the inn &lt;em&gt;now. &lt;/em&gt;And they were coming via the regular door or the magic one as Lyonette turned the dial frantically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If they're not here…I'll take some of your portable foods, Miss Solstice. Those ham…ham…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hamburgers?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Make it four. No, five. And some drinks. Alcoholic. I'm not facing this sober. And the door to Pallass—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned as the door opened. Magus Grimalkin strode in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Watch Captain. There you are. Pallass' High Command wants you on a group communication chat. I'll provide the spell."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I was just getting hamburgers. Does four for you work?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Do they have ham? I was under the impression they were beef."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both Drakes looked at Erin. She blinked at them. At Grimalkin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're…beef. With lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and stuff."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No onion on mine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara informed Drassi, who'd hurried over with a bag of fries. Grimalkin saw the sealed mug of whiskey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drinks, Watch Captain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll have it after I hear that number Magnolia Reinhart promised me, Sinew Magus. And you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He thought about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Maybe an ale. Miss Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned to her. And then the two looked at each other slowly. Erin gazed up at Grimalkin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you happy about what Magnolia did, Grimalkin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her face fell as the [Magus] avoided looking directly at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I would have preferred not to be caught off-guard, but on the whole, it was beneficial to Izril, Miss Solstice. Liscor as well. That number…you understand Magnolia Reinhart analyzed the entire Hive? It is substantially higher than it should be, under any implementation of the Antinium's treaty. This is information all the cities need to know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara's shoulders hunched. She looked at Drassi, hurrying over with the burgers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Double my drink order."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bartender] threw up her claws and raced off. More people were coming in. No Antinium, save for the ones present. Erin looked at Grimalkin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I guess Magnolia's on your side, then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sinew Magus] refused to answer that. Erin felt something dark creeping up on her. But she forced it away. She shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine. Go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"More people from Pallass are waiting to come through! I have two [Tacticians], Watch Captain Venim, Major—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sergeant Kel was arguing with Lyonette as she tried to protest that the door would run out of power again. Erin walked up to the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's this? The door doesn't have enough power. Get a [Mage]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We would like to enter the inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A haughty Drake informed Erin. She looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, really? But are you on Kel's list?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake hesitated. Sergeant Kel bit his lip. And Erin shut the door and turned the dial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette stared at Erin. The [Innkeeper] looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Change it back once we get more people through from Liscor and elsewhere."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] did, biting back a comment about how unusually aggressive Erin had been.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do we do about people in Invrisil, Erin? They want to come through and we can't handle the numbers, even with the Sage's Grass…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin watched a small flood of Gnolls and Drakes, arguing about what they'd seen, come through. She caught a few hints of conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—came to our aid the first time during the First Antinium Wars. She may be a Human, but she's the best of them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's one of the &lt;em&gt;Five Families.&lt;/em&gt; As trustworthy as a snake in your pants!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What kind of snake?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She just kneecapped the Antinium with that move. If they have kneecaps. I don't know. But she's on &lt;em&gt;our side.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah? And I think the Antinium are fine. Who saved us in the Second Antinium Wars?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are they called the &lt;em&gt;Antinium Wars,&lt;/em&gt; scales-for-brains?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] shook her head. She felt—lousy. Despite her friends coming to visit. And the lousiness was getting worse by the second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll let some of them through, Lyonette. That's all from Liscor? Check every five minutes. Now—Esthelm—Wailant's farm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dead gods! I just saw everything on the scrying orb! Is that [Lady] still here?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wailant stormed into the inn, Viceria on his heels. Erin recoiled as the [Farmer] looked around. He shook Erin's hand, laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rhir's hell! What a thing to see! No Reinhart, huh? Damn, but I'm in such a good mood! We'll visit the inn if that's alright, Miss Erin? And the door's open to Invrisil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, Wailant. Sure. I mean—yeah!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Invrisil. What a miraculous thing. We might have to prevail on you to visit, Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Viceria's eyes were shining. Wailant laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just drinks for tonight. Dead gods, what a sight! Hey, is that Seborn bastard here? I want to jaw with him about what he said about [Storm Sailors] on that damned scrying orb! As in, &lt;em&gt;punch him in the jaw…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He walked past Erin. The [Innkeeper] saw Viceria give her an apologetic smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, Wailant's very passionate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, no—I'm glad someone is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two entered the inn. And then Lyonette changed the door to Invrisil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay, so what are we going to do about the visitors, Erin—?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he was standing in the doorway. Erin and Lyonette recoiled, but it was too late. He stepped into the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Reynold the [Butler] bowed smartly to both Erin and Lyonette. He had a letter and scroll in his hands. Erin backed up and looked for Magnolia. But she was not there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reynold? What are you…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good evening, Miss Solstice. I apologize for the disturbance, but Lady Reinhart has ordered me to deliver both a piece of correspondence for Miss Byres and a proclamation regarding the use of your door. I regret the disturbance, and, indeed, the last incident as does her ladyship."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Reynold spoke crisply, but Erin's face was frozen. She had liked Reynold. But that had been on their short ride. And he no longer called her by her first name—perhaps sensing that the trust had been broken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What does Lady Reinhart want?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette was cautious. Reynold unfurled the scroll. He read out loud and to everyone in earshot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In light of the marvelous door connecting Invrisil to Liscor, Lady Magnolia Reinhart, as [Lady] of Invrisil, has decreed that the usage of the door is to be taxed per visitor for any usage with exception only in the case of Miss Erin Solstice and the employees of her inn. The price per visitor shall be six silver coins, two of which will be given to Invrisil, two to Liscor, and two to The Wandering Inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin blinked in surprise and then outrage. She opened her mouth, but Reynold went on. And there was a—significance to his words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Reinhart also decrees that this door shall not be used to transmit correspondence, merchandise, or any other goods or valuables that would interfere with the natural order of trade &lt;em&gt;without signatory agreement between Invrisil and the concerned parties. &lt;/em&gt;This order is enforced by Lady Magnolia's Skill, [Written Decree] and shall take effect this very moment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He rolled up the scroll. And Erin felt the Skill take hold in a moment. There was no flash of light. No other effect. She just knew and was bound by it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And her mood turned blacker still. Reynold bowed slightly to Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am sorry, Miss Solstice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. There goes easy selling the Sage's Grass. That Reinhart is a clever bitch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wailant cursed at his table. Erin looked through the door. Lyonette herself was…impressed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Six silver? That wasn't exorbitant, but you had to pay it twice to get &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt;. And it would prohibit most casual people from entering while at the same time promoting healthy visitation. And it would make the inn, Liscor, and Invrisil a tidy profit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;However, Erin was clearly not in the mood to think of that. She glared at Reynold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I guess that's another thing I don't have a say in, huh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am deeply sorry for the inconvenience, Miss Erin. But Invrisil &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the domain of Lady Reinhart. She has a vested interest in not destabilizing the Runner's Guild or Merchant's Guild."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Butler] bowed again. Erin shook her head. She was angry. Hateful. And trying not to throw it onto him. But she couldn't help herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reynold. How can &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;be part of that? That—you're not a bad guy. But that was wrong. Magnolia could have talked to me! She could have done anything else! But she didn't. She did the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; thing. She's—an idiotic—that stupid—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin literally didn't have enough bad words or practice using them. She was so angry at Magnolia. But—to her surprise, Reynold looked up and shook his head at her words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had been shamefaced, refusing to meet her eyes. But now the [Butler] stiffened. He nodded to Erin, politely, but his voice was firm in disagreement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Erin. I do regret the way the incident occurred. And Lady Reinhart is less than…polite in her way. She has used your inn to her advantage. However, I would ask that you refrain from insulting her in my presence."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin looked at Reynold incredulously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't you know what she &lt;em&gt;did?&lt;/em&gt; She wrecked the chances of helping the Antinium! She just made war more likely and for what? To get in with the Walled Cities? She could have done something better. &lt;em&gt;Nicer.&lt;/em&gt; She could have—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Butler] met her eyes calmly as he shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Solst—Erin. I hope you will never have to defend all of Invrisil. Let alone Lady Reinhart's estates, which contains more land and people than many [Kings] or [Queens] will ever rule. It is true she can be cruel. It is true that for her justice or safety, she runs roughshod over the rights of a few for the many."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She is cruel. But have you never hurt someone to help them? I set bones in battle. And men screamed and cursed my name at the time. But they thanked me later. Perhaps Lady Reinhart could be kinder. But was she wrong? Erin Solstice, you have never seen The Black Tide march. Perhaps you would change your opinions then. But I hope never to see such a sight again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman didn't know what to say to the polite [Butler]. But the [Princess]? Lyonette du Marquin looked at Reynold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well said, Mister Reynold, was it? I'd expect nothing less from one of Magnolia Reinhart's servants. She does garner loyalty from her people."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She paused as Reynold and Erin looked at her. Lyonette went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She has earned your loyalty, sir. But I fear Lady Reinhart treats others like disposable objects to be used against their will. I hope &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; never find yourself a piece in one of her games."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Butler]'s eyes flickered as Erin looked gratefully at Lyonette. He hesitated, and then Reynold bowed again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Begging your deepest pardons for my incivility, Miss Solstice, Miss Lyon. I will not trouble you further."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned and marched over to Yvlon. The [Butler] bowed, handed Yvlon a letter. Then, he returned to Lyonette, handed her six silver coins, and walked out the door and back through to Invrisil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Erin could come up with after that. Another slap in the face. And worst—she couldn't even undo the slap. She tried—she could go through, but when she asked Ceria to flout Magnolia's rules, the half-Elf found she couldn't leave without handing Erin six silver coins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Now that's enforcement of a rule. A Skill for a [Lady]. Yvlon, what was that missive?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces observed. Yvlon stared up at him from her letter. The woman's face was pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She &lt;em&gt;knew.&lt;/em&gt; Take a look at this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She showed her team the letter. It was a short message from Magnolia Reinhart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Yvlon,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I consider the presence of your little friend, Ksmvr, an acceptable one in Invrisil, and I have spoken with the Watch Commander regarding it. Please do refrain from using your rank too much in Invrisil, although I quite understand this occasion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On another note, do send me more of your little letters if you ever have the time! I did regret it when they stopped, but I suppose you grew older. You must call upon me on my estates sometime. Oh—and your Gold-rank is exceptionally well-deserved. Do introduce me to your team when you get the chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;–Magnolia Reinhart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. How did she &lt;em&gt;know?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria stared at Yvlon. The young woman was blinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I'd almost forgotten I used to send her letters every week. I stopped when my brother and father told me it wasn't good etiquette. She missed them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another moment of awe, superstition around Lady Magnolia Reinhart's reputation. Erin had had enough of her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going to go upstairs and play chess. &lt;em&gt;No one had better bother me!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She growled and stomped off. Her mood was darker still and she couldn't shake it off. Damn Magnolia Reinhart and her stupid laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On Invrisil's side, Veeid was relieved about the rule. He waved at Lyonette as he spooned ice cream out of the bowl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Reinhart has it, Miss Lyon. We'll also be safe of people sneaking through—unless they've the Skills or level to defeat Lady Reinhart's Skill! Hm, shall I let people come through now? And may I purchase this delightful ice cream?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Certainly. We'll talk pricing later. But The Wandering Inn is open for anyone who'd like to come through—or visit Liscor! Line up and once Master Veeid accepts your coin, we'll send you through. One moment!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She closed the door and began to announce to Pallass the new fee—not that Magnolia's Skill worked on Pallass' side. Lyonette just thought it was a good idea to establish standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that was that. A few patrons promptly went to Veeid, but most were content on this side—for the time being. After all, the Players had left so Erin's inn really only had the food going for it, and that was flowing through the door. The new travel-fee was sensible, mildly obtrusive, didn't gate the door's usage too much…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—But really put a sour note in Maviola's mouth. She felt at her belt pouch. And then she began to curse Lady Bethal and her charming husband with every word she knew. And unlike Erin—she knew a lot of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wandering Inn was beginning to gather a crowd. It hadn't been much more than early evening when Magnolia had launched her sneak attack, so now the dinner crowd and people wanting to be in the inn where the drama had happened were flooding in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha was over the moon. She was leaping from Griffon Hunt's table to the Horn's, playing with her old friends! And here came the Halfseekers, who hadn't had to pay any silver!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halrac! We got to Invrisil at last! Come here you idiots!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jelaqua charged the table and Halrac kicked her away. He'd had enough of hugging. But then Moore and Seborn and that new Ulinde were coming through! Mrsha beamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they were so busy talking they had no time for &lt;em&gt;her!&lt;/em&gt; Moore patted her head a few times, but everyone was caught up &lt;em&gt;reminiscing&lt;/em&gt;. And Mrsha was bored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So she took to the street, which was actually the inn's floor. And went hunting, or rather, begging for scraps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw, what a &lt;em&gt;cute Gnoll!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Human exclaimed. Rose offered Mrsha some fries. Mrsha stole the plate. She ran away as the Earthers laughed and just ordered another. Mrsha wasn't really that hungry, but the victory of snatching food was the rush she craved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was dashing towards the door to Invrisil, wondering if she could intercept some ice cream on the way out—although Ishkr was a tricky opponent, who'd promptly call Lyonette for any trouble—when a boy appeared in the crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was short—thirteen or so—but taller than Mrsha. Just by a bit if she stood up! And he looked tough, agile on his feet. He blinked as Mrsha appeared and she blinked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She…knew him. Grev? &lt;em&gt;Grev&lt;/em&gt;, yes! From the Players of Celum. Only, he hadn't gone with the [Actors] to the play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey! You're that Mrsha kid! Fancy that! We meet again!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev grinned at her. Mrsha didn't like the 'kid' bit. But she saw Grev tug and out of the crowd came a little, bawling…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Boy? Yes, a little boy! He was all snotty and crying. Grev showed him to Mrsha; the boy was very young.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This here's Cade. Mind helpin' me find Briganda? This is her boy and he's snottin' up something fierce wanting her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mom!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cade wailed. Mrsha realized Briganda must have forgotten about him in the heat of being caught up with all these new people. And Cade had wandered into The Wandering Inn through the door, rather than staying in Redit's care. A failure on multiple sides, although Briganda would probably kick Redit into the wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's around here somewhere. But all these adults are getting in the way!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev groused as the inn filled to maximum, despite the [Grand Theatre] Skill. Mrsha looked around. Even she couldn't see over the crowd, but she knew where the adventurers were…roughly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The problem was that Grev and Mrsha might have dodged the many legs, but Cade was slow and much less nimble. Mrsha regarded him. Then she tapped Grev on the shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? What? What's that paw-stuff? Oh, right. Can't speak, can you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha rolled her eyes as the [Street Urchin] squinted at her. She pointed at the nearest wall and Grev tugged Cade over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"C'mon, Cade. Your mom's not far. Stop crying, would you? I should've gone with Jasi and the lot, but I've seen all the plays dozens of times…here. Look, this' Mrsha. She'll help you find your mom, see?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cade stopped crying as Grev pointed at Mrsha. He was clutching his magical little box in his other hand, but he dropped it as he &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at the white Gnoll. His mouth dropped open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dog?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha shook her head. Then she jerked backwards; the little boy was trying to pet her head!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev sighed as he scooped up Cade's precious toy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not a dog, Cade. A &lt;em&gt;Gnoll.&lt;/em&gt; Don't pet her head! What's this, Mrsha? That's a wall. We going around the edge of the room? Might work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He critically eyed Mrsha. She shook her head and pointed. Grev was a kid of the street. But in his way he knew his world. He was asking her, a [Hunter] in her domain, where to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had &lt;em&gt;ways. &lt;/em&gt;Grev's eyes lit up as Mrsha walked towards a wall and motioned. He stared as the magical entrance appeared, showcasing a grassy hill, a jungle to the left. His jaw dropped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garden of Sanctuary. Cade stopped crying through his eyes and nose entirely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Blooming rat shit. That Miss Erin got even weirder than I remember. No one'll &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; believe this!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev strode up towards the door. Mrsha raced forwards as guests of the inn turned, and Grev, Cade, and a few Drakes and Gnolls tried to follow her. All ran &lt;em&gt;smack&lt;/em&gt; into the invisible barrier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cade began to cry again. Grev felt at the magical barrier, frowning, as some of the adults &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt;. But that [Druid]—Nathal-whatever—hadn't broken the entry mechanism. Mrsha frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Normally Erin had to let them in, but Mrsha had assumed Grev and Cade, as children, were &lt;em&gt;on her list.&lt;/em&gt; But apparently not. Still—Mrsha needed them to come through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So she tried it. She padded over and grabbed both's hands. Then Mrsha tried to &lt;em&gt;pull&lt;/em&gt; them into the garden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was resistance, but Mrsha felt both pulling forwards. Cade and Grev yelped, not exactly in pain, and Mrsha ­&lt;em&gt;heaved&lt;/em&gt;. There was a &lt;em&gt;pop&lt;/em&gt; and both tumbled forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Into the Garden of Sanctuary. Grev immediately got up and stared around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. It's grass and stuff! And it even smells nice!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's pretty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cade looked around, wide-eyed. Mrsha was smiling smugly. She gestured around and then made the door reappear by the adventurers. But Cade and Grev were awestruck. They stared around and Mrsha decided to give them the silver-coin tour. She raced forwards and they ran after her, excited as could be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As they ran, they didn't notice the figure sitting on the hilltop at first. But that was because he was green, and sitting still.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue chewed on some of Erin's new calzone and listened. He was separate from the main inn, having retreated here for some peace and quiet. Sit in the inn among all the other people and be bothered? No thank you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he was also in…a conference. A meeting of minds. Or souls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His other two guests weren't eating, but Pyrite had had a minute's worth of pizza—just a slice, you had to savor your food—and pronounce it good. And the other Goblin—well, he wasn't part of Numbtongue. Yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were speaking. Advising the [Bard]. Numbtongue didn't trust the Goblin Lord. He had killed Headscratcher, or Az'kerash had, through him. But he was listening. That was all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He'd been blindsided by the [Ladies]. Helpless as everyone else. He hadn't even &lt;em&gt;realized&lt;/em&gt; he'd done nothing until it was over. That was what terrified the [Bard]. But Pyrite and Reiss were more sanguine about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can't defeat high-levels. Plans. Three at once. Not good. [Ladies] hard to kill. Run away—throw an axe when not looking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pyrite opined. He was sitting at his ease, &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; a Sage's Grass plant. But his ghost was there. So was Reiss'. The Goblin Lord nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ladies can't hurt you directly. If they wanted to hurt you—you could fight back. They used the power of formality, which relies on doing no direct harm. All their power is like this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Reiss reached &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; Numbtongue. The living Hobgoblin recoiled, but Reiss' hand was just nothingness. The Goblin Lord nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The power of [Ladies] is strongest in their class. Alliances. Indirect power. They do nothing to your face, but they hit you a day, a week, a month later with a thousand spears. Words are their weapons. If I was joined with you—I could have resisted. But for one minute."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not bad thing happening to Antinium. Good to watch flanks. Antinium are dangerous. Good ones are good. But bad ones? Like Humans."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pyrite nodded as Numbtongue tore off some of the calzone and chewed. He felt better. Reiss nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Az'kerash is more dangerous. His minions are everywhere. I told you. Let me help. I can enchant basic objects. Use my strength."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not yet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue muttered. Not yet. He didn't want to have Reiss in him. It was more than just a grudge. Being Reiss meant living his perspective, knowing his memories. He would see Headscratcher die a second time. He also didn't want…to sympathize with his foe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Reiss sighed. He looked at Pyrite and the [Chieftain] tried to chew on some dirt. He was probably thinking of something that would convince Numbtongue when the Goblin heard a scream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"G-G—Goblin!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked down. Grev was standing there, with Mrsha. But the little boy who'd run up the hill, laughing too hard to notice him at first was unfamiliar. And Cade, for all his youth, was an adventurer's child. He took one look at Numbtongue and screamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Goblin!&lt;/em&gt; Mom! &lt;em&gt;Gooooblin!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue stared blankly at the child as the boy tumbled down the hill. Cade ran screaming as Numbtongue kept chewing on his food. Mrsha waved her paws, but she couldn't shout. And Grev wasn't helping. He laughed at Cade's panic as the boy fled—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Right until Cade ran into the jungle section. Into one of the burr-bushes Mrsha wanted uprooted and gone out of her garden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The burrs were big. Not the sharpest, but they hurt more than anything. Numbtongue &lt;em&gt;winced&lt;/em&gt; as Cade screamed and thrashed around in the bush. The Hobgoblin got up with a sigh and strode down the hill as Mrsha and Grev tried to help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Move."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin shooed the children out of the way. He picked Cade up and began to pull the burrs off him as the child screamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And only then did Numbtongue look up and realize that the door to Erin's inn was connected right to the adventurer's seats. And Briganda was on her feet, looking at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Cade!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The adventuress bellowed. The other adventurers had been laughing or seeing what was the matter. They didn't realize how alarmed Briganda, the only one of them not used to Numbtongue, was. She charged and they grabbed for her, shouting, too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stop, stop! He's not a monster! Well—he is, but he's a guest of Miss—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev shouted as he and Mrsha tried to bar the way. But Briganda had her axe and buckler out. She charged with a war cry as Numbtongue put Cade down. Tensely, he felt at his sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Looks strong. Pyrite?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He's used his Pyrite-minute already, but the Hob could give him tactical advice. Pyrite stumped over as Numbtongue's world slowed, and stared at Briganda, sizing her up. The [Chieftain] narrowed his eyes, nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Nope."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Magestone Chieftain] sat on the floor. Numbtongue stared at his friendly ghost. And then realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda charged at Numbtongue, who was standing in the garden with her son. She &lt;em&gt;smashed&lt;/em&gt; into the open doorway and the invisible barrier protecting the Garden of Sanctuary. Mrsha, Grev, Numbtongue all &lt;em&gt;winced&lt;/em&gt;. Cade looked up as his mother reeled backwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mom?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda hacked at the invisible door, but she only struck the wall with her enchanted axe. She left a few marks in it before the others pulled her off. And calmed her down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; you there's a friendly Goblin in the inn! You know the Halfseekers!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi shouted at Briganda, embarrassed, as Numbtongue ushered Cade through the door. The boy, no longer frightened, stared at the Hobgoblin. Briganda was bright red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I reacted, okay? I heard Cade screaming and—I'm sorry! I just didn't—I'm sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Apologize to him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac turned his head, gesturing at Numbtongue. Briganda stared at him and then called at Numbtongue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry—Hobgoblin fellow. Didn't mean it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue waved idly. He tossed Mrsha and Grev through the door. Then he calmly went back up to the hilltop. Reiss eyed the milkshake Numbtongue had taken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you sure you do not wish to mingle with them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. Too many people."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you will not accept my aid?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not today."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Goblin Lord sighed. He looked at Numbtongue's food. Pyrite smacked his lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Is that…&lt;em&gt;tasty?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bard] smirked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El stared through the open doorway. She cursed Lady Bethal. She cursed Magnolia Reinhart's door tax. It looked &lt;em&gt;really fun&lt;/em&gt; in there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. Could I just—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No fee, no entry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Redit folded his arms. He was managing the door. Maviola fumed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Couldn't I just walk over and…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; could have walked through that door, Magnolia's orders or not. But the young [Lady] was stuck. Fuming, she watched as, through the door, more people began entering the inn. They were paying, going through—and eating &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;! Her stomach was rumbling fiercely; she'd had breakfast with the Horns, half a sandwich, and nothing else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know the Horns of Hammerad. Let me at least talk to them. I told you, my money pouch was stolen!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola snapped at Redit. The [Bouncer] regarded her, and reluctantly, sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It'd get me in trouble with Master Veeid."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked pointedly at the [Innkeeper], who was among the people enjoying The Wandering Inn's food. Maviola's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Now, how would she do this as a young woman? Flirt with the big man, probably. That would do the trick. That was a young woman's trick and it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Maviola was old and young. And she had no time for insolent [Bouncers]. So, as the crowds cleared, she raised two hands to her mouth and shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ceria Springwalker!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her voice was &lt;em&gt;loud. &lt;/em&gt;Redit winced and began to push Maviola back, but the half-Elf had heard. She came to the door. Her eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Maviola? &lt;/em&gt;Oh, tree rot! I'm sorry, I totally forgot you were with us! Come on through! I have to introduce you to Erin! And I think your friends are somewhere around here…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola smiled in relief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Actually, I've been stuck here. Someone stole my money pouch! And my horse!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She neglected to mention who. Ceria's eyes went wide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? That's &lt;em&gt;terrible!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can you spot me six silver? I'll pay you back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can just give it to you—hey! Redit! Here's the money. Let her through already! And come on, we've got food!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria waved Maviola through. The young woman smiled triumphantly at Redit, who looked slightly abashed. But she was serene in victory. She only paused at the entrance of the door to give the [Bouncer] a damn good kick in the rear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who's this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other adventurers blinked at Maviola. Ceria explained about her situation, but the [Lady] was optimistic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll put in a request with the Watch. They'll get the gold back in a couple of days."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what Thomast had promised. Pisces looked dubious, as did Typhenous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Watch doesn't find most [Thieves]. We can surely feed you. And give you some coin—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll take the food. But I can manage with only a bit. Thank you. It was a stroke of luck meeting you all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola smiled. Yvlon murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Unless meeting us got you robbed. And here I thought Invrisil was &lt;em&gt;safe.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is unless you have money. The gangs aren't as strong elsewhere, but one must watch oneself. If Lady Maviola looked like a ripe mark—er, that is to say, an easy target, she'd have been sought out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous murmured. Pisces grimaced as he glanced sidelong at Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Her horse was quite splendid, what I saw of it. And a [Lady] would be…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others fell silent. Maviola grimaced, but only for a moment. And here they thought she was an air-headed [Lady]? Well enough. She sat at the table, and noticed Grev grabbing some pizza. She copied him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll sort it out. But tonight, if you'll tolerate my company—I'll toast the generosity of adventurers and friends on the road!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hear, hear! So long as you don't mind drinking with Selphids? And my…&lt;em&gt;partner&lt;/em&gt; is coming. Maughin. You have to meet him, Halrac!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jelaqua raised her mug, laughing. Maviola laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Selphid? I'll trade kisses for drinks with Antinium or Goblins!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw Yvlon blink. So did Ksmvr—well his antennae waved. The others laughed. But Maviola was partly serious. She wanted to know what these…unique Antinium were up to. Why a Hobgoblin with a guitar sat in an inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was a perfect last adventure. But for the moment Maviola bit into the pizza. And the novel experience made her laugh with delight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the inn, the party was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; getting started. Although…Erin was upstairs, playing moody games of chess and ignoring her partner, who was asking if 'anything had happened'. Did he know? Who was he?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The world was sucky. Erin Solstice sat, remembering Magnolia Reinhart &lt;em&gt;smiling&lt;/em&gt; as she hurt Erin's friends. She wouldn't forget this. She slammed a chess piece down, angry. Not even chess was calming her down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Below, in the inn, the real party had begun. Relc leapt into the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I'm here at last! &lt;/em&gt;Get me a pizza, a drink, and let's get this party st—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked around. No one was paying any attention. Relc's shoulder slumped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw. Where're my people? The Players of Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at the empty [Grand Theatre], forlorn, as Selys walked past him and towards the table. She was…apprehensive. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Selys?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces saw her first. He stood up. Selys waved a claw at him, smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two met as the others stood up, calling out greetings to Relc and Selys. The [Necromancer] blinked at Selys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I suppose we are meeting all the old friends. Hello."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He smiled. Selys did too, but with reservation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi. I didn't know when you would arrive at Invrisil. You kept us waiting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Necromancer] smiled ruefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Circumstances…arranged that. But we are back in Liscor, for a time. And, while our future is in the air, I was considering bringing up your—request to me with my team. Why don't you sit, and we can catch up? This amusing incident occurred with eggs, aside from Lady Magnolia's eventful arrival, of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Selys smiled. But she was looking about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd love to, Pisces. But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Selys! &lt;/em&gt;And all the adventurers!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk bounded through the crowd, beaming. He was back in Liscor already, having beaten even the door. And—he was dressed to impress. Pisces blinked as Hawk came over, in a suit contoured for his body. It wasn't really fitting with the inn—but the Rabbit Beastkin was smiling at Selys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Selys, I've gotten the private room. Unless you'd like to eat out here? Hi…Halrac, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gold-rank adventurers nodded to Hawk. But the Courier wasn't exactly a regular at the inn. Relc chortled as he edged over to the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mind if I sit? Hey, do I know you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. And I'd know you anywhere. Relc, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev eyed Relc. But that was background noise. Selys was looking at Pisces. He blinked a few times, and then, instantly, smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, you're engaged. Well then, I'll discuss the matter later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. Later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Selys smiled. The two of them nodded at each other, and Hawk escorted Selys away. Pisces sat back down, reached for a drink, and saw Ceria and Yvlon looking at him. Ceria looked oblivious, laughing at Relc as he blinked at Briganda, who was sizing him up. Yvlon…just tipped her cup up and gave Pisces a nod. He sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Do they have anything stronger in this inn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Strange meetings. The same question was being asked by Kevin, who had some of Joseph's sword-money coin and was inquiring about drinks at the bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So…what's a Drake do for fun, anyways?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi gave Kevin a blank look as she served drinks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The same thing Humans do, I suppose. Are you flirting? Because I'm on duty and I'm probably going to be too tired afterwards. Late night shift on nights like these."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Well—what've you got on tap? Strong stuff. Good money for the drink. I'm on a budget."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin slapped the coins down. Drassi looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm…Firebreath Whiskey is cheapest. Let me get you…a quarter of a bottle? How many shots?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Seven."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin sighed and leaned against the bar. Strike &lt;em&gt;out.&lt;/em&gt; And don't go back up to bat or you'll just look stupid. More so than already. The young man sighed, looked around the inn—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt; as he saw Bird at the bar. The Antinium was eating—Belgrade and Pawn were enjoying a meal with Lyonette in a private room during her break, but Bird, oblivious to everything, was eating a chicken wing at the bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was breaded. And the Antinium was sitting by himself as no one wanted to be near him; probably why Kevin had been able to order. He stared at Bird. Bird stared at his food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Hey. That's an Antinium. They're friendly. Not monsters, got it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi poked Kevin in the back. He jumped. She had the shots. He took them, carried them over to the table with his friends, and then came back. Bird was still eating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh—hey. Cheers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin spoke. Bird looked up and the young man took a sip of the powerful, painful, &lt;em&gt;spicy&lt;/em&gt; whiskey. It did a lot of good work for what you drank, he knew full well. Bird waved his antennae idly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What am I being cheerful about, please?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Stuff. Hey. My name's Kevin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Worker digested this, and then nodded. He began eating the bird bones as well as the meat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Bird."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Cool. So, what are you, like—an Ant-person? Nice to meet you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is correct."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—why's your name Bird?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium looked up again, as if surprised this conversation was still ongoing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I like birds."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin nodded agreeably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I like 'em too. You mean, like…chicken? Turkeys and stuff?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bird nodded, and then his mandibles drew together. He paused, and then edged over on his seat. He gave Kevin a long stare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…What is this 'turkey' you mention? And please explain other stuff, which may be birds."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Kevin made a friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They strolled in as gentle as you please. Coins to the doorman, a doff of the cap. And they walked in, proper as you like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Manners mattered, after all. And the pair of them, while certainly unique, attracted less attention than you might think. After all, with a [Lady] whose hair ran like fire, and Antinium about, much less a half-Giant in his seat and a white Gnoll harassing the tables, who was to notice a pair of smartly-dressed sorts?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Anyone with an eye for such things. But everyone was distracted who might pick up on the clues. And the two made no effort to distinguish themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Aside from common courtesy. The shorter one—and he was short compared to the tall fellow who was more brick than man—touched his cap as he sat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're much obliged for the menu, Miss. Might we inquire if there's any specialties of this establishment which we have heretofore not experienced? Somethin' a traveller might appreciate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette blinked at the rougher speech, but the man was polite as could be. She smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pizza's unusual, but if you want something &lt;em&gt;fancier&lt;/em&gt;, the lasagna is always received well. We have small, medium, and large portions. And the ice cream comes from Terandria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, the gelato. I've tasted it myself, so I might have one of these—&lt;em&gt;hamburger&lt;/em&gt; here. And this—blue fruit juice?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The smaller man read very carefully from the menu, taking effort to do it. He wore innocuous, brown clothes, and a floppy cap. Lyonette scribbled down the order and smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you, sir?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe I'll settle for a medium portion of lasagna, this pizza you recommend—and a 'milkshake'. How many…slices would this be?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd say two or three unless you're hungry, sir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette eyed the bigger man, but she was respectful. Because the bigger fellow was rather large, but he had a quite dapper vest and leggings on. And his &lt;em&gt;hat&lt;/em&gt; was in fact somewhat tall. Not as splendiferous as a top hat, but certainly with breathing room for the scalp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had no problem reading, and his voice, deep as it was, was quite thoughtful and quick. The two settled back as Lyonette nodded and got their orders. They blinked when she brought back fries and condiments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, I'm afraid we didn't order this, Miss."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The smaller man was quick to point this out. Lyonette smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, it's on the house for any larger orders! Help yourselves! These are 'french fries'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're much obliged by the hospitality, ma'am. Any place that as gives out free food must be confident in the rest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The smaller man looked happy at the mention of 'free'. He reached for a fry, but then caught himself. He and the bigger man tipped their caps to Lyonette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they didn't remove them. They were only odd in that way—and perhaps their speech. And they were certainly not snobs. They dug into the french fries with a working man's appetite. And exclaimed and savored the new food as most clients did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As normal as could be. Except for the hats. And except, of course, that they were &lt;em&gt;them.&lt;/em&gt; The smaller man remarked as he stared at the door to Invrisil, which was still letting in new people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wilovan, I had a thought."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Only the one?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The smaller man gave a quick scowl at the bigger fellow for the wit. Then he went on, eying the people paying in silver to go through the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Doesn't this put a bit of soot in the eye of all the hard workin' folk who, have so far and probably must continue to travel about the country by horse or foot? And what does that make &lt;em&gt;us,&lt;/em&gt; then? Are we the posh folk who go around with literal magic doors that the regular people can't afford? Is that where we've got to?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The larger fellow raised his brows. He shifted in his chair, delicately munching on a piece of pizza.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One imagines that it would be a sign we've made it, Ratici, my friend. And what sort of people would we be if, for purely moral or philosophical reasons, we did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use a door of such convenience. Because it exists, the door in itself is not an act of classism. However, the way it is used becomes an act that separates the rich and the poor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True. But the inn's using it in such a way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Testily, the shorter fellow snatched a fry away from Wilovan's plate. Silently, Wilovan pushed the rest of the fries towards Ratici. He sighed and cleared his throat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Happily, I noted in the very minutiae of conversation between yon [Butler] and Miss [Innkeeper] that her door had been &lt;em&gt;free for all&lt;/em&gt; up till Lady Reinhart's order. Therefore, we have established that this inn is egalitarian in principle, even if the world forces it to be otherwise."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici, munching on his fries and the hamburger, and rather wishing he'd ordered a slice of pizza, coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True, true. What does 'egalitarian' mean?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Equal for all. You should know it, Ratici. It's a line that goes well with your philosophical talk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan replied steadily. Ratici, as shorter men sometimes did, spoke faster than Wilovan's measured tones, as a man might who was afraid his opinions might not be heard in time or be stomped on. And Ratici tended towards fanciful words as a manner of deliberately heightening his speech, while Wilovan kept up purely as a result of his self-education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Ratici was a bit conscious of that. He sighed as he nibbled from a bit of pizza.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;never needed books to teach me how to be intelligent, Wilovan. Where d'you find all the time to read these books, anyways?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan gave Ratici a look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I notice you've stolen my pizza, Ratici."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll buy you another."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The big man sighed. He waved at Lyonette to effect that at once, rather than let Ratici add it to the list of debts unpaid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As you like. And to answer your question—I read in the recumbent embrace of beautiful women, Ratici. As they or we lie together in their inner sanctums, one finds time to read a book or two. I'm a [Reader]; I can read a book and memorize it in an hour, which is often granted to me as the lady and I must rest before parting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Surely that's a waste of a class in the businesses we find ourselves in, Wilovan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Knowledge should be its own reward, Ratici. But since it affords me classes and levels, I'll happily keep it as a side class. So long as I keep up with you, there's no objection, is there?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"None. Another two pizza slices, Miss? And perhaps some more &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; fries? And—let's have a pair of these 'chocolates'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you sure, sir? They're expensive and small. But a delicacy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici harrumphed. He hated spending too much money on useless things, but food was hardly that and he considered himself an object of paramount value. Too—he hated being seen as stingy. He also hated being seen as lower-class, but he &lt;em&gt;refused&lt;/em&gt; to wear anything that looked 'noble'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was an odd mix of contradictions, Ratici. And his partner, Wilovan, was surprisingly &lt;em&gt;unsimple&lt;/em&gt;, especially to the women he romanced. Of course, he had a preference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods, what a &lt;em&gt;lady.&lt;/em&gt; Did you see, her over yonder?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man stared across the inn. Ratici looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I fail to see her. But knowing your eye—yon [Shield Maiden]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"None other. Shame she's with her child. But what a &lt;em&gt;figure&lt;/em&gt; of a lady."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan sighed, staring at Briganda's form. Ratici rolled his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wilovan, your tastes never fail to amaze me. And what, per se, is wrong with a child?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan looked offended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Only that the poor little fellow shouldn't be forced to wait—much less topics of an intimate nature discussed about him, shouldn't you agree? It would be different in other situations. But given the moment, it would be highly inopportune, rude, and I'd expect any woman as amply gifted as that lady to make the child her priority over any hairy interloper such as I."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll sat back in his chair and adjusted his vest. Ratici swished his long, scaly tail back and forth as he counted his fries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were of course, men. Just a different kind of men than Human men. And they had come through a door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pallass' door. The Gnoll and Drake partnership was a long one, though, and soon they fell to discussing business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It took us longer than we would've liked, coming north on an errand as this. But this door is more boon than not, despite its implications. I'll not miss going around the Bloodfields again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake sighed as he nodded at the door. Wilovan nodded. The Gnoll tapped his furry forefingers together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're late on contract. So the Tall Man might be unhappy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let him. The Brothers didn't tell him we were in the south; nor how fast we move."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici flicked his hands and in so doing, produced the ketchup in its little cup, despite it being right next to Wilovan. The Gnoll didn't react; he was used to Ratici's abilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True enough. Then, you're keen on taking the contract?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Tall Man pays and it seems after this Lady Reinhart business that this is &lt;em&gt;the place&lt;/em&gt; to be. We may also practice our work in Invrisil with minimal effort. Think of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, Wilovan."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have assuredly given it all the thought, Ratici. The proximity to home, the pay, and the distinction all make me inclined to agree. But we may still scope out this work before we accept. And I would like to visit home even if we accept."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll nodded sagely, as did Ratici. &lt;em&gt;Home.&lt;/em&gt; That was Invrisil; they had both been born in the north, a rarity for a Drake and Gnoll among Humans. That they were…not Human wasn't a problem either. Their organization, the Brotherhood of Serendipitous Meetings, wasn't discerning on petty matters like species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A man's conduct was more important. His sense of style—not a universal thing, just his internal &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; of it, and of course, his skill was what mattered in the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the Gentlemen Callers were the best of the best. The Gnoll and Drake wore hats—the floppy one helping with Ratici's neck-spines, and the tall one and vest suiting Wilovan quite well, despite the fur. They stood out in their way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they could be very hard to find as well. So hard that the passing [Mage], on his way back from the outhouse, never noticed them until Ratici leaned around the support beam where they were sitting and called out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Typhenous. You wouldn't happen to be runnin' off, would you now? We've come an awful long way to say hi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Plague Mage…froze. He turned his head slowly and saw them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The hats. The Gnoll and Drake pulled out a chair and Typhenous hesitated. He turned his eyes towards his team, laughing and talking, oblivious in their special corner of the inn. Ratici smiled. With his teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't be shy. We're just here to have a nice chat, as it were, without the tit for the tat in this meeting at least. Take a seat. Can we buy you a drink?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I'm well set. Hello there. You must be…Ratici. And Wilovan."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two smiled. Wilovan touched his hat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You've heard of us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But were you &lt;em&gt;expectin'&lt;/em&gt; us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici looked pointedly at Typhenous. The old man licked his lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And why would I expect the…Gentlemen to pay me a visit?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake smiled and Wilovan sat back, eying his lasagna and wondering if he had to undo a button on his vest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, that might depend. It'd depend whether the Plague Mage owes us a debt or not. In his mind. In our mind, a debt's owed, Mister Plague Mage. And if it were accidental, that'd be one thing. Intentional now…that'd be a serious matter. We're here to have a discussion, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded. Wilovan took over as Ratici sipped at his drink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Words have been spreading from fellows with hats, Mister Typhenous. Unkind words, about a fellow who did us wrong. So says our Nose, and he sniffed around and asked the right sort of questions. Questions that infer you might have all our answers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can assure you I've done everything in my power to help the brothers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous smiled, but palely. Ratici smiled too. His head turned slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Debts are debts nonetheless. But let's talk it over civil-like. Stop whistling for your mates, by the way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raised his claw. The [Thief] had a handful of little glittering things. Spells, little butterflies. Illusions, which should have been untouchable. Typhenous gulped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici was a [Thief]. Well—broadly. Just like Wilovan was a '[Thug]'. But the dapper Gnoll just sat back, looking…patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have no designs on making this a serious matter at the moment, Mister Typhenous. So we'd be kindly inclined if you didn't. And as you know—even if it were an unkind debt you owe, calling it in the most final of ways isn't our style. Repayment takes many forms."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici nodded. He glanced at the Gold-rank adventurers, but not with fear, so much as…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't make us take off our &lt;em&gt;hats&lt;/em&gt;, Typhenous. 'Specially not here, with innocent children about."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Never here. But we would like to discuss the matter, as gentlemen might."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan nodded. So did Typhenous. The two Gentlemen Callers saw the [Mage] relax—slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In that case—as a gentleman, which I hope you see me as—what should I say to assuage your suspicions, sirs?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two looked at each other. Wilovan nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why it happened. And no lies, sir. Just the truth as you see fit to tell us. If it's a poor truth—it must will out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous breathed in and out. And then he spoke, with all the honesty he could muster and as little artifice as he thought he was allowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Would you accept that it was to prevent a certain inn and city from being sacked, Gentlemen Callers? Or at least to let this young [Innkeeper], the child she's taken in, and her friends escape if an army claimed the city by fire and blood? I also gave your friends fair warning; even I didn't expect them to be taken out so…quickly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Gentlemen Callers glanced at each other. A bit surprised by the response. Ratici checked something and nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Interesting. You told them &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous squirmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…may have under exaggerated some of it. But I told all in scope. They seemed to believe the er…Goblins…weren't a threat. Which they were."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A death by omission. A terrible thing. But you &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; it was to aid yon [Innkeeper]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan sat back with a pained sigh. Typhenous nodded, and Ratici glanced at Wilovan, but so swiftly the Plague Mage didn't notice. The Gnoll spoke, lugubriously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We might accept that. Some of our members do not have the kind of vision to see where their actions affect the lives of innocent folk, which is, of course, a thing of honor. And that is a factor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nevertheless, a debt remains."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici pointed out quickly. Typhenous inhaled and exhaled. Wilovan nodded and pinched the bridge of his furry nose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'd better tell us all of it, Plague Mage. But you've run up a debt. Which—frankly speaking, is how it goes. A debt to foil a theft. Which in turn incurs another debt which must be paid. Nothing comes free in our line of work. Tell me though: was it worth it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other two, Drake and Human, listened and nodded. Nothing was for free in their world. Blood debts were avenged, same as money. Typhenous looked from face to face. And he had been tense. But now, in honesty, he spoke, almost relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gentlemen, I will do my best to tell you the truth, since I cannot lie. I most likely do owe a debt. But I do assure you it was to help a young woman who deserved no theft. To save an innocent life. A glorious one, no less."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake and the Gnoll looked at him. In another place, another circle, the words would have provoked laughter and derision. Mockery and disdain, because some people could buy a life with a gold coin or less. But the Gentlemen Callers just nodded and tipped their hats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Well said!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They chorused, and then leaned forwards to collect. For a gentleman was a gentleman, but he always honored his debts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's…good to see you. Again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa du Valeross spoke stiffly to Ceria. The half-Elf nodded. Once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. How's things?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We…sent Isceil's remains to his family. Ulinde's part of the Halfseekers and enjoying it. Beza and I—well, Palt too—we're just at the inn. Doing a bit of Wistram work on the side. You know how it is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…No, not really. Little assignments?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Aegiscaster] shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. Looking into things. Um. You're looking good. Your aura's strong. You've got it under control now, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sort of. I can do &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, but it's not that impressive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria picked up her glass of blue fruit juice. And instantly, it was a smoothie as the cold from her hand enveloped it. Montressa smiled slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Now do that with spells. Pisces had a—deeper mana well. It's fairly impressive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh? Well—he hasn't needed to use it that much. We fought a few natural Golems…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two looked at each other. Ceria's words drifted off. She coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, why don't we call Pisces over? He's not doing anything."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Indeed, the [Necromancer] was trying to imbibe as much as possible as Ksmvr stared at Cade and the boy stared back. Montressa shook her head slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, that's alright. I'll wait—um—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The painful conversation was interrupted by Beza scooting over fast. The Minotauress wasn't that furtive, but she was doing her best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Montressa! Mon—oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw Ceria and hesitated. Montressa saw her old…friend…step back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let me give you a moment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wandered back to her team and was soon engulfed in the laughter. Montressa turned, feeling isolated. But Bezale's eyes were focused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Montressa. I think I just spotted some &lt;em&gt;guests.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? There are tons of—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa had had a few too many drinks. So her mind took a beat longer than it should have. Then she focused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Impossible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You think so? This inn has people from Invrisil in it. And I distinctly heard one group—over there, you see? Seven of them? They were arguing about whether this pizza 'tasted like it did back home'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotauress indicated a group of young folk around Montressa's age. The [Aegiscaster]'s eyes narrowed. They…fit the bill. Around sixteen to twenty six on average, Human…her heart began to beat wildly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Solstice effect."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magus Grimalkin has a theory. I was talking to him about—never mind! If they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; from…we have to do something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Too right. Let's grab them when they go outside to the outhouse, throw them in the prison cube and run for it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bezale cracked her knuckles. Montressa looked askance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bezale!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not taking risks. This would redeem us &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;, Montressa. And then some!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, but you want to start something in this inn? With three Gold-rank teams, Erin, and everyone &lt;em&gt;else?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotauress hesitated. She glanced about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait. Confirm they're guests. And then—find out where they're staying. We make them an offer first, like Erin. They'll jump at it! Come on, we need to get closer…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa began to look for a good place to listen in. Thankfully, Palt wasn't about to interfere—the Centaur was helping cook some food in the kitchen, having been press-ganged into the job by Lyonette. This was their moment. Montressa began to cast a listening spell. It went right past the table with Typhenous and the two men in hats. One of them actually leaned out of the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something wrong, Ratici?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake adjusted his cap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Listening spell. Not on us. Continue."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the inn was merry. Oh, there were any number of little plots, intersecting goals—but it was a party! And that was strange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because Erin Solstice hadn't arranged the party. She was in her room, moodily playing chess. Aside from greeting her friends—she hadn't organized the convivial mood in her inn in any way. Perhaps it was a function of her class—or the reputation of her inn—that her guests instantly began to celebrate any occasion like this. Even without her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then—that was why it was just a nice atmosphere, not Erin Solstice's brand of contagious excitement. The inn depended on the [Innkeeper]. But she was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Upset. Beyond that, really. The young woman came down the stairs, too angry to even continue her game of chess. She walked down and looked around at the happy guests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And felt annoyed they were so &lt;em&gt;happy.&lt;/em&gt; Didn't they know what Magnolia Reinhart had &lt;em&gt;done?&lt;/em&gt; No, some of them even approved. &lt;em&gt;Idiots. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] just stood there as Drassi came over, smiling. The Drake [Bartender] took one look at Erin's face and her smile dropped. She backed up. And Erin Solstice turned her head as Jelaqua wobbled over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin! Erin, come tell the story about Pallass and the Wyverns to the others! They want to hear it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid hesitated. But Erin's expression was inhospitable. And—the atmosphere was spreading. Jelaqua put a hand on Erin's shoulder, recoiled as Erin brushed the hand off. She walked backwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine. Be like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She sat down with a &lt;em&gt;harrumph&lt;/em&gt; at the table. The adventurers fell silent. And the goodwill—began to turn sour. Maviola looked up as Jelaqua ignored Maughin leaning over to talk to her. She &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at Jelaqua. And then she turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Five Families, &lt;em&gt;what—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette felt it too. A sour aura, running through the inn. It came straight from Erin. And it was—powerful. People stopped smiling. They began frowning. That was the power of an [Innkeeper]. And usually it was such a positive force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not this time. The Earthers began arguing at their table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We don't need to buy&lt;em&gt; drinks!&lt;/em&gt; Stop wasting our money!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our money? You mean, my sword!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph snapped at Rose. The two began quarrelling again. Lyonette frowned and concentrated. She tried to push &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt;, but she wasn't Magnolia. And this was Erin's place. Lyonette made her way over to Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin, what are you doing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing. What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] looked up. Her eyes flashed and Lyonette stepped back. Something was wrong. But what?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola was just &lt;em&gt;staring&lt;/em&gt; at Jelaqua. And then Erin. Her eyes were wide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She has it too? But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then her head spun, searching. Maviola saw another figure getting to his feet. And she swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wailant Strongheart was drinking. Or had drunk and was still drinking, rather. But his jovial expression from entering the inn was…changed. He made his way across the inn's floor, shaking off his wife's arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Wailant!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the former [Pirate] was in no mood for reason. He stopped at the adventurer's table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oi. Sailwinds. I want a word about what you said about my crewmates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The laughing adventurers looked up. Seborn smiled, in a good mood for once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;I meant what I said. Obviously. That was a sight. That Drowned Man [Depth Captain]? That was actually my f—&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wailant's fist hit the table. All the dishes and some of the adventurers jumped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take back what you said about [Pirates]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;It was a jest. Why are you taking it personally?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gave Wailant a very odd look. Seborn had said any number of things, but Wailant was the last person he'd have expected to take it personally. But the [Pirate] turned [Farmer] was angry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our ships would've trashed the Underseas Crews in a real fight. Let's settle this, Drowned Man."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He reached for Seborn. The [Rogue] leapt out of his chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you drunk? What's gotten into you? We settled this—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Until you insulted &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;class!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wailant snapped. He went for Seborn, but Moore, Halrac, and Yvlon all grabbed him. They pulled Wailant back as he snarled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry, this isn't like him. I have no idea what—Wailant! Stop disgracing yourself! He's never like this, even when he's at his drunkest!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Viceria hurried forwards. Wailant cursed as the others pulled him back. Yvlon was frowning. Halrac glared. And even Moore's expression turned into a frown as he looked at Seborn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not his fault. Seborn, did you have to be so rude?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Me? They were a seafolk's jests!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn looked incredulously at the half-Giant's frown. But it was spreading. Maviola looked around wildly. No one was seeing this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No, of course not. She slapped her forehead and rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ceria. I'm borrowing this—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grabbed a pitcher of the most potent drink at the table, the Firebreath Whiskey. The half-Elf, distracted, was staring at the fight. Maviola hurried across the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not mad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then why are you speaking like that? And making that face?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette was glaring at Erin. It was on &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;, too. She scowled at Erin as the young woman raised her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm just tired and I'm not in the mood to be &lt;em&gt;friendly &lt;/em&gt;today, alright? Why doesn't everyone just get &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of my inn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her voice quieted the room. The others looked up. And most just stared. But a few—sensed something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wilovan, you feel that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ratici narrowed his eyes at Erin. The Gnoll frowned. He sniffed the air cautiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I suspect I do, but whatever it might be is too elusive for me to pick up. Definitely an aura, but…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was standing. Her eyes flashed with anger. Lyonette was sparking too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't get rid of our customers!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Customers? You mean, your &lt;em&gt;profits!&lt;/em&gt; It's my inn!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two began to clash. The [Princess] narrowed her eyes as Mrsha ran forwards. She bumped into Erin, hugging the [Innkeeper]'s leg. And then she began to glare and try and pull the two adults apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was turning ugly. Moore, Halrac, and Yvlon were snapping at Wailant and their teammates. So was Jelaqua, and now &lt;em&gt;Maughin.&lt;/em&gt; Erin was glaring at Lyonette. She raised a hand to shove the [Princess] aside—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oops! Watch out!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Maviola tripped and threw the entire pitcher of alcohol over the arguing trio. Erin was doused. So was Lyonette, and Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hey! What the heck was—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin whirled. And then &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt; bloomed around her. Mrsha ran, screaming in fear, and Lyonette shouted. Fire! The liquid—the whiskey had ignited as it hit them!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But how? The two stared at each other. The fire was burning on them. But it wasn't burning their skin, or Mrsha's fur. Because the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; fire was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other fire? Erin stared down at her body. Her arms, legs, even her clothes were covered by flames. They were barely visible as the mundane fire licked across her body. But now she saw it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was &lt;em&gt;on fire.&lt;/em&gt; But the flames were—invisible? Erin stared at the burning fire on her arm before the alcohol burned away. Lyonette's entire arm had been engulfed, and so had Mrsha's paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where they'd touched Erin.&lt;/em&gt; Slowly, the [Innkeeper] looked up. Her patrons stared. Then, they whirled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alcohol flew, and water. Mostly it just drenched people. But Jelaqua exclaimed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What the hell is &lt;em&gt;this?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was aflame. Wailant was almost consumed by the magical fire. So were the adventurers who'd touched him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's—your fire. Erin? What did you &lt;em&gt;do?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too shaken to be angry, Lyonette looked at the young woman. And Erin knew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hatred."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola murmured. It burned in her vision. A black flame. Erin tried to explain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—must have conjured it. But why is it &lt;em&gt;invisible? &lt;/em&gt;It should be hot. Burning—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what she thought. But—Erin looked around and realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course it was invisible. Hatred wasn't even that &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;—no one was being burned physically by it. But it was all-consuming. It spread, from person to person. An insidious flame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And—she saw Viceria beating at the fire on Wailant, Jelaqua pouring water on her arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was so hard to put &lt;em&gt;out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Make it stop! It's burning Mrsha!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The flames were beginning to eat away at the finest hairs on the tips of Mrsha's fur. Erin realized her skin was…hurting. She reached for Mrsha, but the Gnoll recoiled as Lyonette grabbed her with her free arm, and brushed at the invisible flames.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop it, Erin!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know &lt;em&gt;how!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] looked around. And she felt the hatred burning on her skin. She fought against it. But how did you get rid of it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pull it back to you. It's yours."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone spoke. Erin's head turned. But she didn't see who it was. Still—the words were &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. She concentrated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come back. Come back, right &lt;em&gt;now—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Across the inn, the black flame winked out. Jelaqua gasped as she stared at her dead flesh—the flames had eaten away at her dead body fastest. She looked up. No flames on her, or Wailant. The [Pirate] relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Storms at sea. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; that—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Every head turned to Erin. The young woman was engulfed in the fire. From head to toe. It did not burn on the floorboards as she stepped back from Lyonette and Mrsha. It only thrived on living things. And now it was visible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A dancing, dark flame, like a shadow in the light. Lyonette held Mrsha as she backed away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin? Can you put it out? Someone—get some water!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nearly reached for Erin, but someone—a young woman with black and red hair, put an arm out. And Erin Solstice turned. She saw Ishkr grab a glass of water and hurl it at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The water burned away as it landed on the fire. Lyonette saw Erin regarding her hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can we help?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I'm fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, the shrouded young woman looked up. Her eyes burned behind the black veil. They flashed as she looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're not fine. We need to put that out—I'll try my magic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria stood up. Erin glanced at her friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No. Sit down.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf froze, and slowly her legs collapsed. Erin Solstice looked around. And then she walked towards the magic door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going for a walk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached for the magic door, adjusted the dial, and opened it. Walked through. The flames engulfed her. Her hatred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But that was right. That was what she &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt;. Not a damn &lt;em&gt;party.&lt;/em&gt; She needed strength. Magnolia. Erin narrowed her eyes. She walked forwards. Sergeant Kel backed up in his checkpoint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let me through."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake opened his mouth. Erin Solstice looked at him. She grabbed the portcullis. And the steel—slowly—began to heat &lt;em&gt;up.&lt;/em&gt; Warp. The [Sergeant] looked at Erin. He turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Raise the gates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sir?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Guard] looked at Kel incredulously. The [Sergeant] snapped as he stared at Erin and the dark, almost invisible fire. It was only visible under the light. In the shadows, it just made her form ripple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Open the gate. And send a runner to the Watch Captain, Grand Strategist, and—&lt;em&gt;Saliss of Lights. &lt;/em&gt;Run!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The gates opened. Erin Solstice strode through. She turned, and walked down the street. The flames were invisible on her in the darkening night. But people avoided her. The look on the Human woman's face cleared her way in the already emptying streets as she walked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Listening to the sound of hatred whispering in her ears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was being consumed by it. Maviola tried to go after Erin, but the [Sergeant] refused to let anyone else through. She hesitated. But it was the young woman's fire. It wouldn't kill her. Maviola just hoped it wouldn't consume her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She'll be alright. I'll go after her. Mrsha, stay &lt;em&gt;here.&lt;/em&gt; Mister Kel, let me through!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette went after Erin. The others stood still, murmuring. But without the flame and Erin—the inn was returning to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something crazy &lt;em&gt;each time &lt;/em&gt;I come here. I tell you, that's our crazy Human."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Drake joked. There was laughter, nervous. But aside from Erin's friends, people were relaxing. And as Ceria, Pisces, Jelaqua, Maughin, and a few others hurried after Lyonette to Pallass, the others sat back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm uh—anyone going to Liscor? Wailant? Are you alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi looked at the [Pirate]. He laughed, a bit shakily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing burned, Miss Drassi. Apologies, Seborn. That was a hell of a fire, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;No offense taken.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Man nodded warily. Drassi began adjusting the door, letting some people through and out. She opened the door to Liscor—and blinked at her next guests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh! Olesm! &lt;em&gt;Councilmembers?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello, Drassi. We'd like a private table."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia smiled at Drassi. Elirr was with her, and behind her, Guildmistress of the Mage's Guild, Alonna. And—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; discussing the matter, Silverfang! The council session is not over! Bah! And this inn's at the heart of it all!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism strode through the door, tail lashing the ground. The Councilmembers glowered, but they nodded as Drassi looked about hurriedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can put you at the table at the back over there—um! Oh, hi, Olesm. Are you sitting with…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Drassi. Is Erin here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Strategist] entered the inn. Olesm, blue-scaled, tail hung low, was exhausted. As the four Councilmembers marched over to the table, still bickering, Olesm deliberately hung back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wow. You look tired."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi was adjusting the door to Esthelm. Olesm nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Council's been in session for hours. Well—they're still talking. Jeiss and Raekea had to go, but…Ancestors, you heard about what happened, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Gossip] nodded, not quite comprehending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That Lady Reinhart found out how many Antinium were living under the city and other stuff, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's putting it mildly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm's stomach was in knots. The Antinium were &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; even the largest estimates he'd seen. And they had a tunnel that led southwards? They could &lt;em&gt;sack&lt;/em&gt; Liscor anytime they wanted. And the Walled Cities were in a panic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The only reason they'd let Liscor's Council and Olesm go was because they clearly thought the Council and Olesm were idiots who hadn't known anything about the Antinium. And they were &lt;em&gt;right.&lt;/em&gt; Watch Captain Zevara was getting grilled—and Olesm?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He just wanted to talk to Erin. It had been so long since he'd come here. He didn't feel…welcome anymore. Not after the election. That had been his choice. But…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd really like to speak to Erin, if she's here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake looked hopefully at Drassi. She sucked in her breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ooh. You know, she was just here. But there was this thing with black fire and uh—not a good time? She's in Pallass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pallass? Oh—fine. But let her know I'd really like to talk? If she has time?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm sighed. Drassi nodded sympathetically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you want to sit with the Horns?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're here? Ceria's here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm brightened. He looked around and saw—Yvlon and Ksmvr, talking anxiously. But no Ceria. Drassi winced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ceria's gone too. She went after Erin—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] eyed Ksmvr and Yvlon. He sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll sit alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh! Well, sorry—I'll let you know when anyone comes over!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi called out after Olesm. She went back to the magical door, adjusted it to Invrisil and blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ancestors! Um. &lt;em&gt;Hello!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm found a seat next to the Councilmembers. The four of them were still talking. Lism was speaking to Krshia, Elirr, and Alonna. And for once, they weren't in disagreement, just shock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That was a &lt;em&gt;disgrace. &lt;/em&gt;A [Lady] can just—walk into our city and take command? She overwhelmed us! I felt it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alonna nodded. The [Mage] was shaken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If that was a brawl, that was the two of them pinning us down while that [Lady] stomped our faces in. I couldn't &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;. I didn't even think! I was just—watching. I don't know how you and Krshia even moved, Lism—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bah. We didn't do anything. And I'll say this. Damn that Reinhart, but she helped us. Don't give me that look, Silverfang! I can admit that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism sat back. He gulped from his mug. His claw was trembling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Antinium. They have a &lt;em&gt;tunnel&lt;/em&gt;. And they're in our city. I was right."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia was subdued. She looked pale under her fur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They have taken no…action."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't give me &lt;em&gt;that!&lt;/em&gt; You saw their numbers! And they're flouting every rule in the treaty! They have a &lt;em&gt;tunnel to the other Hives.&lt;/em&gt; This—this could have been the beginning of them sacking the city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Councilmembers fell silent. Not even Krshia could find a response to that. It was true. The Antinium could have marched all six Hives into Liscor. And no one had known but Magnolia Reinhart. Lism drank again. And his voice was surprisingly steady.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;? We can't allow this anymore. I say—we find as much room in the budget as we can. Damn the army—we &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; the funds and approach…Fissival? We need [Enchanters] over Level &lt;em&gt;50&lt;/em&gt; here today! We need to double Watch Captain Zevara's budget."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And the Antinium? Do we kick them out of the city?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alonna looked around. Olesm raised his head anxiously. Lism was nodding, but it was Elirr who raised a paw. The Council were being served food, but they weren't that hungry despite not having eaten dinner. The [Beast Trainer] looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We must take precautions. But regarding removing the Antinium—even if we agreed. Could we?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dead silence. The Council looked at each other. Remove the Antinium? In what world did the Antinium just pack up and leave? Lism growled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have to prepare the city. Fortify it against an attack. Can we—reinforce the ground so they can't tunnel up through the streets?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They could collapse the city. At least—parts of it that aren't magically reinforced. That's what one of the [Engineers] in Pallass was saying. How did we not know? How did Magnolia Reinhart…? And what do we do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alonna murmured. The Councilmembers were reaching for their food, trying to think, when a figure slithered up to their table and spoke brightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. If you're debating securing the city, I have some thoughts on the matter. It might be outside your budget, but I can certainly make accommodations to my design."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Drakes and Gnolls looked up. Their jaws dropped. Lism recoiled, and the figure standing or rather—coiled in front of their table smiled brightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good evening. This is a fortuitous meeting, isn't it? I hope I'm not interrupting, but that polite Drake told me you were Liscor's Council. Hello! A pleasure to meet you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What in the name of the walls are &lt;em&gt;you?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism sat back in his seat. Because the figure in the inn was an anomaly in Liscor. In southern Izril for that matter. He was…a Lizardperson. But not just any Lizardperson. Rarer still, even in Baleros.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Lamia smiled at the group, ignoring the looks of horror or amazement from the others in the inn. He was short—well, average height, when 'standing'. But his lower, serpentine half was long, trailing behind him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lamia's scales were larger than a Drake's, but he possessed two human-like arms; and a more bipedal upper body. Unlike a Naga, who was larger, stronger, or a Gorgon who was even more imposing still, the Lamia's body was agile. A form suited for intelligence, spellcasting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His gaze was certainly quick, and the Lamia seemed to be appraising each member of the Council in turn. His eyes flicked to Olesm as the Drake stared at him, but he nodded politely to the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. I'm the [Architect]. Hexel Quithail, at your service."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bowed slightly, his body undulating with the graceful motion. Lism's eyes widened and Krshia stood up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Master Quithail. We apologize, yes? We had no idea you were here. I am Krshia Silverfang."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lamia beamed. He had a scar on one cheek, Olesm saw. And his reptilian eyes were bright. Olesm saw a trio of nervous Lizardfolk hurrying over behind him. Carrying a number of bags along with their personal bags of holding. They huddled together behind their master as Hexel gestured towards them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all. Not at &lt;em&gt;all.&lt;/em&gt; Miss Silverfang of the Council of Liscor, I presume? I apologize for the delay; I landed at Zeres, but I had to sail north and disembark in Human lands. Lady Reinhart kindly escorted me to Invrisil and assured me I'd have transport."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured at the door, smiling widely as he shook Krshia's paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How incredible. Is this magical door property of Liscor? Or the inn? Ah, but the events of today were also quite dramatic. Antinium under the city? I have my work cut out for me, clearly. I would deeply love to see the maps of their tunnels—I can rework the city in some ways to avoid deliberate sabotage. But again, that will require some redesign. But I do apologize, I'm talking too much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had that chatty way of most Lizardfolk about him. The Council blinked, but then Elirr rose and offered his paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Elirr Fultpar. It is an honor to meet you, Master Quithail."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hexel, please. We'll be working together."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lamia beamed at Elirr. Alonna rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Guildmistress Alonna of the Mage's Guild. Hello."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel turned to her. He smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Charmed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He did not take her claw. Lism looked at Hexel with obvious distaste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's good to meet you…Mister Hexel. Our [Builders] have been working according to your designs. But this latest incident has…changed things. This isn't an official meeting of the Council, but we welcome your input. Please. Sit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded a few times, still looking warily at Hexel. And the Lamia smiled. With his teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you. Councilmember Lism, I presume? I was delighted to be offered the job to build a city like Liscor especially given the weather conditions when I received it. However—before I sit, and indeed, begin my work, may I have a few words on the matter of…security?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Security?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Councilmembers blinked. Hexel smiled and gestured to his crew of three Lizardpeople. They stared at the Drakes. And Olesm saw Hexel's eyes flicker to him, Lism, Alonna.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed. I'd heard Drakes didn't like Lizardpeople, but I wasn't aware of how badly that truism ran. Did I mention I first disembarked at Zeres? Well, I was heading north to Liscor. As it happens, Drakes slaughtered half of my [Assistants] and gave me &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; scar."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He touched the scar running down his face. The table fell quiet. Lism's jaw opened and stayed open. The Lamia went on. And his smile widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So, while I'm fully delighted to be working on a project like this, I must insist on [Bodyguards]. And if this inn is open? Yes, I'd prefer to stay &lt;em&gt;here. &lt;/em&gt;And I insist on protection for me and my people. Non-Drakes. Gnolls or Humans, preferably. Without that, I will be returning to Invrisil and Baleros this moment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at the table. Alonna, Lism—both Drakes looked astounded. Krshia's eyes were wide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Master Hexel—we had no idea. What happened? Were they [Bandits] or…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They were Drakes. More than that, I think they simply objected to Lizardfolk. Astounding, really. Zeres was pleasant, but the further north I went…it was rather reminiscent of the scene in Chandrar, actually. You recall, with the Gnolls? Drakes attacked my party. I was forced to kill the rest after the ambush."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Architect] looked about. And his eyes focused coldly on Lism's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I trust that will not happen here? In fact, I will ensure it will not."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course not. We're not about to &lt;em&gt;kill &lt;/em&gt;you&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;that was bandits."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism looked rattled. The Lamia shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just as you say. But I have your word on bodyguards?&lt;em&gt; Now?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Council stared at each other and then nodded. Krshia spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have our word, Master Hexel. We will arrange it. Absolutely. And let me apologize for…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She trailed off. The Lamia smiled at the Gnoll. Olesm just looked at Hexel's assistants. They stared at him and the other Drakes, clearly terrified. And his chest felt tight. Lizardfolk. Of course they were…lizards. But they'd been attacked for being…? Or was it [Bandits]?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel just nodded at Krshia. He smiled again, and slithered over to the table. He didn't sit, but rather reclined on his lower half. And he beamed. But again—with that &lt;em&gt;edge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excellent. Now that little matter is settled—I will make other provisions tomorrow, as we settle the matter. But for now, let's get to work. Blueprints!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured and a Lizardman hurried forwards with a map of Liscor. Hexel produced a wand, waved it. All the dishes on Lism and Alonna's side went scooting away as the map was unrolled. He addressed the Council.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you would like to discuss security for your city, it's rather been on my mind as well. However, I am &lt;em&gt;delighted&lt;/em&gt; to speak with you all. Tell me more about yourselves! And if you wouldn't mind—I am famished."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He waved and Ishkr strode over. His apprentices were seated at another table, and Hexel, smiling, ordered and began to chat. He leaned over to Krshia and Elirr, rather ignoring Lism and Alonna. The two Drakes were speechless anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So was Olesm. He looked at Hexel, but what could you say? Olesm was biting his tongue as he remembered well—Lizardpeople jokes. No, it had to be [Bandits]. It was just dislike. No one was actually going to go out and kill a Lizardperson over that grudge. Right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Surely not. Olesm had to stand up and look for Ceria and Erin. But they were still gone. Some people were discussing what had happened. Olesm found a Human [Mage] and a Minotaur. He vaguely recognized them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. You wouldn't know what happened to Erin, would you? I'm a friend. I was hoping to talk to her…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa and Beza looked up from their covert observation of the Earthers. Montressa nodded to the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's in Pallass. Something to do with her magical fire gone wrong."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Her…magical fire? Oh, right. That. Uh—gone wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm blinked a few times. The [Strategist] wondered if something was caught in his earholes. Montressa gave him an odd look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Her magical fire. Anyways, she's gone. The other adventurers know more about it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed. Olesm hesitated. He didn't know the other adventurers as well as…Ceria and the Horns. He ducked his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, well, thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He walked past them. As she did, Bezale leaned over to Montressa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who was &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt; Not one of Erin's regulars. You know him, Montressa?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Aegiscaster] whispered back, a bit too loudly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No idea. He might be new. You know, Erin makes a lot of friends."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist]'s shoulders hunched. He stopped heading over to the adventurers and scuttled back to his table. Then he put his head down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strategist Olesm of Liscor. That's me. New guest of the inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He muttered into the table. And only the [Lady] with fire in her hair heard him. Olesm waved for a drink. Why had it all gone wrong? He'd just tried to do what was best for Liscor. And the worst part?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He'd been right. But it hadn't been enough. The Antinium. Olesm clenched one claw into a fist. What was he supposed to do? Be nice to them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They could wipe out Liscor. He was supposed to be one of the people who would stop them from doing that. But how did you stop The Black Tide?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was no Zel Shivertail. And now—Erin didn't even speak to him anymore. Olesm tried to cure this with the only medicine he had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lots and lots of alcohol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She walked, aflame, through the City of Inventions. The invisible fire flickered by moonlight. But she kept it burning. She let it feed on her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice welcomed the flame. She didn't need to be &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; now. She didn't want to put a smile on what Magnolia Reinhart had done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wanted to hate. She'd lost again. And Magnolia Reinhart would pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Take the hatred. Let it burn her. Let it become her weapon. Erin Solstice walked up the steps, and people flinched away from her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] was weak. But her fire—it could be a weapon. One that could burn even Magnolia's smile away. Erin wanted to &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So she walked, along the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor. And she thought of all the ways you could hurt someone. Stab them, burn them, pull out their eyes. Burn their faces off with oil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some people deserved to die. &lt;/em&gt;That was what the fire whispered to her. And Erin agreed. She wanted a weapon. So she walked towards the one who could make it for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf. Why hadn't she carried an acid jar on her? She could have thrown it at Magnolia. What would happen if Ressa tried to block &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt; Could you pump it through a hose? A sprinkler?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one was going to take her friends from her again. And this fire—this was power. Like the night she had made the faerie's meal. Erin felt the power coursing through her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because her magic was intention, will, emotion. And the moment. One of the moons shone down on her. The other was shrouded, dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Give me a knife."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pelt had said he could forge something far better than the steel knife she carried. Erin wanted it. Use her flame. And give her a knife that could &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His forge was still lit, a small glow among the few other forges at night. He was still there. Erin's darkest voices whispered in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make me a knife made of hatred and flame. To cut away my weakness, my enemies, my shame. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pelt. Where are you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin strode into the forge. She saw a single flame, lit in one of the forges. Just for light. An anvil shone. There was a tiny, pointed chisel, lying on top of it. The tip was as fine as could be. Erin looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Pelt! &lt;/em&gt;I want—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give me a weapon to make a monster out of me. A weapon so terrible the world will flee—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then she found him. Erin Solstice halted. The Dwarf was lying on his back, behind the anvil. Erin's eyes went round. Pelt held a small mallet in one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes were wide, his mouth agape. Gasping for air, but his lungs didn't move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mithril coin lay next to him. Erin's black flames—flickered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pelt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf was twitching. The coin—glittered in the moonlight. It lay on the ground, where Pelt had dropped it. And Erin saw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf had begun restoring it. Erin saw a shining city. Half re-made, the tiny, delicate details given clarity by Pelt's metalworking tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An empire. Symbols of an old nation. A sun rose behind a city. But that was not where it had stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Around the rim of the coin were words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Letters, delicate. But visible. Erin read them in between Pelt's choking. A phrase on the minted coin. Or an epitaph to a long-forgotten kingdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So old that the mithril had worn with time. And yet, Pelt, the master, had restored it. Almost all of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the words. Shone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tamaroth, Who Leads. The G— of Rulers. Protect Us in Our Weakness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That one word. Pelt had managed to recreate a single letter of it. But the rest was—scratched out. His shaking hand, so perfectly steady in everything else, had damaged the rest of the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice saw this all in a moment, between the Dwarf's seizing chest, clawed hands. That one word. The flames around her went out. She looked at Pelt. His eyes were wide. He wasn't &lt;em&gt;breathing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She took the coin and shoved it in a pocket. And then she screamed for help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Later. The flames were gone. Erin Solstice sat, shaking, in Pelt's forge. The Dwarf was breathing. Coughing. But breathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alive. Saliss knelt next to him—and Ceria, Pisces—Venim—all the people who'd come after Erin. [Smiths] too—the Watch was keeping them back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The important part was that Pelt was alive. Alive. Erin had found him scarcely a minute after he'd collapsed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working on the coin. &lt;/em&gt;The scratched out word burned in Erin's head. The coin felt red-hot in her pocket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her flames of hatred were extinguished. Erin hugged Pelt as he coughed and pushed her off him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm so—glad you're okay. And I'm so sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I just froze up. I started breathing! You didn't need to pound on my damn chest!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Blacksmith] coughed again. He'd started breathing after the coin was removed. Saliss was offering Pelt a bottle of compressed air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Breathe into this. What happened?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin opened and closed her mouth. But the Dwarf just thrust aside the bottle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just an accident at the forge. Too many damn distractions. That was all. I needed a break. Somewhere quieter to work. Said it for years."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He and she said nothing of the coin. Pelt didn't even look at Erin. Trembling, he put his tools away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Big fuss over nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Watch Captain Venim sighed. Pelt passed a hand over his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing. I saw nothing. Can't even remember. If I think of it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His breath caught in his throat. He choked—everyone reached for him. But the Dwarf started breathing again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing happened."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His gaze was blank. Nothing. Erin met his eyes for a moment. She backed away and Pelt looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why did you come here, Erin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wanted to…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd wanted a knife. But Erin—her desire was extinguished along with the dark thoughts. The hatred was gone. She had looked into Pelt's face and been terrified for him. She was…she liked to believe she couldn't kill like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But part of her knew otherwise. Something had to change. She'd been blindsided by Magnolia because the [Lady] had planned for her. And Erin—she hadn't. It was as simple as that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Vision. Magnolia had once told Erin something like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Save the world. But Erin couldn't even beat Magnolia at Magnolia's game. At chess, yes. But Magnolia's board was vaster than Erin's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;How did you fight Magnolia Reinhart? Erin sat in Pelt's forge as the Dwarf coughed, already forgetting, snarling that he was &lt;em&gt;fine. &lt;/em&gt;And Erin, shaken, looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For something. Her eyes settled on Saliss. The Named-rank adventurer was naked as always. You almost forgot about that. He grinned at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. You always show up at the right moment, don't you? That's an adventurer's trick."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin tried to smile. She looked around, and then sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Want to go to my inn? Drinks are on me, Saliss, Pelt. And a free round for everyone else."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at her. But the [Innkeeper] just smiled wanly. And the others smiled back. Because that was Erin's power. Her real power, that was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Soon, they were back in the inn. Lyonette relaxed and Erin went around, apologizing to her friends. She put Pelt in a private table and loaded him up with drinks—despite that probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being the most sound medical move. But the Dwarf was happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Erin owed him a debt. Saliss followed Erin into the inn on her insistence. He grinned as he saw Octavia and Revi exclaiming over Revi's stiches. Revi glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oi! Naked Drake! Put some pants on—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes widened as she recognized Saliss. Her jaw dropped. And Erin elbowed Saliss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't leave just yet. I have something I want to talk to you about."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at her with a bright smile. And saw right through her. Erin Solstice looked around. She breathed in and out. And then she put on a happy expression. And she made herself—cheerful. And the inn followed suit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Why did she throw a party even in her darkest hours? Erin Solstice walked around, talking to people. Making them feel welcome, joking about the invisible flame, apologizing. And why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because it wasn't about her. She was an [Innkeeper]. And her guests came to her inn for what she gave them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] saw it all. And approved. Just &lt;em&gt;look!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Players of Celum and the Players of Liscor were coming back. They entered the inn with an explosion of sound, a babble of voices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dead gods! I've never seen acting like that!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Temile was dumbstruck. He looked at Jasi and Wesle with awe. And even a bit of fear. The [Actors] were radiant as Wesle and Jasi laughed. Emme was hugging Kilkran's side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We did it! The [Ladies] loved the performance! All of them! They were &lt;em&gt;bidding&lt;/em&gt; to have us perform in their lands! &lt;em&gt;Private&lt;/em&gt; performances—we can go on the road—this is it! We've made it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf [Manager]'s eyes were shining. She didn't think to keep her voice down. The [Actors] turned as Erin overheard. Wesle faltered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Erin—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You did well? You're going to be sponsored and stuff? Hey, that's great."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin smiled. And she meant it. Jasi exchanged a look with Wesle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We owe you everything, Erin. You have to see us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was the most impressive performance I've seen, Erin. I think I might level just from having seen them!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Temile was babbling. He had tears in his eyes. Erin wistfully smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wish I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; seen it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have a booth reserved just for you. We'll perform tomorrow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kilkran was stroking his beard as he spoke—he was wearing a wig over his bald head, a rather good one. But then—Wesle looked across the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At the stage. The [Grand Theatre] waited. And the [Actor] cleared his throat. The others looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kilkran. Why do we need to &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; for a stage? Our first one—well, one of the first—is here already."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Players of Celum turned. And they looked at their old stage. Erin's head rose as Jasi, resplendent in her dress, twirled and looked at her cast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course! &lt;em&gt;Players of Celum! &lt;/em&gt;I believe it's time for an encore. With all of us! What say you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Actors] glanced at each other. And then they rushed towards the stage. Erin saw Wesle leap onto the stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Which play?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Do them all!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Relc shouted. He was wide-eyed as the high-level [Actors] fussed about, ushering their Gnoll and Drake counterparts into place, debating. Eltistiman walked forwards, flicking his wand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both Liscor's crowd and Invrisil's stared through the doorway. The magical door promptly went out as Invrisil's patrons tried to flood through. And the Players of Celum began to &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Erin said. The first play they did was &lt;em&gt;Juliet and Romeo.&lt;/em&gt; A classic, the very first they'd done. And Wesle was playing Romeo, and Jasi, Juliet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin remembered the first play, full of half-remembered lines, awkward [Actors] who didn't know how to face the audience. But still with that spark, buried among the lines. The magic of the stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Now, that magic &lt;em&gt;shone.&lt;/em&gt; You could believe the love story, see it amid you. Erin wiped at one eye as she stared at the stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But they just did a performance. They're exhausted."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emme whispered as she watched. And that was true. The Players were tired. Some voices were hoarse. Erin's stage was smaller, the set less grandiose. The other [Actors] from the Players of Liscor who were joining in lower-level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But still, the [Actors] shone. Temile looked at the stage. And he had seen the best performance of his life an hour ago. The best—until the one tonight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll never recapture this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He murmured, looking at the [Actors], striding about on the stage. The audience watched, laughing, enraptured, gasping at the fight scenes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Look at it, lightning in a bottle. Erin looked at Jasi, shining, and remembered the [Washer] whom she'd met in Celum. How could they be one and the same? But because they were—it was glorious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She walked around her inn, as the guests turned and smiled. Greeting people. Slowly moving towards her destination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Solstice, I presume? The Council of Liscor has hired me. My name is Hexel Quithail. Might I ask if my three apprentices and I could stay at your inn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Lamia, a half-snake person addressed Erin. She blinked at him. And then smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of &lt;em&gt;course!&lt;/em&gt; Hey, are you a…um…snake-person? That's totally cool."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hexel blinked at his serpentine half. And then—the [Architect] began to laugh with genuine amusement for the first time. The three scared apprentices forgot their nerves and fell over themselves laughing. Hexel assured Erin he was. And she grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, &lt;em&gt;Lamia.&lt;/em&gt; Right! Of course you can stay! We just built some new rooms, so they're a bit rough…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Well, I happen to be an [Architect], Miss Solstice. Lovely inn you have. Could use some changes to accommodate for the Skills. And is that a secret Garden I spotted?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman went on, shaking hands, speaking to people. And the Gentlemen Callers found her at their table. She smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, how are you two doing? Can I get you anything? Nice hats."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why, thank you miss. And we're quite well set up ourselves. But it's a kind word you have for us, and a lovely play!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wilovan touched his hat. Erin blinked at the unique speech, but then beamed at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Glad you like it! Let me know if I can do anything! Oh—and we're serving a special drink. The Minotaur's Punch. Try it later!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bar was lighting up with her fire of glory as Erin conjured some for Drassi. The duo glanced after Erin. Wilovan murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. What a nice young lady. Not that I'd speculate, but whatever would the Tallman want with her?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I suspect we'll find out. But insofar as we've seen, Wilovan? Who wouldn't want to know more about an establishment such as this? Let's try that drink."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were unprepared for the shot of memory. Even them, the famous duo. The [Actors] shone on stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin stopped at the last table on her route. She'd saved Saliss for last. Pelt was snorting and waving off her apology; he was drinking and looking around the inn, thoughtfully. And Saliss of Lights was smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was drinking the Minotaur's Punch. He looked at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hear you had another fire. And &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;wasn't here to see it! Then again—I also hear it wasn't the best one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was stupid fire. I don't think anyone should have it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin sat down at the table. She looked at Saliss. And wondered about him. But Saliss smiled. And Erin felt a kinship, of sorts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did you beat Magnolia Reinhart?&lt;/em&gt; The question was in her head. By making plans, thinking ahead. But you had to do it well. And—she looked at the stage. At Saliss, a person who could bottle that lightning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Say, Saliss?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yes, &lt;/em&gt;my lovely Erin Solstice?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He fluttered his eyes at her. Erin smiled and rolled her eyes. Because they both looked at each other and saw the other was pretending. To be happy. To be helpful, even when they didn't feel it. Because, fundamentally, they believed in good things. So Erin took a deep breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, Octavia tells me you use up a lot of ingredients when you experiment. And I'm not saying I have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of them. But if I had some…flowers. Do you think you'd be able to make something with them? For a price."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Alchemist]'s eyes widened. Erin met his gaze, serious. Because you had to prepare for the future. The Named Adventurer sat back. And his eyes glittered as he imagined what could be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And also waving the flowers in front of Xif's shop until the Gnoll cried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was wrong. That was what Maviola thought. So close, and yet so far. The [Lady] looked around Erin's inn and saw genius.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What a beautiful inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Firestarter gazed at The Wandering Inn and beheld it all fully. Like the fire she had seen on Erin, she saw all of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Look at this place. Gold-rank adventurers and Hobgoblins just as fierce, sitting together in this inn with Antinium and a &lt;em&gt;Named-rank&lt;/em&gt; Adventurer?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice had made only one mistake. And that was going to Pelt for her knife. Going to Saliss with her flowers. That was thinking like Magnolia Reinhart. But this? She was nearly there in Maviola's mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly.&lt;/em&gt; And she thought she was &lt;em&gt;weak?&lt;/em&gt; Ridiculous! The strongest [Lady] in Izril had been forced to ambush her with allies just to get her way. Who else could lay such a claim?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice didn't need a weapon. This was her power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not fighting. Not wrath or hatred or war. Just this. Tending to the fire. The [Lady] sighed. Didn't she realize? Perhaps that too was her strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But look at all these burning flames. She had blown on the embers, and now they shone. How glorious. Like her flame. The [Lady] raised the glass and drank. Her eyes burned as she closed them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Still. The young woman&lt;em&gt; was&lt;/em&gt; young. And not all flames burned bright. She didn't tend to them all equally. But again—she was also an [Innkeeper]. Maviola took even more to fire than Erin Solstice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she saw the burning souls of all in the inn. So, the [Lady] looked around and saw flames that could be nurtured. Low spirits. She made her way to one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not blazing. Erin's fire was the one that shone in this inn, and two flames only distracted the eye. Maviola was a dull glow besides Erin. She didn't need to steal the stage like an [Actor] or Magnolia. She knew the value of warmth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello. Mind if I have a seat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Drake looked up from his half-drunken stupor. Olesm was kicking himself. He'd tried to apologize and talk to Erin as she passed by his table, but she was &lt;em&gt;busy.&lt;/em&gt; He blearily looked at Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Huh? No. Sure. I mean—have a seat. The table's open."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola sat. Olesm tried to drag himself into some semblance of…anything. And he felt warmer, all of a sudden. He blinked as he sobered. The [Lady] looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry. I'm new in Liscor. I just came from Invrisil. You were looking depressed, so I couldn't help but come over."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You just…walk over to sad people in bars?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman laughed. Olesm felt bad about the snippy question. But she smiled and the smile was infectious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why not? Haven't you tried it? Everyone has a story. Also—I may have heard you were the [Strategist] of Liscor. A lot's happened, hasn't it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;That's&lt;/em&gt; an understatement. Yes, I'm Olesm Swifttail, nice to meet you. I was hoping to play some chess with the [Innkeeper] here. But I'm something of a pariah these days."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola nodded, listening. Olesm felt embarrassed, whiny. But something about her reminded him of the old Drake who had raised him before he'd come to Liscor. An openness that didn't judge. She leaned over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Chess? I've played a few times. [Strategists] love that game, don't they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, yes. And Erin's one of the best in the world."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm saw Maviola laugh incredulously. He sat up, indignant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She &lt;em&gt;is!&lt;/em&gt; I can't even beat her. But—well—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Erin, sitting with Saliss. The [Strategist] grimaced. And Maviola followed his gaze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Surely someone else can play the game. Speaking of plays—that's some glorious performance on the stage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She indicated the Players of Celum, who'd taken an intermission. The inn shone in Maviola's eyes. And Olesm perked up. He glanced at the stage—Wesle was shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And now, a unique performance never played in Liscor—&lt;em&gt;Elisial!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crowd went wild. Relc pushed people out of the way as he dragged his daughter to the front row seats. Grev was trying to tell Mrsha and Cade about it as the boy made little magical apparitions come out of his magical box. Mrsha was staring in awe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was talking to Saliss. Numbtongue had found Octavia with Revi and was talking animatedly about fabrics, which he had an opinion on to both Stitchgirl's surprise. Or rather, Pyrite did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jelaqua, Maughin, and Ulinde had approached Hexel and were exclaiming as the Lamia and his crew brightened to see fellow Balerosians. Kevin was trying to explain peacocks and penguins to Bird, who was buying him drinks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The inn brightened around Olesm as he came out of his funk. He looked at Maviola. And realized she'd helped him with that. Slowly, the [Strategist] looked around. And there was Belgrade, playing chess with Lyonette as Pawn gave her tips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Why hadn't he seen any of this? He was so focused on &lt;em&gt;Erin.&lt;/em&gt; But now, the [Lady] laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can play chess too. Why don't we play a game? And you can tell me about Liscor. Do you know—I've &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; visited Liscor? Never gone further than Wales."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Well, that's not surprising. Most Humans don't go further than Celum. Esthelm's practically in the middle of nowhere. Besides, you're quite young…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm wondered why Maviola laughed so hard at that. But he found himself pulling a chess board over. Absently, he began to play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm actually a decent player. I run a chess magazine. I haven't updated in a while…this inn has all kinds of entertainment. The plays, drinks…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I saw. So what's your job?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Managing the city. It's boring—well, it used to be. But I'm still not doing much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? A [Strategist] who doesn't do much? Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a Watch Captain. And a Council. I just give advice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. So you're just not doing your job?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm blinked. Maviola gave him a steady look. The Drake found himself clarifying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, I mean, I have ideas. But we have the budget to think of, and we can't just shake things up—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What ideas?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—I have a number of proposals, but I don't want to get into them—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Like &lt;em&gt;what,&lt;/em&gt; exactly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake opened and closed his mouth. He peered at Maviola. And the [Lady] moved a piece.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Check, by the way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Olesm looked down at his board. She winked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin talked with Saliss for a while. Then she went into her garden, uprooted a flower, and handed it to him. She sat in her inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Better. Not full of angry fire. Still upset. But better. Erin sighed to herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One step at a time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The coin burned in her pocket. And Erin had a supposition. Or perhaps it had just been a dream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But where had the coin come from?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around her inn. And shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods. Dead gods…what a day."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around. People were applauding the exhausted [Actors]. But many were leaving. The Lamia—the &lt;em&gt;Lamia&lt;/em&gt; was smiling at Lyonette, keeping his distance from Lism and Alonna as Krshia shook his hand and left the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sour notes amid the good. But Erin had given a flower away to an [Alchemist] who told her he could experiment—it just might take a lot of flowers. And she saw Lyonette counting a pile of silver from the magical door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Good and bad. And perhaps it was because Erin was in a decent mood that the world decided to give her one last kick in the pants. Or again, it could be it was just chance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin. Excuse me, Erin, we have a problem."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ishkr walked over to Erin. The [Innkeeper] groaned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is it, Ishkr?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some of our guests…can't pay for their meal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll grimaced. Erin did too. That happened now and then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How much did they buy?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ishkr named the number. Erin fell out of her chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;How?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drinks. Ice cream. Pizzas. Blue fruit juice, chocolate—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ishkr rattled off the most expensive items on the menu. Especially the ice cream and chocolate. Erin saw Lyonette's head turning with wrath and ruination. Both she and Lyonette marched over to the arguing group of seven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought we had &lt;em&gt;enough!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We did! Why does it cost &lt;em&gt;gold?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because no one checked the prices! I—oh—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette propped her hands on her hips, looking at the group of young people. Erin blinked. There was something…familiar about them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Call the Watch, Erin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] looked annoyed. Rose raised her hands hurriedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone call for the Watch? I can hit a few people before I get to bed!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Relc was in a fine mood. He had autographs from the Players, and he was beaming after seeing the new play. He raised a jovial fist. The Earthers stared at him. Kevin laughed incredulously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked around. But Joseph and Rose had seen Erin. They were staring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin, it's us. Rose. Remember? Uh—we know each other?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time Lyonette and Ishkr both rolled their eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's the oldest trick in the book. Relc? Just hit them a few times and drag them off to the jail, please—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, wait! Erin! It's &lt;em&gt;us!&lt;/em&gt; From Magnolia's mansion!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph shouted as Relc walked over with fist raised. Erin blinked. And she remembered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Joseph? Rose? &lt;/em&gt;Wait—I think I remember—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She closed her eyes. She heard a &lt;em&gt;thud&lt;/em&gt; a shout, panic—Erin opened her eyes. Relc was standing over Joseph. The young man was on the floor. Erin held up a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait! Relc! They're—they're from &lt;em&gt;Ryoka! &lt;/em&gt;That's who she meant!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned, eyes wide, to Lyonette. The [Princess] stared at the Earthers. They were ducking away from Relc. The Drake paused, ready to kick Imani as she flinched and covered her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait, do I hit them or not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin looked at the group of seven. They stared at her. Rose tried to smile. Erin looked at their table stacked with dirty dishes. She thought about Ryoka's letter. Magnolia's brief aside. And she groaned and ground her teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette looked at Erin's face. The [Princess] closed her eyes. And she realized, as Montressa and Beza groaned and Palt made the same, sudden connection and came galloping across the inn's floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going to &lt;em&gt;kill &lt;/em&gt;Ryoka."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha solemnly nodded. She looked at the downed Joseph. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; was what Ryoka had sent? The Gnoll child wrinkled her nose. Then she sneezed on Joseph and went upstairs to sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin looked at the others people from Earth. And then, to everyone's surprise she laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. Nice to meet you all again. Welcome to The Wandering Inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached down and pulled Joseph up. He blinked at her. And Erin might be exasperated, confused, annoyed, but she looked at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're all from the same home. It's good to see you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Imani burst into tears. Erin reached out and took her hand. And her friends sighed. Or smiled. Relc lowered his fist and patted it sadly. But they were here at last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was an eventful night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">494285</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 02:05:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - 7.20</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/492530</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the darkness, there was fire. And fire, that elusive, dangerous thing, was brightest as night fell around Invrisil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a horrible thing. It could burn the land to ash. But it was also essential. And it was at its most beautiful when the shadows closed in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fire. A contradictory thing. It blazed in a young woman. If you looked at her and saw, you could witness it. An old flame, emitting one last surge of radiance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For the [Lady] remembered. And fire was like memory. They had called her Lady Firestarter, once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She watched as another spark of fire blossomed. This was mundane light. But no less welcoming for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Outside the gates of Invrisil, an adventurer was starting a fire. A woman wearing somewhat battered plate armor, well-maintained, but clearly damaged from fighting, was attending to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There wasn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much tinder to be found lying around Invrisil. It wasn't as if she could jog towards the nearest forest miles distant and find the waiting sticks and logs of wood pre-chopped on the ground. And trees didn't actually like to burn &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So she'd had to improvise. She had pried off sections of the rickety wagon the adventurers had been riding in. The guardrails, taken her sword to the back of the wagon—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were burning their ride. But they'd come to their destination, so the wagon was so much scrap. It was, in fact, a very practical action. And Yvlon Byres only despaired that other people weren't capable of thinking on their feet. And that number included her team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do you &lt;em&gt;mean,&lt;/em&gt; the city's closed? The gates never close!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Trader] was wailing at the [Guards] on the gate. One of them shouted down as the others ignored the plaintive voice. A crowd was milling around the shut gates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mayor's orders, sir!&lt;/em&gt; The city was attacked less than a week ago! There's a travel restriction—whomever sent yonder giant at our walls is still out there!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed. Every head turned to the decomposing flesh giant in the distance. It was being burned. But flesh liked to burn even less than wood, and the thing was &lt;em&gt;massive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Trader] paled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But what are we to do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Find an inn. Come back in the morning."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] was unhelpful. The crowd milled about. Yvlon watched, sighing as she fed the small blaze she'd created with some flint and tinder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What a mess. Invrisil almost &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; gets attacked. Let alone closes the gates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She remarked to no one in particular. Her teammates had wandered off the instant they realized they weren't getting into the city that night. They might still be milling around the gates. But the [Silversteel Armsmistress] had immediately taken stock of the situation. She'd moved the wagon off the road, set up a small camp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was an adventurer. And unlike the distressed [Trader] who was terrified of having to camp with his valuables outside, Yvlon was already planning out a night in the open. It wasn't hard; they didn't have a tent, but they could sleep in the wagon or under it if it rained. She wished they'd kept the outdoor tents adventurers brought, but they had blankets aplenty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd started the fire, checked their supplies. Another mistake; they had little more than dry rations, but with some water from a well somewhere, they'd make do. A bit of hunger never killed anyone. Well—a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Yvlon would dig a latrine. Maybe Ksmvr could help with that; he was Antinium. The [Armsmistress] glanced about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where are they? I swear, if Pisces gets caught trying to go over the walls…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grumbled under her breath. Her team. She loved them. But they were a disaster of a group in some respects. She still remembered the eggs incident. Food poisoning! For nearly two days she'd had to herd her teammates around. And they could get into other trouble as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr, at least, had the excuse that he was three. Ceria and Pisces on the other hand? &lt;em&gt;[Mages].&lt;/em&gt; And while Ceria wasn't as arrogant or inclined to causing mischief as Pisces, she could be just as crazy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon's old team hadn't been that bad. They'd had characters, but—actually, no. Compared to the Horns, they'd been as interesting as dirt. Yvlon had never walked in on one of the Silver Spears rolling around in a pile of treasure. That had happened twice with her teammates. First Pisces and Ksmvr, and then Ceria who'd heard about it and wanted to try it out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's see. Fire's good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Armsmistress] critically examined the fire. She added some more wood, fearlessly inserting her hand &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the fire. Because her hands and arms up to her shoulder weren't flesh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were a strange metal, a mix of silver and steel, hence her class. And the metal imitated her arms perfectly. Down to the curvature of her muscle; they even flexed and tendons rippled as she adjusted the fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Metal like flesh. Or rather, metal that had replaced her flesh. Yvlon could even feel the heat; she felt &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how hot it was. But the sensation was removed from the burning she would have experienced normally. It was passing strange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet, here were her arms. And they were far better than the crippled mess she had been resigned to a month ago. Yvlon inspected her hands as she took them out of the fire. She touched her leg and burned herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ow.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her arms kept the heat of the fire. Yvlon stared at them, slightly exasperated, slightly…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd had time to get used to them. But how much time was enough? These were her arms. And they were beautiful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And foreign. They were lovely art. People stared at them when they met Yvlon, even more than her features, which had always been the case beforehand. They told her how beautiful she looked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she was Yvlon, not art. She would have admired her arms too. But they were &lt;em&gt;hers.&lt;/em&gt; And that changed everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nevertheless—she had her team. That was what mattered. Grumbling and looking around for them now, Yvlon made sure the fire wouldn't spread and then dusted her hands. She looked about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The smart visitors to Invrisil, the City of Adventurers, were on the move. [Farmers] were taking their goods back, bemoaning the lost time, but with homes to visit. Or—they were heading back down the road to find lodging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some were milling about. Unable to cope with events so dramatic and profoundly troubling to their way of life as being locked out of a city for a night. They'd make poor adventurers. Yvlon had some sympathy for them, but it had limits. They were all adults. They had to take care of themselves; if they couldn't handle this, how could they even &lt;em&gt;live &lt;/em&gt;in this world where monsters might attack out of nowhere?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The uncharitable thought gave Yvlon some pause. Of course, it was the Byres way to give aid to anyone in need. Her brother would, at this very moment, be organizing everyone, making sure no one went hungry. He was like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she wasn't. Yvlon sighed as she watched a family milling about. Well—maybe they could share their rations. Such as they were. Just a few mouthfuls of some seeds Ceria had bought to snack on, some flatbread, two days old…where could she find food?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And where is my &lt;em&gt;team?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gold-rank adventurer complained. She looked around and spotted a young woman tethering her horse to a rock. She was well-dressed, in a somewhat ill-fitting noblewoman's garments. But they were expensive and Yvlon imagined the young woman—around her age—was a [Lady] of some sort. At least of the landed gentry. But she seemed industrious. Industrious and inexperienced, that was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd started a fire. A brilliant flame on the ground. But—Yvlon frowned. There was no firewood. Some Skill? The young woman had left her horse some grazing room and tied it securely, but now she was rummaging around. And she clearly had nothing to eat or anywhere to stay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A traveller for a day. Yvlon shook her head. Now, Ylawes, or her father, Yitton Byres would be trying to figure out how to feed everyone. Ylawes would raise his voice, stride into the road, and tell everyone he'd watch out for them. Yvlon didn't have that kind of courage. Her older sister did, and Ylawes—but of different sorts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hah—Ysara would be selling them food. And Ylawes…did Pisces go looking for a way into the city? We have to bring the &lt;em&gt;door&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the objects in the wagon was a wooden door, inset with a magical stone. It should have been the first candidate for burning, rather than the wagon, which could be sold. But Yvlon hadn't touched it. Because it was a magical door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were nearly at Invrisil. So nearly. But one last hurdle eluded them, after a long while of small adventures. Fighting off natural stone golems, experiencing food poisoning—hostility against Ksmvr as a member of the Antinium—Yvlon sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If only we could hop through the door. But—no, that would never work. It wouldn't be able to take us all, anyways. Just two of us at best, right? Still—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She rolled her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pisces would demand to be first. And Ceria. So Ksmvr and I get to guard the wagon. I suppose that's better than listening to Pisces grumble all night. Hm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached for the door. In the darkness, other people were setting up camp outside the walls. Yvlon coughed as some of the foul odor of the burning flesh giant in the distance wafted to her. She reached for the door's handle—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wouldn't do that, Yvlon. The door won't activate. And even if it does, I think we're good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A female voice. Yvlon Byres' head turned. She saw a half-Elf, her hair shining by firelight. The [Cryomancer] smiled as Yvlon straightened. And she was different too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria's eyes were pale. And the air was colder around her. Just a bit. If she lost control, it turned to ice, and it might even snow in her presence. One of her hands was skeletal. And the [Ice Mage]'s magical powers in her element had grown even stronger of late. She was also carrying something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? I thought you'd want to try the door, Ceria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon gestured at the door. She saw the young noblewoman looking around and cursing, clearly unsure of how to find food at this hour. Ceria grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What, me? I can sleep outdoors one day. And I doubt Erin's attuned &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; door to ours. It won't open if she doesn't set the stone, remember? We'll have to [Message] her. You can try it, but I think we're stuck for the night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Right."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon lamely opened the door. And of course, nothing happened. She sighed. There went one of her food options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where did Pisces and Ksmvr go?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have no idea. But I've got water."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Armsmistress] looked up. Ceria held up something. Her bag of holding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I went to find some. First things first, we need water, right? I don't know how much food we have, but conjuring water is a pain. Magical ice you can't eat, so…here. Enough to fill the pot a few times."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She held out the bag of holding. Yvlon blinked. She peered inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did you pour the water inside? It'll get—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I took everything else out first. I'm not an idiot, Yvlon. Shame we don't have a bag of holding with multiple pocket-spaces. Anyways, it's simpler to find a river, like I did than to keep conjuring water. I'm a [Cryomancer] after all; I sensed it. Did you make that fire? Nice!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria sat down with a smile and began to warm herself. Although it was mostly for pleasure; she felt little cold anymore. Yvlon blinked at her friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria Springwalker, Captain of the Horns of Hammerad. She was a good leader in a fight and the most easygoing of all of them, but Yvlon had never really thought she was this resourceful. But she forgot—Ceria had lived in a forest growing up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, did you see Pisces and Ksmvr?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. But I'm sure they're just scoping out things."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon doubted that. But—her uncharitable thoughts about her team's expertise in a survival environment were shattered yet again. Because out of the darkness emerged a glowing [Light] spell. And there was a young Human man, dressed in white robes, a rapier at his side, and an Antinium Worker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At her fire, the young [Lady] raised her head warily as the two approached. But Pisces, for all his newfound power, looked like…Pisces. And until he sniffed or sneered or conjured an undead creation, he was actually fairly handsome. As for Ksmvr—he was a Worker. And they were both carrying armfuls of—food?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yes, food. Pisces put an armful of potatoes on the wagon's back—enough to feed everyone dinner and then some. Ksmvr had a jug of milk, a half-wheel of cheese, and a small jar filled with strong-smelling spices among a few other sundry ingredients. Pisces pulled a few more items out of his pockets, some onion, a bit of wrapped butter, as Yvlon stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where have you two been? I thought you were looking for a route over the walls! And where did you get that food? Don't tell me you—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces glanced up at Yvlon. He shook his head, mystified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We stole nothing, Yvlon. Rather, I was securing our dinner. Ksmvr helped me carry the lot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have also found some natural growing rhubarb and an herb I believe is known as basil out of the ground, Miss Yvlon. I had also dug up a number of nutritional worms, but Comrade Pisces believed they were unnecessary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium watched as Pisces fished around in the team's belongings. He had a bag of holding too and he came over to the fire with a pot, cast-iron kettle, and nodded at Ksmvr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr, peel those potatoes. We can cook the food in here. Where's the butter…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here. What are you making?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. I have no idea. Cheese and potatoes were all we could get. I intercepted some of the [Farmers] and this was cheapest. Brown the potatoes with the butter, add in a bit of the milk and cheese?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mhm. Any meat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"None."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. I'll live. Ksmvr, how tasty were the bugs you found?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mostly worms, Captain Ceria. I can retrieve them if you'd like."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Nah. Nah, I'm good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon watched in a minor state of shock as the rest of her teammates gathered around the fire. Ksmvr peeled potatoes with all three hands as Ceria levitated a few ingredients to Pisces. He was gently heating the cast-iron pan and cooking the first of the potato slices in the butter before she came to her senses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;You could know someone, and not &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; someone. Her teammates had changed so much since she'd met them, but still—Pisces sat by the fire. And he grumbled about the weight of the cast-iron pot, and began to levitate it instead of holding it. And he was browning the potatoes as he made an impromptu meal of cheesy potatoes. Ceria was making some tea in a kettle, and Ksmvr had found more wild plants to add to the meal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon had assumed prior to this moment that if they were ever dropped without her in the middle of a forest, her team would starve—or Ceria and Ksmvr would eat Pisces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I had no idea you could cook, Pisces."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Necromancer] sniffed. That was somehow reassuring to Yvlon; he hadn't been replaced by some phantom taking his body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I seldom do. I find cooking quite inconvenient and time-consuming since I have few Skills. But it behooves one to know a few tricks of the trade. Cast-iron is a wonderful retainer of heat, incidentally. Ksmvr, some salt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here, Comrade Pisces."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you found the rhubarb and other plants, Ksmvr?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium that had been adopted by the Horns of Hammerad, whom Yvlon thought of like a younger brother sometimes, the one she had never known she wanted—smiled brightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Yvlon. I have studied many edible plants as part of my training to become a Prognugator. And Comrade Pisces is a good cook. He has cooked many times, with things he has purloined. Or so he informs me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces coughed hurriedly and turned his head. Yvlon narrowed her eyes, but Ceria was inspecting the tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's sort of weak, but it'll do. We're sleeping in the wagon tonight, everyone. I was just telling Yvlon I doubt the magic door to Erin's inn is open."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could send a [Message]. I have the spell now. To that…Palt? Or Montressa?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces commented neutrally. Ceria chewed on her lip. She glanced at the wagon, part of which had been cannibalized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nah, this isn't bad. Besides…I want us to be in Invrisil before we see Erin, you know? Hey, who destroyed part of our wagon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon turned red. She looked at the fire, which she'd made. The food, water, everything else? Her team. She'd been about to suggest they all have a handful of seeds and dry flatbread and call it a night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I uh—I did. Sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lowers the resale value."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces murmured with a frown. Ceria waved it off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Halfseekers bought the wagon, Pisces. It's fine. Nice fire. Say—it's getting a bit cold, isn't it? Windy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Indeed, a wind was beginning to whip around Invrisil. Yvlon didn't feel it on her arms, but her face objected to the sudden chill. She heard a curse—the young [Lady]'s fire had gone out. Another mark of inexperience; you couldn't make most Skill-based creations last more than an hour. She needed actual firewood to keep the fire going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces frowned as he adjusted the pan. He was putting in shredded cheese and a bit of milk and watching his potato slices marinate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Inconvenient. Oh glorious captain, can you deal with that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria rolled her eyes. Yvlon got up quickly; she'd unhitched the horses and tethered them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can help push the wagon against the wind—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nah. My [Ice Walls] should do. They'll last a few hours. I'll recast as we sleep and we won't notice once we're out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria drew her wand. The [Artic Cryomancer]'s pale eyes, like a winter's chill, flashed as she pointed. Yvlon saw walls of opaque ice rising out of the ground. On all four sides, the ice rose higher. And then made a slanted roof overhead. Critically, Ceria added a few windows. And the ice house was done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There. Shouldn't whistle with the winds in the background. And the campfire shouldn't melt it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon stared about the temporary dwelling. Ceria had even included the wagon inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Won't the ice drip over time? Even if the campfire doesn't melt it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Warrior] lamely looked at Ceria. The half-Elf shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magical ice. It'll just vanish if it does. Whoops! Good catch, Yvlon. Nearly forgot the chimney."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ice reshaped itself as Ceria pointed. Her mastery of her magic had improved; before she had only been able to conjure simple walls of ice. Ksmvr happily stared around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Very defensible, Captain Ceria. I will then take first watch. I see there are also spaces for cover that I might shoot our enemies through. I would expect nothing less."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces snorted as he checked on the potatoes. Ceria sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr, we don't need a guard. I mean—it makes sense. But we're not in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much danger here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium [Skirmisher] thought about this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, this would be part of our talks about 'paranoia' and 'not alarming people', yes, Captain Ceria? In that case, I will obey. And simply set up a few tripwires."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bustled out of the ice home's door. Yvlon saw the Antinium produce lengths of thin string. And he hung a few bells on them that would jangle if anyone tripped over them, tying the strings to stakes he hammered into the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the first things Ksmvr had bought with his share of the immediate profits from killing the Crelers and his adventures was more gear. He already had his personal bag of holding with a number of crossbows in it; Crossbow Stan's legacy. But he'd added bells, two bear traps, and any number of gadgets to his repertoire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And with that, their security for the night was taken care of. Yvlon would have wanted a watch, just in case. But between the ice house and Ksmvr's traps…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The daughter of house Byres looked around. More people had set up camp, but the Horns of Hammerad's camp was by far the most…luxurious. Ceria was laying out blankets in the wagon. Ksmvr was patting horses. Pisces pronounced his first bowl of potatoes done and the smell was making Yvlon's mouth water. She decided to pour everyone some tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks for the fire, Yvlon. Really helped to come back to it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria smiled at the [Armsmistress]. Pisces handed a bowl of food over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, thanks are in order."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded. Ksmvr bowed his head slightly. Yvlon—waved her hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…It was nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Humbling, surprising, but gratifying. The Horns of Hammerad sat about the fire and Yvlon realized—this was why she liked her team. They, including her, were a band of idiots. But they were &lt;em&gt;united&lt;/em&gt; idiots. Teammates. She was laughing as Pisces began to complain about the flesh giant's smell—muted by Ceria's ice walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not saying I approve of the methods. I am just &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; that it was inefficiently made! Solid flesh? You can make a framework and—no, I'm not endorsing killing that many people, Ceria! I'm just saying that if I were doing it—&lt;em&gt;hypothetically&lt;/em&gt;—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dingaling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sound of a few bells ringing made the Horns of Hammerad look up. The adventurers immediately stood. From outside their fort, they heard a muffled curse. And then a voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me! I'm unarmed! I just came to ask if you'd be willing to share some food? I can pay!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The adventurers looked at each other. Ceria relaxed. Pisces—vanished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The invisible [Necromancer] brushed against Yvlon and she glanced over his shoulder. He was at a window. Paranoia? Or sense? Ceria called out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come on over, by all means!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stood. And that was when Yvlon saw the young woman she'd observed earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady]'s dress was mussed from travel. And her hair was in disarray. More than that—she looked a bit saddle sore. Yvlon hadn't seen a saddle on her horse. The young woman was wearing slippers, not riding boots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her clothing didn't &lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt;, Yvlon realized. And that made her suspect a [Thief]. But who wore what they stole? And for all that, she belonged in the clothes. She had a presence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her hair was jet black, mixed with fiery red and orange. Like embers in the smoke. Long gleaming hair, a strong profile—oh yes. Yvlon recognized the blood of a noble house at once. Many mothers had childbearing or bloodline Skills. Some fathers, come to that. The nobility and even royalty bred their offspring to be the best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the young woman was perfectly respectful. She bowed slightly, smiling with a touch of wariness as she held up a string with bells attached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I broke it, I'm sorry. I—hope I'm not intruding? I was wondering if I could—share the pot? I can pay, but I was locked out of the city with everyone else. And I don't have supplies for the night…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her words were also a bit odd. Not as if she had a lisp, but rather the tone and wording themselves. She switched from authoritative to polite halfway through. Yvlon got the impression the young woman's preference would have been to demand the adventurer's food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All heads turned to Ceria. The [Ice Mage] blinked, but she only had to look at Yvlon for a second before she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. Don't worry about the money. We're all stuck. I've never heard of Invrisil being closed. Come on in—we've got more than enough food. Come to that, I wonder if anyone else is hungry? I thought I saw some families."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Yvlon. And that was why she liked Ceria. The [Armsmistress] half-rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I saw a few families. I can check."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman was hesitating at the opening to the ice house. She looked at Ksmvr and then pretended not to be. Ceria smiled and waved her over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come in, have a seat. Don't mind Ksmvr. He's…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Antinium."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman murmured. She walked forwards. Not afraid, but wary of Ksmvr. She studied him as Ksmvr raised two hands on his left side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello, I am Ksmvr. I am not a monster. Also, I do not eat people. I am an adventurer and perfectly safe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He'd been working on that introduction. It hadn't ever quite worked beforehand, but the young woman nodded tightly. She sat on the other end of the fire as Ceria checked the pot. Yvlon was heading for the door when a figure bustled in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've just done a quick circuit of the other fires. It looks like most people are well attended to—oh, hello. Who is this, then? A guest? Many people are sharing fires."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces smiled innocuously at the young lady. Maviola glanced at Pisces, and smiled in a friendly way as Yvlon stared at Pisces. He gave her a nod and stepped back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, I didn't know where to go. I was about to ride back, but I was afraid my horse would stumble in the darkness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola didn't seem surprised to see him. Nor had she blinked at his sudden entrance as the rest of Pisces' team had. The [Necromancer]'s [Invisibility] spell…hadn't worked on Maviola El.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But no one noticed that. Ceria sighed as she stared at the browned cheesy potatoes, bubbling hot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dinner's ready! Don't worry about paying. Miss…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maviola. And thank you. Are you sure you wouldn't accept—?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf impatiently waved off the offer as she ladled the piping hot food into bowls and passed them around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We've got money. We're adventurers, actually. The Horns of Hammerad. Any idea why Invrisil is closed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola accepted a bowl, murmuring thanks. She shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I heard there was a failed attack. That Flesh Giant. No casualties in the attack, but an entire village was…killed to make it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns looked shocked. Pisces just counted as he moved his lips silently. &lt;em&gt;You could make three&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;if—&lt;/em&gt;Yvlon punched his shoulder and he winced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We had no idea. Where did it come from?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A [Necromancer], or so they say."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola's face was guileless. She was dissembling, but she couldn't have known how that comment would make the Horns wince.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not good. [Necromancers], huh? Sounds like whoever killed those people was a monster. Right, Pisces? I wonder who might have done that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Necromancer] burned his tongue on his food, but it really was delicious for such a simple meal. He put more potatoes into the pot to be seared as he thought out loud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't think of any cult or group with the power to make a &lt;em&gt;giant&lt;/em&gt; undead like that. It must have been a Level…40 [Necromancer]. Surely."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola's head turned. She saw a chitinous hand waving at her and instantly recoiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Would you like some salt, Miss Maviola?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium was politely offering some salt in a packet to Maviola. The [Lady] hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—very well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Gingerly, she accepted the salt packet, taking care not to touch Ksmvr's hands. And she looked at him. The Antinium was smiling, forgetting that most people had no idea of how to read his face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other adventurers noticed. Yvlon chewed, swallowed, and then spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Maviola. Are you part of the noble houses of Izril, by any chance? Perhaps related to the House of El? Their matriarch is named Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] blinked. She looked up—and again, she was very good at hiding her feelings. Her eyes flickered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Slightly, yes. I was named after Maviola El. And I'm a distant relation. Not that noble, but my family thought it was a good way of currying favor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wariness.&lt;/em&gt; Yvlon instantly tried to clarify.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see. I just ask because I'm Yvlon Byres. Third Daughter of the House of Byres. I know a lot of the family names."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Instantly, Maviola relaxed. Her expression cleared and a smile flitted across her features at last. She seemed to notice Yvlon's arms again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"House Byres? That's an honorable lot. What is a daughter of the Byres family doing here? I know of a Ylawes Byres, a Gold-rank adventurer. Would you be…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"His younger sister. Gold-rank as well, actually. We were just promoted."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman blinked. She chewed on the burning-hot potatoes. Even Ceria, who would eat bugs, and Pisces, who would eat hot dishes, had to wait. Yvlon too. Only Ksmvr and Maviola seemed immune to the sheer heat of the food. The [Lady] looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Forgive me, but I didn't know I was bothering a team of Gold-rank adventurers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Forgive what? We're not that big. And we &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; got promoted. I'm sorry, we haven't introduced ourselves, have we? The Horns of Hammerad, adventurers from down around Celum. I'm Ceria Springwalker, the Captain. [Cryomancer]. Don't mind the hand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf waved her skeletal hand. Maviola blinked at it. Pisces bowed slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Maviola, I am Pisces, a [Mage] from Wistram at your service."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yvlon Byres, [Armsmistress]. My arms are recent too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon stared at Pisces. Ksmvr raised one of his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Ksmvr, formerly of the Free Antinium. But I was kicked out. I am a [Skirmisher] and the least-able member of my team. Hello!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young [Lady] was blinking at the introductions. Skeletal hand, silversteel arms—Ksmvr. She looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Maviola Imarris. Distantly related to the House of El and the Imarris family, but an offshoot branch. Not really of the high nobility, but I am a [Lady]. Thank you for gracing me with dinner."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all. Heck of a thing, isn't it? Invrisil being closed. Even if there was an attack, I can't remember it ever happening in the years I've been in Izril."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's happened three times in recent memory. But it is rare."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola murmured. She was eating with a passion. Her eyes lit up as she savored each bite while trying to scarf at the same time. It was rather reminiscent of Ksmvr, actually. The sheer joy she had for the food made Yvlon envious, and she &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; the meal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is amazing food. Thank you so much for sharing it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not that excellent. But I have to admit, there is some pleasure in cooking a meal well. By all means, have seconds."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces puffed up slightly and he tended to the second serving. And there were certainly a lot of mouths to feed. Yvlon was a [Warrior] and hungry—and the rest of her team was just gluttonous by nature. Maviola no less than the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"May I ask, what brings an Antinium out of their Hives? I don't…know the Antinium nearly as well as I thought I did. I thought they never left their Hives. Much less became adventurers. Or…spoke. Except for their leaders."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola had to breach the question at last. Yvlon was impressed by her restraint, but she was still clearly wary for all she was relaxing. It was Ceria who replied with a smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr's a bit—different. He was kicked out of his Hive. And he was an uh, Prognugator. That's one of their leaders. But he's alright. Don't mind him if he makes any mistakes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am learning. And I was a disgrace to my Hive so I was exiled. Hello! Again!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr waved at Maviola. She blinked, and her eye sharpened with interest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really? &lt;/em&gt;May I ask—if it's not too impolite? What brought an Antinium into a team? Are there more like that? And—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She glanced at Yvlon and Ceria. The [Armsmistress] smiled crookedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry, everyone wants to know. And it is a story."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Horns chuckled. By now, the tale of their slaying of the Adult Creler wasn't something that filled them with an abundance of embarrassment and pride. But—it still felt good to tell. Yvlon told it as quickly as she could, with Ceria helping and Pisces adding anecdotes as he stirred the potatoes. Maviola listened. And her eyes lit up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You killed an Adult Creler as Silver-ranks?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not alone. We lost a lot of good adventurers. We got lucky. It was Yvlon who kept bashing it in the head."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was all luck, Miss Maviola. But we've had a lot of it. We paid for it, though…Ceria's hand, my arms."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even so. Adventurers. I dreamed of being one as a girl."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola looked at them, eyes shining by firelight. Somehow, the fire wasn't dying down. Yvlon hadn't needed to add to it for over an hour. Ever since Maviola had arrived. And—the young woman had an aura about her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not just a presence, an &lt;em&gt;aura.&lt;/em&gt; Yvlon recognized it. It wasn't hostile, though. But when the young [Lady] leaned over, you felt like she was looking only at you. It made you want to tell her everything. It was also, vaguely…familiar. Different, but familiar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not all glory and treasure. Being an adventurer is sometimes wading through muck. Or getting hurt. But it is—something. Not that I'm saying you should dive into it, but you could get into adventuring, Miss Maviola. Sorry—is it [Lady]? You're young enough."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman laughed ruefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If only. I'm not the best for fighting. And I think I'd better leave such things to you. I'm just envious from afar. Once again, thank you for hosting me. I haven't had a meal like this in…dec—years."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You don't really need to thank us. It's just a little bit of food."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the [Lady]'s smile was infectious. And Yvlon, sitting in the ice fort, listened as Maviola had to ask what had led to Ceria's skeletal hand. Her ice magic—the conversation turned lively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And outside of Invrisil's walls, the people were sitting around campfires. Even if not protected from the wind, they huddled together. Taking something from the communal experience. Strangers, moving closer in the darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And enterprise was a thing of beauty. It could fit anywhere. As Ceria was explaining about Skinner and Maviola was gripping her bowl, Pisces looked up from his second round of potatoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Wine! Half-price if you'll throw in part of your pot! Silver a cup; twelve a bottle! And that's a bargain!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Trader] was shouting as she went down the lines of campfires. Pisces' head rose. So did Maviola's. She reached for her purse, but Ceria was faster than both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr, secure that wine!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Skirmisher] shot to his feet. He rushed out the door, like a shot. Maviola jerked as the [Skirmisher] moved with all the Skills afforded to him and a Prognugator's reflexes. He was as fast as a horse for a second. Yvlon heard his voice from outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Excuse me! I would like to purchase—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A scream. The [Trader] saw a huge bug-person coming at her in the night. Yvlon jumped to her feet, sighing. Ceria looked shamefaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It took Yvlon a minute to calm the [Trader] and get her coin. When she came back, it was with three wine flasks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oho! That is generous for you, Yvlon!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces rubbed his hands together, beaming. Yvlon gave him a look, although it was true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have a guest, Pisces. It's not the best, Lady Maviola—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman's eyes were locked so hard on the wine flasks that Yvlon thought she was a [Drunkard]. But her first sip of the wine made her &lt;em&gt;sigh.&lt;/em&gt; And her eyes watered with emotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I haven't had a good cup—tasted it in—eight years?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Eight&lt;em&gt; years?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola jumped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—I had poor taste buds. I um—had a sickness. And restrictive family members. [Healers]. I'm free to drink now, though. And allow me to pay for my share."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's no—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I insist. Here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola dug out some silver coins and handed them to Ceria. The half-Elf accepted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you. And let's all have a drink. To burning Flesh Giants outside of Invrisil and good potatoes!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone laughed. The wine began to flow as Maviola settled back. She sipped liberally, and Yvlon found the drink was a welcome comfort in the cold; Ceria's ice walls kept out the wind, but they themselves had a chill. And soon—the Horns of Hammerad were back to their usual mood, plus one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay—hear me out. This is a hypothetical scenario."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria was smiling as she waved at the others over a third helping. Yvlon sat back, groaning and adjusting her armor as she lifted the wineskin. She squeezed a bit too hard and splashed far too much wine into her cup. She didn't know her strength, sometimes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—here we have some uh, cute, fluffy—uh—uh—things. Like bunnies, except they have two legs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sounds horrifying."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon laughed. Ceria waved at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shh! Listen! Here's the thing. The bunny-things are &lt;em&gt;magical&lt;/em&gt;. They don't hurt anyone, and they go around eating grass and crap all day. And they're intelligent, and cute, and they've done nothing wrong. But if you &lt;em&gt;kill&lt;/em&gt; them, you level up. In any class. And you get…one level for each fifty you kill."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone stared at Ceria. Yvlon checked how much wine Ceria had had. It was fairly strong, but—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ceria!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay, twenty? Kill twenty per level, then. I'm just asking—&lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; you? If you could level up, but they were crying and begging when you killed them—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No! &lt;/em&gt;Not even one! Let alone fifty, or twenty!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon was disgusted. She raised a finger and then hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—I mean, they're sentient, right? And you can't level up &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Forever, let's say."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria spread her hands out, grinning. Yvlon had to think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But that's so &lt;em&gt;wrong. &lt;/em&gt;Even if they were just bunnies…."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait, is killing bunnies better?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon was trapped. Pisces slowly raised a hand and Ceria pointed at him. The [Necromancer] tapped his fingers together thoughtfully before speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Is this in an isolated place with no possibility of the consequences of my actions coming back to haunt me, or would this be a known fact? How morally acceptable would this practice be, culturally?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Pisces!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria was laughing. Yvlon raised a fist. Pisces edged back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's worth &lt;em&gt;levels&lt;/em&gt;, Yvlon! Morality aside, or even with morality—the benefits are—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have an opinion."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium made Maviola look up slightly from her cup. She regarded him with the slightest haze of wariness. But Ksmvr spoke brightly, looking innocently from face to face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I would divide the totality of these creatures up into segments of fifty, or twenty and kill one fourth of them to thus split the potential level growth, Captain Ceria. Or perhaps it would be most efficient for one of us to kill &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these creatures to achieve the highest level in one person? I can see why this question is so difficult."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone looked at Ksmvr. Yvlon put her head in her hands. And Maviola El began to laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was an old laugh, at first something like a cackle. And then—it became younger. She began to chuckle, giggle. Hiccup. The laughter turned into hiccups as everyone laughed. And the [Lady] kept laughing. She had tears in her eyes, but she forced herself to speak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"May I share my opinion?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon looked exasperated at the ethical dilemmas Ceria and Pisces loved to argue over. Maviola quieted. And then she nodded authoritatively at Ksmvr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a nice idea—Ksmvr? However, flawed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She took a deep drink from her wine, tossing her head back. And her hair caught the light. Yvlon saw Maviola smiling. And in that moment, Yvlon was envious of that young [Lady]. Because here was a beauty people would talk about. As much as Lady Dealia. Maviola must have been from an obscure family if she wasn't famed for her looks. The [Lady] smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Regarding these creature—if you wanted to maximize their worth, you'd breed them and keep leveling…forever. Then sell them to people. No, wait. You'd allow them to open up your own businesses. They'd have to slaughter on-site and you'd have to make sure no one walked off with one. That's a mistake I'd make."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The adventurers stared at Maviola. Yvlon's jaw dropped. Ksmvr was nodding. So was Pisces. Yvlon looked at Ceria—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then they all began laughing. Yvlon found herself holding her side and wheezing because it &lt;em&gt;wasn't&lt;/em&gt; funny. But they had drinks, food, company. And this was her team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces was cooking the last of the food, Ceria was splashing wine into the pot to 'give it taste' as he flung spices at her, furiously, and Ksmvr was speaking to Maviola. She caught herself, looked at him. And an expression of strange curiosity flickered across her face. Wariness, reserve, hostility—but she looked at Ksmvr again. And smiled, spoke. Answered his question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Who was she? Yvlon didn't know. Not Maviola's deepest secrets, or why she had ridden towards Invrisil with naught but an ill-fitting noblewoman's dress and slippers, for all she had money. Or why the fire blazed around her and the young woman made the air feel alive. Made each moment feel worth living.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she didn't have to know. You could fail to be friends with someone after knowing them for years. Or find a fast connection in a night. And that night, Maviola El sat and ate and talked and drank with the Horns of Hammerad, a chance meeting, long into the night. She slept in the house of ice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she felt more alive than she had in a long time. The cooking fire blazed all the way into dawn as she slept. Smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An ordinary night, to follow an ordinary day. No monsters attacked The Wandering Inn. No armies marched on Liscor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was a good sign. It was going to be uneventful today. Erin could feel it. And that was okay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she didn't know. The young woman was surprisingly ignorant of many things. Perhaps—it was willful. Perhaps ignorance &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; bliss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Morning, Mrsha. How're you doing today? Where's Lyonette?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The white Gnoll cub was sitting at a table when Erin came down. Arms folded. Scowling. Erin blinked at the uncharacteristic look on Mrsha's face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is Lyonette asleep?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nope.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Two shakes of the head. Erin frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—maybe she's getting our new guests ready. Right—we need breakfast for everyone! Good thing we have the preservation stuff, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She closed her eyes, thoughtfully. Yes, Temile and some of the [Actors] were in their rooms. Palt was too, and Montressa. Beza was—in the outhouse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin could &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; their presences. It was part of her new power as an [Innkeeper]. Perhaps—[Crowd Control]? [Inn's Aura]? Or was this just her class? She couldn't tell what they were doing, just their general area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. Looks like…oh, good. Our Antinium guests are still asleep. And Lyonette is with Pawn. I bet she's teaching him dancing and stuff. They're pals. Isn't that great?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled at Mrsha. The Gnoll gave her a &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;. But she said nothing. And Erin didn't pick up on the look. She just assumed Mrsha was jealous, which was a conclusion perpendicular to the truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Willful ignorance or not? Erin Solstice got ready. By the time her guests came down and Lyonette hurried out to help, the food was ready.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And—the inn had guests. Erin stared at her magic door, tilting her head sideways from left to right. Lyonette frowned as she looked at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're doing it again, Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Staring at the door. What's wrong? You keep doing it, every few days."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I do? I guess I do. It feels—different today. Huh. Say—do you have a fever? You're sweaty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette jumped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me? No. I just did some sword training this morning. Let's get to work, Erin. Liscor—hello, Drassi! Welcome, guests."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, okay. But stay healthy! That's important because you can't get sick in an inn. I mean, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, but it's not good. Hi, Drassi! Menolit. And there's little Visma!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello. I came to have breakfast."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Visma stared solemnly up at Erin with her brother holding her claw. Erin smiled at Feiss. He ducked his head shyly as the other guests came through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi, Feiss! We have breakfast! Come in!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah—my mother wanted to give you the coin for last time. Visma ate the ice cream, Miss Solstice…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young Drake, blushing, shyly offered Erin some coins. She waved it away, laughing, and slapped him on the shoulder. &lt;em&gt;He &lt;/em&gt;jumped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry about it! Visma's Mrsha's friend. And a friend of a friend is…uh, it's on the house!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded at Lyonette and the [Princess] nodded back. Anything for Mrsha's little friends. The older brother watched his sister run into the inn, shouting for Mrsha. He nodded to Erin, blushing still, and hurried after her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Esthelm. &lt;em&gt;Hello! &lt;/em&gt;Anyone for Liscor? Come on through! One moment please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin waved at the Humans waiting in line. A few she knew; the others bowed to her, having heard of her by reputation. Erin adjusted the door as Lyonette let her take over. She moved the dial to the third setting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyone for Wailant's—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A gaggle of Humans stared at Erin. She stared back. Citizens of Celum, [Farmers], and more were waiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is this &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; inn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Told you. Pay up. I mean, pay me later. Morning, Miss Solstice! Just spreading the word about your inn to other folk. Good business, I imagine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate], Wailant, winked at Erin. She gave him a look. But she had to welcome people through. And whatever Wailant's finder fee was—she wasn't in the mood to catch him today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, is Numbtongue here? Thought I might stop by."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Garia was at the end of the pack. The fit City Runner looked like she'd dropped another few pounds. Erin blinked at her. This was more than just weight loss. She even looked more…lithe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—yeah. He's having breakfast. Come on in, Garia! You're looking good!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. Thanks, Erin!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman closed the door as Garia came through. Wailant sighed, and walked off. And then—Erin stared at the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Curious and curiouser."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The feeling hadn't disappeared. Erin felt like &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; was calling to her from the door. Her eyes moved to two unused stones on the door. She kept trying one, on a hunch. The red stone that had belonged to the Redfang Goblins and Cave Goblins. But the other one? Her hand reached for it—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then, Erin remembered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pallass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Almost perfunctorily, she switched it to Pallass and threw the door open. Then she'd try—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Muscles stared down at her. Erin looked at the green wall of scale and sinew in front of her and blinked. Then she looked up. Grimalkin was standing in the doorway, arms folded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Solstice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Grimalkin! Hey! You want to come through?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Among others."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sinew Magus] stepped through. And Erin saw—&lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; people waiting in line. She blinked. Octavia hurried forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry! I'm late for my meeting with Master Saliss! Thanks for breakfast, Erin—I took some food for—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halt! No entry without—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's on the list!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin shouted at Kel. Grimalkin waved a claw and the [Guardsman] checked his list. Erin stared at the two Drakes, a Dullahan, and two Gnolls and a Garuda. She recognized none of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; on the list?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They are."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kel informed Erin. She crossed her arms and smirked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How do I know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sergeant Kel's right eye began to twitch uncontrollably. The Drake [Sergeant] slowly turned his list towards her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you could have just written that down. How do I know—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't have time for this. Miss Solstice, kindly stop harassing Pallass' City Watch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin sighed. Erin looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, fine. Come on through! Anyone want to go to Liscor? Anyone for the Strongheart Farm? They've got good eggs! Esthelm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me! Me, please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the two Drakes pushed forwards. It was—Emessa. The Drake [Blacksmith] apprentice glanced at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm going to Liscor, and then Esthelm. To look into—um—can I go to each? Do I have to pay…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope! Free of charge! Which one first? Liscor? Through you go! And you just have to wait like ten minutes, tops, and the door will open! Have a nice day!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin waved after Emessa. And then she smiled to herself. &lt;em&gt;Aha!&lt;/em&gt; The other guests hurried past, staring at the inn, asking about the play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then—Erin turned back to the door and saw Grimalkin. He was standing there. Watching her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She jumped. The [Sinew Magus] eyed Erin and then stared at the door that Emessa had hurried through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Solstice. May I have a word? On behalf of…Pallass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin stared at Grimalkin. She looked at the door, and then at the [Sinew Magus]'s narked expression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw. What, am I in trouble?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The inn was back to normal. Or rather—the pain had ceased. The danger was non-imminent. For now—the inn was peaceful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And because it was, on such a day as this, Apista woke up. She was rather miffed as she flew around the Garden of Sanctuary. Someone had been having a good time. And it hadn't been her. She'd rather enjoyed the sensations, but it wasn't &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; mating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And in fact, the Ashfire Bee had a purpose today. She flitted about the Garden, busily inspecting the growing plants. They were shooting up, thanks to a certain Gnoll [Druid] who was racing around the garden with her best friend, Visma. Ekirra was grounded due to throwing a ball through a window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Soon, though, Apista flew towards the special hill at the back of the garden. There were no statues for her. But there were the flowers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Faerie Flowers bloomed in the garden, vibrant. Magical. The bee alighted on each, sucking up the nectar, spreading pollen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not getting high. &lt;/em&gt;A shock! An upset! The bee ingested the nectar, but it didn't go into her stomach-stomach, but her other stomach. Her honey-stomach, which bees had and was separate from the digestion one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bee fact. And that was deliberate on Apista's part. Now she was feeling better, she was working on her project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because Apista had a life. She was a bee who knew how to take care of herself, even if she and Lyonette were a pair. She had mixed feelings on the Pawn thing too, but at least Lyonette might increase the size of her Hive in time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And when her second stomach was full, the bee flew off. She did a loop-de-loop out of the joy of flight as she flew up, through the garden's roof. And she appeared on top of the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Worker Antinium stared as Apista flew past him. Belgrade, waking up and sitting in his room and marveling at his own &lt;em&gt;Fortress of Fluff &lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;saw Apista fly by his window. He waved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bird aimed his bow down from his tower in progress on the third floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. It is Apista. How disappointing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee flew through a window. Lyonette's. Mrsha had been the only one asleep the entire night there. But the bee was a third occupant from time to time, although she had a lovely little nest in the Garden of Sanctuary. But today—she climbed up to the top of the dresser. And there, on the top, was a bit of…hive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A few small, hexagonal cells made of propolis and other substances. Honeycomb. Just a few sections, nothing like an actual Hive with walls. The inn was her hive. And still, it was part of the Hive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A crucial part. Apista crawled over to the little container. She had to process as her insides moved for a moment. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blergh.&lt;/em&gt; She vomited the contents of her honey-stomach into the little wax honeycomb cell. Apista regarded the nectar from the Faerie Flowers she normally liked to ingest. Then she began eating the contents of her stomach and chewing it up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was adding to it, making it into honey. This was the job of a worker bee in the hive, but Apista was a bee alone. And she was…different. Not a Queen, or a Worker, or anything else. So she was doing a full Hive's job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chew, chew, chew—&lt;/em&gt;Ashfire Bees were good at making honey. So it wasn't long before Apista felt it was time. She forced the new substance out of her honey-stomach once more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apista vomited a second time and regarded the syrup that would become honey with time. That was how bees made honey. Second bee-fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was just a little bit. Not even enough to fill the cell up a quarter. So Apista covered the honeycomb with a bit of wax. She, in her vast intelligence, had made a removable lid! It still preserved the honey within.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even with her labors, the end result wouldn't be vastly impressive. It was her project. Just a bit of honey to pass the time away. She was a bee after all, and honey was food for the future. And it was fulfilling work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Was it crucial? No. It didn't really matter. It was just honey. Made from faerie flowers. Apista liked the labors of her work as she flew off to begin the laborious task of making more. She just wondered if she was doing it wrong. No one had ever taught her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…Was honey supposed to glow like that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the inn, a bee flew upside down past Erin's head where she sat at a table with Grimalkin. The Drake and Human looked at the bee for a second. That was just Apista being playful, incidentally. And maybe a tiny contact high from all that processing. Just a buzz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…As I was saying, Miss Solstice. Stop poaching our best artisans."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Credit to him, Grimalkin was by this point inoculated against minor weirdness at Erin's inn. The [Innkeeper] sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I didn't &lt;em&gt;steal—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You were heard by a number of sources. And the Assembly as well as Pallassian leadership turned to me. Because we have a relationship."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw, stop, you. We haven't even &lt;em&gt;dated!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin laughed and waved one hand. Grimalkin's expression didn't change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pelt is considering moving to Liscor. On your suggestion. That is active poaching of an exceptionally high-level individual. Miss Solstice. This is what we would recognize as economic attack or even destabilization against the Walled City. A hostile action."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"N-no it's not. I mean, I just &lt;em&gt;suggested &lt;/em&gt;it. If he's happy, it's okay, right? It's not a big deal, even if he moves. Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The huge Drake leaned over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Erin. I would not be here if it wasn't a 'big deal'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman gulped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But…what do I do? Tell Pelt not to come?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin pinched at his snout, tiredly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Unfortunately, that isn't how it works, Miss Erin. Pelt is a free individual. The wheels are in motion, to use a Pallassian term. I am telling you that you have done something that is jeopardizing your relationship with Pallass, and Liscor's by proxy. There will not be any immediate consequences…especially if Pelt does not move. But it will not be forgotten."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin looked at Grimalkin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What kinda consequences?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The kind that involve a Walled City blacklisting you. Or taking other punitive measures. Erin. Frankly speaking, I think you understand that it is better to have a Walled City &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your side?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you know your actions are punishable? You were jailed. The goodwill certain members of our society have towards you does not place you above the law. You understand that when I warn you, it is a true &lt;em&gt;warning?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yes. I'm sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin hung her head. She felt her stomach twisting a bit. Grimalkin sighed. He drummed his claws on the table as Erin fidgeted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pallass would like to be—strongly connected with The Wandering Inn, Erin. I've been aiming for that myself. This warning is, I hope, carefully taken, but without animosity."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You've been wanting Pallass to be buddy-buddy with the inn and Liscor? Aw, Grimalkin! I didn't know you cared!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin glanced up, smiling. The [Sinew Magus] looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; you ask Pelt to begin with, Erin? You're not a fool. You clearly knew…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He broke off, eying her. Erin shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought he'd be happier. That's all. I mean, it would help Liscor. But I thought Pelt would like it more."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Mage] looked incredulous. And Erin gave Grimalkin a cheerful, and unsettlingly direct smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Sometimes I like doing things that I think will make people happier. And do other things. But I like doing good things for friends. Is that strange for Pallass' leadership to consider?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake narrowed his eyes. And the [Innkeeper] glanced at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why does Pallass like me, though?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aside from the fact that you have a magical door?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Oh. So the Walled City actually &lt;em&gt;likes &lt;/em&gt;me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake had a headache. How could someone be so intelligent and so obtuse at the same time? He saw Lyonette giving him a sympathetic shake of the head as she passed by. Grimalkin shook his head slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Affection has nothing to do with this, Miss Solstice. It's about courting useful allies and individuals. Their relationship matters, but…this is a matter of forging connections. Do you—do you understand the basics of politics?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um…you make laws?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How much was deliberate?&lt;/em&gt; Erin turned as a welcome relief came for both sides. Drassi stopped at the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One…Meat Supreme Sub…and two letters for you, Erin. Street Runner from Liscor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi panted. She put down the gigantic disgrace to cuisine on the table. Grimalkin eyed the stacked meat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I heard people talking about it. Excellent. This is an absurd amount of meat you realize, Miss Solstice?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. Are you…gonna eat all of it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not even Palt and Beza and Numbtongue had managed anything close to one whole sub. Relc hadn't come by, but—Grimalkin nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's hardly…elegant. But I'm still rebuilding my body to its optimal condition. I'll digest it—I may need more drinks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Coming up! Drassi, water! And—aw, it's just more of the spam letters."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin sighed. She looked at both letters, addressed to her. Grimalkin eyed embossed lettering and rather delicate penmanship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Spam?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mhm. Junk mail. You know—it's like Pallass courting me. Wait—these can't be real, can they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Laughing, she showed him one of the letters. Grimalkin choked on his bite. The letter was from Oteslia—the other from Manus. Erin waved both as she began to fold one to make an airplane for the fireplace. Then she thought better; Mrsha liked drawing on the backs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I keep getting them. Invitations. You know, '&lt;em&gt;would you like to visit Oteslia?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Travel and lodging paid for a week!&lt;/em&gt;' I dunno, it looks like a tourist advertisement."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sinew Magus] just stared. He began thinking, and then slowly, nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They sent letters addressed to you. And you think…? No, you're absolutely right. Another piece of the puzzle. [Tourist]? Where is that a common class in…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was adding to his notes on her. Erin scowled. She liked Grimalkin. He was sort of a jerk at times, but she thought he was a genuinely good person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But like Xrn—she wasn't a Pallassian. And she didn't trust him. Heck, Erin slightly regretted telling some of her other friends. How many knew or suspected? And they didn't &lt;em&gt;know…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait, these aren't &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; offers, are they? No one just pays for people to visit! Why me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why indeed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake gave Erin a searching look. But her confusion was genuine, which in turn genuinely confused him. Erin stared down at the letter. And part of the problem was that she didn't think of herself as…important enough to be sent an offer like this. She laughed a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was Erin Solstice. She felt the &lt;em&gt;tugging&lt;/em&gt; again, from the door. And she turned her head. On days like this, there was so much she missed. So much she saw through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And it was coming. Can you feel it in the air? &lt;/em&gt;Erin could. But what, she didn't know for certain. She had plans. Plans that involved, yes, advantage to Liscor, to her inn. But also making Pelt happier. And luring him out of a city so she could ask about magic rings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because Dwarves &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; knew about magical rings. Or was that racist? And her coin. And…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Was it today? Invrisil awaited. The gates were opening, and the Horns of Hammerad stood in line, speaking with a young [Lady] who had lived in an era when three times as many nobles ruled Izril. And—was it now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City of Adventurers. As famous as Pallass, the City of Invention. But if Pallass had begun to take note of the temptress in her garden, the other city was unprepared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Unsecure. Unable to comprehend what waited. A laughing trickster that mocked law and tradition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The door entered the city. And it called to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Chaos. The Damsel of Drama. The Harbinger of Hilarity. No one ever called her these things, in point of actual fact. But her time had come again. And this city had no idea. No idea—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Was it all an accident, as she claimed? Or was it fate? Some Skill?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Or was she smart enough to plot it all out in advance? No one knew. But here was a question to keep you up at night: which would be more terrifying if true?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The next day began as Erin stared at her magical door now and then. Wondering what she was feeling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then they were at the gates. As the sun rose, so did the portcullis. And despite it all, the adventurers couldn't say it had been an entirely unwelcome night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They'd made a friend. Maviola stood with them, talking more naturally, even with Ksmvr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just stick in the city for a day or two. Tell us where you're staying; maybe we can get the same inn. We're actually delivering cargo. And you'll want to see what happens."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria was talking to Maviola, but the [Lady] herself wasn't sure if she'd be staying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't have a plan. What kind of cargo is this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She glanced at the door as the wagon rolled forwards. Ceria grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The best kind. I shouldn't say just yet, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reason for entry?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Guardsman] was yawning as he checked people through the gate. But he did a double-take as he stared at Yvlon and Ksmvr in the driver's seat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What is that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He grabbed for his weapon. Yvlon raised one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's our teammate. Ksmvr. He's an Antinium. We're the Horns of Hammerad, a Gold-rank team."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"An Antini—they're not—that's a Drake thing. No one's seen an Antinium in the north—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Guardsman] backed up. Ksmvr opened his mandibles and smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello. I am Ksmvr. I am not a monster—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Guards] heard the commotion. They aimed their bows and crossbows down at the adventurers. Ceria sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn it. Not again. &lt;em&gt;Hey! We're a Gold-rank team!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She shook her fist upwards as Maviola turned her horse, eying the suddenly very awake Watch. The [Captain] on the gates hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gold-rank?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The word was like a magic spell. Ceria sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. &lt;em&gt;Gold-rank.&lt;/em&gt; Adventurers! The Horns of Hammerad! This is our teammate! Not a ravening army!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Guards] relaxed a bit, looking shamefaced. The [Captain] stared at Ksmvr, but the half-Elf had practice at this by now. So long as you didn't let Pisces needle the local Watch, or Ksmvr didn't do anything alarming…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stand down. Someone fetch the list."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] ordered the others. Ceria sighed in relief. Pisces sniffed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I told you we should have let Ksmvr hide in the wagon and sorted it out later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We tried that. I'm not being run out of Invrisil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Soon, the [Captain] was walking out the gates. He stared at Ksmvr, but he was more interested now in Ceria's claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Horns of Hammerad? You're not on our list of Gold-rank teams."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Cryomancer] blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—we are. Ask the Adventurer's Guild."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have a Street Runner doing just that. If you're on their registry, we'll see. You are aware, Miss, that impersonating a Gold-rank team is a felony?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf gave the [Captain] a &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;. She turned to Pisces and he leaned forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain, why would we both have an Antinium teammate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; claim Gold-rank status when we're already under scrutiny?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Watch Captain's brows snapped together. He glowered, but Pisces' acerbic tone was a careful weapon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Move your wagon over there. Next! You, miss. Purpose of entry?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I may see you later. Thank you for the company."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola smiled at the Horns. She rode up to the [Guard]. They gave her a look; she had mismatching clothing, and slippers. And her horse was bareback.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;However, they didn't test her via truth spell. They were too distracted by Ksmvr, which was lucky. Maviola sighed as she rode through the gates. That might have been a problem, although she could have passed by telling them she was a [Lady] first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around as the Horns of Hammerad waited at the gates, arguing about whether they could have stormed the gate without taking a single wound. Not the kind of topic that endeared them to the Watch, but it was entertaining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What a strange group."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola smiled. She fidgeted; she was definitely sore from riding the horse without a saddle. Damn Lady Bethal's eccentricities. Then again—that was why Maviola had stolen her horse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And—just like that, she was in Invrisil. The young woman stared around at the city, with the towering buildings. One of Izril's capitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's changed so much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wonderingly, she slid from her mount's back. Her horse snorted. Someone swore as they walked around her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get your horse off the sidewalk, woman!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A man dodged around her, and waved a ring-bespectacled fist at the young woman. Maviola blinked. She pulled her horse left, nearly walked into traffic. Someone else yelled at her. It was a novel experience. No one had raised their voice to Maviola and not been immediately sorry in years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young lady smiled despite the ire. She looked around. What did you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;when you first went into a city like this? Normally, her attendant, Zedalien, would arrange everything. But now…it had been so long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stables. And then—clothes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola looked down at her dress, and laughed. She glanced around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me, do you know where the nearest stables are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A young Stitch-girl, walking and talking with an older Stitch-woman, gave Maviola a &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;. She sighed, but pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right there, Miss. &lt;em&gt;Tourists.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi commented to Dewlana and the two walked off. Maviola grinned. She debated kicking the rude Stitch-girl in the back. But then she walked off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Soon, Maviola had her horse stabled. And then she found the nearest [Tailors], without asking for directions. She entered, reassured the salesclerk that she had gold, and emerged a few minutes later in travel clothes. Maviola looked around. And the city shone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So did the young lady. People turned as she walked past. Her presence shone, even in the crowds. And so did her eyes. She looked around and smiled. The City of Adventure. A fitting place for something. Maviola El walked into the crowds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, how it's changed. I wonder if Seatale's Tavern is still open?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She walked forwards, excited. And she resolved to stay a day. If only to meet the Horns of Hammerad again. Antinium. How strange. They had just been faceless enemies two decades ago. Were they walking around now, as adventurers? She hadn't known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The thought made her feel…old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns of Hammerad were not delayed long. Soon, the [Captain] found they were indeed Gold-ranks. Newly minted ones, but still Gold-ranks. He let them in, even with Ksmvr. Because the Antinium was indeed alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was funny. Ceria had no doubt that in the south of Izril, Ksmvr's very nature might get them attacked. But in the north? The Antinium weren't as immediate; they had never passed Liscor. Pisces as a [Necromancer] was more reviled. An Antinium alone wasn't a threat, especially in a Gold-rank team. Ksmvr was treated like a strange species, like a Selphid or Drowned Man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were here. The adventurers stared around. Buildings, as tall as Liscor's very vertical city, stretched upwards. But Invrisil was far vaster than Liscor, where you could almost always see the walls boxing in the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It might have been ten times as large as Liscor. Or twenty? People of every species bustled around the walkways. A thousand sights to see. People calling out the latest attractions. &lt;em&gt;Gelato&lt;/em&gt; from Terandria, the latest sights at the Season Theatre, a menagerie showcasing a caught Griffin—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Invrisil. I remember passing through with the original Horns…dead gods, must be three years ago. Have you been here before, Pisces, Yvlon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Once. But briefly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Necromancer] murmured. Yvlon nodded, looking around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I used to visit all the time as a girl. Not so much after I became an adventurer, ironically. I always thought I'd come back here, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria nodded. &lt;em&gt;Back&lt;/em&gt;. That was the thing. The City of Adventurers had a lot of work for adventurers. It was connected to most places and you'd pass through on missions. But—it was for higher-ranking teams. You'd come back here, after making your mark. And then you'd have the coin to buy all the magical items on display, to walk into the back of the Adventurer's Guild and sit with the Gold-ranks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf found a smile crossing her face. And that was what had happened. She looked at Yvlon, who understood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're here. We made it back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It took us a while. But we did. I wish the others could have seen it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon stood, looking around the city as if she'd never seen it before. Ceria was smiling and nodding, caught between—happiness and regret. Pisces scratched at the back of his head. He looked at his two friends, and about the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr? He just stared. The [Skirmisher] turned his head, his attention rapt on this unfamiliar world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And people were staring at the Horns of Hammerad too. Not as many as you might think, but even in this city, an Antinium, Ceria's skeletal hand and Yvlon's arms stood out. The adventurers slowly drove into the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do we do first?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria had to think. Her mind was spinning. There was so &lt;em&gt;much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There's the door to Erin's inn. We should find a place to set it up. But we should go to the Adventurer's Guild. You know? Introduce ourselves. And—and—get our loot appraised!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"With that [Enchanter]. What's his name? Hedault?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. But there's also the market—and Ryoka's in the north. Maybe the Runner's Guild will know where she is? Erin said Reizmelt, but Ryoka's bound to be all over."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns looked at each other. Now, they were getting excited. Like children at a fair. Ksmvr bounced up and down, staring about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This city is very big. And colorful. I am eager to see all the tactical advantages in the stores."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria was smiling as Ksmvr looked around, eyes shining. But then she felt a lump in her throat. Her excitement faded as the most important thing came to mind for her. She looked at Yvlon and Pisces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; need to visit the Adventurer's Guild. I have to ask about Griffon Hunt—they might have come through before us. And I want to deliver some news. I'm sure they've heard, but you know, there are some families of teammates that live around here. Even in the city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon sobered. She looked at Ceria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Crossbow Stan's family lives around here, don't they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. And Gerial was born in Invrisil. I sent word—and the coin for both. But the Adventurer's Guild would be able to connect us. I'll go there, ask about."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf took a deep breath. She had sent a [Message] and the money owed to each family, of course. But she had never told any of her teammate's families how they had died. And if they wanted to know from her—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll go too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria forced herself to smile and shake her head at Yvlon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—it's just going to be an inquiry. Why don't you and Ksmvr go find that Hedault guy, Yvlon? Take him around? Keep him out of trouble? Pisces, you too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Necromancer] hesitated. He sniffed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think I'll accompany you to the Guild, Ceria. I wouldn't mind looking around the Gold-rank's section."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf smiled as Pisces adjusted his robes. Yvlon looked at Ceria, but then she saw how happy Ksmvr was. She smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That sounds good. Where should we meet?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—easiest place is probably the Mage's Guild. Let's head there in—an hour? Then we'll find an inn and set up Erin's door."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It should prove entertaining."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces remarked drolly. His team grinned. They parked the wagon at the stables and Ceria leapt down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Renting?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Hostler] walked up. He was leading Maviola's horse into a stables. Ceria saw a [Lady] and her [Chevalier] speaking to the [Stablemaster]. That was Invrisil for you; you could see noblewomen mixing with the common folk. First Landing was even more cosmopolitan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. Actually, we'd like to sell the wagon. And horses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can do. Say, why's the wagon all chewed up? This happen on some kind of adventure?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. Firewood."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Hostler] looked at Ceria. Yvlon waved to the others as Ksmvr looked about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yvlon, Yvlon. What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Looks like a sign for the menagerie. One must be in town. That's a—place to see a bunch of animals, Ksmvr. Would you like to visit it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe after we locate the [Enchanter]. What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…That's a carriage, Ksmvr."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is pink."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Yes, it is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns of Hammerad left. Ceria looked about and nudged Pisces, who was counting the coins he'd gotten from haggling with the [Hostler].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. The Adventurer's Guild is that way. Anything you want to do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sniffed. The [Hostler] glanced up as the [Necromancer] walked off. The magical door was in Pisces' bag of holding. And who the heck carried a &lt;em&gt;door&lt;/em&gt; about? The [Hostler] frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing that cannot wait, Ceria. However, I am keen to learn how much money we will make."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And to see Erin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, I suppose. It will certainly be an eventful moment when we see her. Tell me—are you tempted by the bounty on the Wyverns?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maaaaaaybe. But it sounds like trouble. The High Passes? I want to explore Invrisil, honestly. And didn't you say that you had an adventure in mind?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, well, that would be Selys' request. Further north. I fear we might be under-leveled for it, but let's first see how well we can equip ourselves…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two adventurers walked out into the crowd. The [Hostler] chewed over what he'd just heard as he tended to the two horses who'd been forced to pull the wagon for &lt;em&gt;ages.&lt;/em&gt; He was planning on rubbing them down, but he murmured the name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ceria. Ceria…where did I hear…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the sniffing. It had been described to him. The [Hostler]'s eyes opened wide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Grev's friends?&lt;/em&gt; Hey! Wait!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raced outside. But—too late, the adventurers were all gone. The [Hostler] cursed. There was a damn &lt;em&gt;finder's fee!&lt;/em&gt; Six tickets to the plays! But he'd get something for the word alone. He shouted at the [Stablemaster] and hurried off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns of Hammerad were not the only Gold-rank team in the city. Another team had recovered from their injuries and an encounter with a dark legend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Griffon Hunt had taken time to understand what they'd run into. And more crucially, decide if they were going south, to battle with Wyverns. That had been the plan, but as they nursed their injuries, Halrac had begun talking with Briganda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was poking at her ribs and leg, which up till now had been healing the minor fractures she had received. The lot were staying at the Players of Celum's inn. Briganda and Halrac, at least. Typhenous was teaching Grev a few street tricks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Briganda was bouncing her son, Cade, on her knee. She nodded at the mission request she'd pulled from the Adventurer's Guild's board.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Told you it was near your home. Riverfarm, where the Windrest folk got to. Most of them. I thought it was insane, but—read it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac did. He stared at the request, which, like the incredible bounty on the Wyverns, was an unusual piece of literature unlike most quests offered at the guild. Most were utilitarian, listing the monsters or type of assignment, defense, search and exterminate, escort, and the prices and locations as well as the guild's analysis on the threat level. But this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;By order of His Majesty, [Emperor] Laken Godart of the Unseen Empire, a Gold-rank team or high Silver-rank team is requested for a range of tasks, including treasure finding, bandit and monster extermination, and other assignment as needed on a long-term contract.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Payment is minimal per week and may be negotiated, but a share of any treasure recovered will be awarded to the team. Food and lodging will be provided for free, as will most mundane supplies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventurers must be willing to work with a variety of individuals, open to command. Also, the killing of Goblins under Emperor Godart's protection is strictly forbidden. Adventurers must be willing to refrain from killing Goblins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Below was listed the location, Riverfarm, and the pay. Halrac stared at the numbers. Even for long-term duty, it was very, very low. Barely more than a few gold per adventurer per week. For a Gold-rank team?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, that wasn't the least of it. The terms were—insane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Unseen Empire? I've never heard of it. Is that—Riverfarm, now?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. Some [Emperor] showed up out of nowhere. I heard a lot of weird rumors from there. Isn't it hilarious. It was being shown around the Adventurer's Guild for near a week. Mind you—some people would have jumped at the request if it wasn't for the last bit about the monsters."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda snorted. Halrac glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh yeah. That [Emperor] visited Invrisil, once. Left a big impression. Two Silver-rank teams went with him on some quest to his lands. Around mid-winter. Liked it so much they stayed. And there's rumors this Godart fellow has some kind of seeing Skill. Knows whatever's in his domain. But—Goblins?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Goblins."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cade repeated, and his little box of wonders produced some Goblins he instantly put on the table. Halrac saw a bevy of the [Knights] chasing the little green figures around, hacking at them. There was no blood, but—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda saw Halrac tap the box. Cade's expression went horrified as the Goblins disappeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My &lt;em&gt;box!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Halrac! Don't do that to Cade. It's okay, just make more."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No Goblins."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Veteran Scout] looked at Briganda. He read the line again. The [Shieldmaiden] glowered at Halrac and then frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's gotten into you? We've smashed enough Goblin tribes before. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Things are different now. I told you about the inn? It has a Hobgoblin. It—had more. This is an odd request."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac went back to reading as Cade glared at him and then produced some little Crelers, which his illusory [Knights] began to battle. Halrac looked at the assignment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Minimal pay. But a share of treasure…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's the funny thing. How much treasure are we getting? Treasure-finding? Eliminating [Bandits] is the work we'd be doing, I bet. And being a permanent militia. It's clever, but that's just an empty line."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Scout] nodded absently. That was what he'd have assumed. But that last line…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe it's worth looking into. We don't have to accept. Riverfarm isn't too far, and—we might go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Briganda looked up as Typhenous produced a coin behind Grev's ear. And the boy's money pouch in the other hand. Grev looked at the [Mage] with awe as the Plague Mage winked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Seriously?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have a hunch. 'No Killing Goblins'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac's mouth twitched. And he had a sense—this might be something. Briganda blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, if Halrac the Grim has a hunch…it's not far, yeah. Fancy that. Cade, we might get to visit an [Emperor]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The boy looked up blankly. Briganda was scratching at her head when the door flew open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Grev! Grev!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A boy shouted as he tried to kick past the [Bouncer], Redit. The man had him in one arm. Grev stood up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's up? Redit, that's a pal. Let him in."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The urchin tumbled past as the [Bouncer] grumbled. But Grev was of the Players of Celum and they were faces in this city, however new. The boy panted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grev! It's them! One of the [Hostlers] saw 'em, the ant-fellow, the sniffing [Mage], and the half-Elf! Ceria! He didn't catch 'em, but they're in the city!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Where?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev's eyes widened. Typhenous sat up and Halrac and Briganda turned. There was only one group with that description.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Horns of Hammerad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old [Mage] looked at Grev. The boy was panting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Southwestern gate. Is there a reward? You said, &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; tickets—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One for the [Hostler]. I'll give you one for running the information, but the rest only go to someone who brings me &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev produced two glossy pieces of paper, and the young boy's eyes went round. He snatched at one. And then Grev held out the other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Straight to the [Hostler]. It doesn't disappear. [Street's Honor]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wouldn't sell it! I'll get it to 'em—only let me out the back so I can get out!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grev led the boy out and then whirled around. His eyes were shining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did you hear? The Horns're here at last! Took them long enough! But if they're here, that means so's the magic door!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes indeed. This should be interesting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous stroked his beard, smiling broadly. Halrac didn't smile, but he did lean back in his chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Might be worth finding them to visit the inn. Briganda will want to see it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Too right! These are the new Gold-ranks, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. They're an odd team. New, but competent. We should find them and join up; the Players will want to meet them too—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi skidded into the inn around Redit as Halrac was trying to explain each member to Briganda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Halrac! Typhenous! I just heard that the Horns of Hammerad were in the city! Someone was talking about this giant bug and it has to be—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous gave Revi a smile and she stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grev just got word, Revi. The street moves faster than gossip. We were just thinking of finding them. It shouldn't be too hard. I imagine the first thing they'll do is visit the Adventurer's Guild, right, Halrac?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Scout] was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That, or the [Enchanter], Hedault."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi snorted, annoyed by the name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good luck with that. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; haven't gotten more than an appointment in two weeks, and that's just because we're established names. There's no way the Horns will…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She trailed off. The [Summoner] looked at Typhenous and Halrac. Briganda sat up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Cade, sit on the table for a second. Halrac, is this a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; Gold-rank team?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Scout] frowned. He looked at the others. Briganda raised her eyebrows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Which means they'll go to the Gold-rank section. First time?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. We have to catch them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi shot to her feet. The other Gold-rank adventurers stood up. Grev looked confused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I was gonna go out and find them. What's wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They may not know how things work, Grev. Let's go to the Guild. That should be their first stop. Briganda, can you leave Cade here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Griffon Hunt hurried towards the doors. Briganda pointed at the [Bouncer]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Watch after Cade."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Me?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man protested, but the adventurers were already out in the street. To save the Horns from themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns of Hammerad were in Invrisil. And that news was worrying. To their friends in particular. Because if Invrisil was unprepared for magic doors and Erin Solstice—the new Gold-rank adventurers weren't prepared for Invrisil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were used to Liscor and Celum. But Invrisil was one of &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; cities. It had rules which the Horns didn't know about, even if they'd visited a few times. They might have been the big cheese in a small city, but in Invrisil?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There were &lt;em&gt;rats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces and Ceria walked into the Gold-rank section of the Adventurer's Guild. Ceria was breathing a bit heavily. With nerves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She'd already checked into the Guild and inquired after the families of the deceased. That had been hard, but the [Receptionist] had assured her they'd get in contact within three days' time. Then—after verifying their rank, she'd pointed Ceria towards this room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gold-rank's bar and private area. It was, to adventurers, something of a holy land for anyone under Gold-rank status. A place everyone wanted to enter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh wow. I can't believe we're &lt;em&gt;here.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Try not to gape, Ceria. Myself, I think it looks rather plain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Plain?&lt;/em&gt; Shut your mouth, Pisces! I've dreamed of being in here! So has Yvlon!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria looked around the bar. It may have been just another room, albeit far more plush than the main room of the Adventurer's guild, but there was the board with requests meant for Gold-ranks and higher. Worn, from all the many teams who must have touched it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the room had teams in it! They turned to see the two new adventurers. Ceria stared around as Pisces, cool as a cucumber in the shade, looked about. She knew &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; was gaping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, well. Fresh meat! Are you two lost or do you belong here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A swarthy man with a bandage on one shoulder stood up. He strode over with a swagger; Ceria saw him pass by a table of three half-Elves and three Humans, who looked up and dismissed him. The man walked over to Ceria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Name's Todi. &lt;em&gt;Captain &lt;/em&gt;Todi. And you're what, greenhorns? Silver-ranks?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gold-ranks, actually. We just arrived to Invrisil. I'm Ceria, Captain of the Horns of Hammerad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria smiled. Todi glanced at Pisces. The [Necromancer] nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pisces."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi's eyes flickered. He frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Name's…familiar. Do I know you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, you two are clearly new in Invrisil. Greenhorn's stare. Know it anywhere. You have more teammates?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man's presumptuous questioning made Ceria blink, but she was still riding a high from being here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right. Two of our teammates are out, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excellent. In that case, why don't you get them and come back. Introduce yourselves properly and we'll all have a drink."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi smiled. He patted Ceria's shoulder and gestured towards the door. Ceria stared at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's customary. New teams come in together. Buy everyone a round. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt;, we talk. It's respectful. Don't worry, I'm just saving you some embarrassment. Not everyone would tell you. Off you go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He motioned them towards the door. Ceria blinked. She nearly turned, but Pisces just sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This reminds me of Wistram. Thank you. Todi, was it? You may buy &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; drinks if you wish. But we're not staying around long. Let's check out the requests, Ceria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He glanced past the man and walked past Todi. The Gold-rank adventurer's face darkened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. Rude fellow, aren't you? Sure I don't know you? You're making a mistake."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you're being quite rude yourself. How do we know &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are not new yourself, sir?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces looked back. There was a chuckle from around the inn. Some of the other Gold-rank teams were watching the spectacle. Todi blinked at Pisces. Ceria sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. That's my teammate. Pisces, be &lt;em&gt;polite&lt;/em&gt;. Thank you—Captain Todi? But my other teammates are out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She walked past Todi as well. The man looked at the two Horns and shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Brats. So that's the new generation, huh? Don't say I didn't &lt;em&gt;warn&lt;/em&gt; you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He walked back, chuckling to himself. Ceria felt a dozen pairs of eyes on her back. She hesitated—but Pisces was studying the requests board.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. Interesting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He appeared unaffected by the stares. But that was just because he was an excellent actor. Ceria looked at the requests. Or pretended to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe we should leave."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And bow to a petty little tyrant? We can play their game, or not, Ceria. This is hazing, like the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Year's swim around the island. Remember?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria nodded glumly. Wistram had their own groups like this. But—she hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone was watching. Pisces eyed a few requests, and then went to sit down. Ceria followed him. Conversation started back up, but she was aware of other teams glancing at them now and then. Amused. Todi was watching with his group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one went over to talk to the Horns, as they might in another guild. Ceria fidgeted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think, Pisces—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ignore them. I refuse to humor the man. I may have a drink. Then we can leave. Relax, Ceria. We belong here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Necromancer] leaned back and studied the bar's menu. The other adventurers began talking, and Todi's voice rose among them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;So, as I was fucking saying,&lt;/em&gt; we should muster up and head south. We lost too much time to that damn &lt;em&gt;[Witch]. &lt;/em&gt;And my team just healed up!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Head south? Maybe with one of the faster carriages. It's not going to be cheap."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then we pool our money. Sounds good?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi was leaning on a table, talking with a few other teams. Ceria stood up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm gonna talk to them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're making a mistake. You know what sort of man that is. Play their game or don't, Ceria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There's such a thing as politeness, Pisces. Hello! Are you going after that Wyvern bounty as well?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria walked over. She smiled at another Gold-rank team. The woman glanced up as Todi turned his head. The half-Elf paused and smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm Ceria Springwalker. We were just from down south, around the High Passes. We arrived in Invrisil today."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman shifted. She was athletic, clearly a [Warrior] and she carried a thin blade of some kind at her side. A [Fencer] type? She glanced at Ceria's proffered hand; the half-Elf had hidden her left, skeletal hand in her robes. Always easy to talk about it later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Jewel. Captain of Glitterblade. Pleased to meet you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she didn't take Ceria's hand. The half-Elf wavered. Some of the other Gold-ranks who'd pulled their chairs out to join the discussion looked at her. Some amused, some blank-faced. Jewel hesitated. She glanced at Todi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come back and introduce yourself properly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man grinned at Ceria. She stared at him. She withdrew her hand slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rank means a lot here, huh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gold-rank is something you earn. Even if you get certified, girl. And you two are &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; new."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria's lips compressed. There was a laugh—although Jewel and her team looked sympathetic and definitely annoyed at Todi. But he had seniority. Yet—Ceria was more like Pisces than she liked to admit. She glowered at Todi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So we should come back, introduce ourselves properly, and you'll forgive us? And we do that because everyone has, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's the way it works, girl. You want to change it? Become a Gold-ranker with experience yourself and let a little snot-ranked Silver come in and think you're equals. But you can do it when you're in my boots. But everyone else here knows that respect &lt;em&gt;matters.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi laughed at Ceria. She had heard the same kind of line back in Wistram. And—just like in Wistram, here came Pisces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Necromancer] strolled over and smiled at Todi. The man gave him a toothy grin. Pisces looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Respect does matter. Both ways, one assumes. Seniority? I don't think I've ever heard of your team. The ah…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Todi's Elites.&lt;/em&gt; We might not have been heard of in a backwater like—what? &lt;em&gt;Celum? &lt;/em&gt;But that's fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man laughed. Pisces' brows rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed not. Nor in Wistram Academy. Or in First Landing, or any other city I've ever visited. But &lt;em&gt;well done.&lt;/em&gt; Your career must have been illustrious. So much so that in your…forty years, my companion hasn't heard of you either? She would also be older than you. A different kind of seniority, then. Age is clearly not worthy of respect, only age as an adventurer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The room went quiet. Todi's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"M'boy, you have a fast mouth. But you're not exactly as smart as you look if that's how you want to introduce yourself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To a man like you? I'd prefer to say—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria kicked Pisces. He winced and she looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pisces, enough. I'm sorry about that. Captain Todi. He does have a fast mouth. And a big one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, at least one of you knows respect."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi relaxed a bit. Ceria nodded. She glanced at Pisces—he was glowering, but his mouth was shut. The rest of the adventurers saw Ceria bite her lip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I apologize, again. I didn't know you were senior adventurers. Respect &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important. I only wish I'd known. Like Pisces said, I haven't ever heard of you either."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned and walked off. Todi's face went flat as Jewel and the Glitterblades burst into guffaws and the other teams laughed too. Ceria felt a bit hot—but mostly cold. Pisces grinned as he walked after her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, we just burned that bridge. Damn it, Pisces—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You would have frozen his boots to the floor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah, yeah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria calmed down. She sat back down as Todi turned his back on them without another word. The man said something and his team laughed along. Ceria saw some of the other Gold-rank teams glancing at them, but they turned their backs too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can sort it out later. Let's leave."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces sighed. Ceria was nodding, but she didn't want to just run away after that. She glanced around. There had to be some team willing to—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh.&lt;/em&gt; The half-Elves were sitting at their table, ignoring Todi. In fact, they looked annoyed by his presence and the man made no effort to include them in his conversation. Ceria stood up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think we can at least make one group of friends. Hold on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She walked over to the team of three half-Elves and three Humans. Todi glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No fucking way. They are green as grass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Gold-ranks looked about. Jewel's mouth dropped. Ceria was waving at the other team. Two half-Elves, both female, one very young, a teenager nearing the end of her growth, and the other older—but appearing in her late twenties—looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She doesn't know. I'm going to stop—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jewel felt an arm. Todi had grabbed her. She shifted, and he let go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let them. It's their funeral. Exactly what they deserve."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman sat down slowly. She didn't like Todi at all. And she heard, in the sudden silence, Ceria's bright voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi! Are you all from Terandria? Mind if I have a seat and talk about home? I'm from The Edwivil Forest. How about you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The third half-Elf was male. He looked up. Slowly. And he stared at Ceria and then at his teammates. Incredulously. The other Humans looked similarly nonplussed. And the youngest half-Elf—dead gods, she might only have been in her twenties biologically!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Half-Elves aged as quickly as Humans, more or less, until they were of around their teen years. Then they &lt;em&gt;slowed&lt;/em&gt;. Puberty took a long time and this young half-Elf looked…sixteen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For all that, she was in this room. And she sneered at Ceria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tree rot. Everyone we meet uses the 'we're from home' line on us. Then they want to waste our attention."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The aggressive response made Ceria blink. She looked around, and then heard the beginning to at least six fights she could remember. A haughty sniff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a commonality of superfluous people. Thank you for noticing and refraining from wasting our time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces looked dismissively down at the team. Ceria groaned, but the [Necromancer] was clearly keen on not making any friends here. The young half-Elf blushed as she glared at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have no idea who we are, do you? Even that obnoxious Human knows about respect."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded at Todi. The man flushed, but he didn't call her out. Ceria began to feel uneasy, but Pisces had had enough. He rolled his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Respect, as I previously stated, goes both ways. No one here knows who we are. It would be courteous to inform us of social norms politely. Perhaps then we'd care to be polite in return. Or are Gold-rank adventurers all as petty as that obnoxious Human?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed a thumb at Todi. The Captain rose from his chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's it. I'm gonna—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other adventurers shushed him. One of the Humans—a [Warrior], shifted. He looked at Pisces—he was in his late thirties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You've got a loud opinion, fellow. But Captain Todi's right. You're walking in here, throwing a lot of weight around. Most good teams listen first."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces flushed. And that was a good point. He opened his mouth—and Ceria put a hand on his chest. She looked at the [Warrior]—his gear was clearly enchanted, all of it. The rest of the team of six was decked out. The older female half-Elf had a silver bow, gleaming with magic. Ceria pushed Pisces back and ducked her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're right. Sorry about bothering you all. We're leaving. And we'll come back and buy everyone a drink. Except Todi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around. The room was silent as Pisces turned. And then—the other female half-Elf, the older one, spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What happened to your hand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria turned. She realized she'd blocked Pisces with her skeletal hand. Now, the adventurer with the silver bow was staring at it. So did the other two half-Elves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods. What's &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf girl recoiled. Ceria flexed her skeletal hand. She addressed the wielder of the silver bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This? I lost it casting a spell. But it's nothing big. I'll introduce you to my teammate, Yvlon. One of her arms was torn off in our last big encounter. But she got better."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The line made some of the adventurers chuckle. The female half-Elf smiled. She looked at Ceria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What was that? The battle that made you Gold-ranks? What were you fighting?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Probably Mothbears."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi grumbled out loud. The half-Elf looked past Ceria and he went quiet. Ceria blinked. She had a feeling…this was the leader of the team. She looked at Pisces and he smirked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We took out an Adult Creler around the Bloodfields. And fought a bunch of Crelers with Silver-rank teams."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Gold-rank teams looked up. Jewel turned in her seat and Todi lost his smirk. The older half-Elf looked at Ceria and the male half-Elf murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hell's Wardens.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A susurration. The woman with the silver bow looked Ceria up and down. The man who'd spoke gave Pisces and Ceria a second look, almost incredulous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're telling me you took out an Adult Creler to become a Gold-rank team?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not by ourselves. There were a lot of Silver-rank teams there. And a lot more Crelers. We got torn to bits. But we took it down."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria answered modestly. The team in front of her looked at each other. The silver-bow wielder nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take a seat. Tell us about it. I've fought an Adult Creler four times in my career. I can't imagine a Silver-rank team besting one, or even a dozen. How did you get through their armor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mom!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The youngest half-Elf protested. Her mother gave her a reproving look and she fell silent. Two chairs were pulled over. Ceria was about to sit when she had to ask.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, my name's Ceria Springwalker. Can I ask who you all are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A smile. The others laughed and the half-Elf Captain, the one with the silver bow raised a hand. She &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; young. A bit older than Ceria, but…young. And her daughter was &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; young. She replied, calmly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My name is Elia Arcsinger. Named Adventurer and Captain of Arcsinger's Bows."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria's jaw fell. Pisces started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh dead gods. You're &lt;em&gt;famous!&lt;/em&gt; My entire village talked about you—I'm so sorry!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria stammered. Pisces just eyed Elia up and down as her daughter smirked. But they were at the table and Elia looked amused. Intrigued, even.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hell's Wardens.&lt;/em&gt; That was a title that had respect, even among Gold-ranks. Todi grumbled under his breath. He eyed Pisces from behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pisces. Pisces. Where do I know that fucking name? I've heard it, but I haven't met an asshole like him—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain. I know it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of Todi's teammates leaned over. He whispered. Todi shot up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I knew it! You're that fucking [Necromancer] with the bounty!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bellowed. Every head turned as he pointed at Pisces. Ceria froze. Pisces' shoulders hunched, and then he swung around. He looked at Todi's triumphant face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. And?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man faltered. Pisces looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can try to claim it. I need a new wand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then he turned around. Todi went crimson. He looked at his team, at Pisces' back, and at Elia Arcsinger. What might have happened next was anyone's guess. One more smart comment from Pisces—or Elia's frown turning into an order for Ceria and Pisces to vacate the table—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It could have been any of these things. But at that moment, the door blew open and Griffon Hunt strode into the room. Revi was in the lead, panting. She took one look at the scene and assumed the worst. And she wasn't really wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh dead gods. I am &lt;em&gt;so sorry&lt;/em&gt;. You idiots! Get &lt;em&gt;up!&lt;/em&gt; Miss Arcsinger, sorry—&lt;em&gt;get over here! &lt;/em&gt;Didn't you even bring your entire team?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She &lt;em&gt;yanked&lt;/em&gt; Pisces and Ceria up, and was dragging them to the door before anyone could blink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Halrac! Revi? &lt;em&gt;Ow, let go of my hair!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria protested. Pisces was yelping as Revi scolded them. She saw Halrac, Typhenous—and a woman she didn't recognize standing in the doorway. And she was very confused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You didn't come here with your team? Don't you know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about how this works? What did you say? That's &lt;em&gt;Elia Arcsinger&lt;/em&gt;. You can't just bother—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Revi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac put a hand out. Revi shut up and looked about. The Gold-rank teams were all staring. Todi blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know these two jackasses, Halrac?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right, Todi. We've adventured with them. So have the Silver Swords and the Halfseekers. They're new, but they're good adventurers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria blinked and the tips of her pointed ears turned red as Halrac stood with her. Had someone hit him on the head? Who was &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; Halrac? Pisces was blinking as Typhenous whispered to him, using a miniaturized [Silence] spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Half-Freaks and those insane snobs? They don't know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, Halrac. Came in here, rude as you like. To me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi emphasized the words. Halrac sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Todi, you're not the most welcoming Captain in the world. I apologize on their behalf."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He glanced at Elia's team. She waved a hand, looking vaguely amused. Halrac glanced around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's forget this happened."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fat chance of that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Todi growled. But the Gold-ranks were nodding. Todi's face soured, but Halrac saw more than a few teams looking mildly respectful. He grimaced, and motioned to the two [Mages].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Out here. Let's have a quick word."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The reunion of the two teams was held in the common room of the Adventurer's Guild. Revi hugged Ceria, to the half-Elf's surprise, and then kept scolding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You two are &lt;em&gt;idiots&lt;/em&gt;. Congratulations on your Gold-rank! Are you &lt;em&gt;insane? &lt;/em&gt;You don't bother a Named Adventurer and you have to introduce yourself, even to a muleskin idiot like Todi! You killed an Adult Creler? You have to tell us about it! Please tell me you didn't say anything offensive!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mix of compliments and insults poured over the two. Ceria was blinking as Pisces nodded at Typhenous and the [Mage] smiled back. The other woman put an arm around Revi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Revi, you're blabbering. So these are the famous Horns? Hey there. Where's the fellow with the nose problem, Revi?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria let out a guffaw. Pisces colored and Halrac took over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is Briganda. She's one of our teammates who rejoined us. Ceria, Pisces. It's good to see you. Apologies for Revi, but the Gold-rank teams do have their hierarchy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He delivered that with his classic dour expression. Ceria nodded slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's great to see you, Halrac. Sorry, I mean, thanks. We just walked in there and met that Todi guy. We—might have said a few things."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Halrac grimaced and Typhenous winced. So did Revi. Briganda just laughed. Halrac nodded to the closed door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We've all been there. Todi's…unique. But we'll smooth it over."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry about it. Todi deserves a kick in the ass. If he mouths off, I'll smack him around. I've done it before and &lt;em&gt;we're&lt;/em&gt; as senior as his team. Hello. I'm a [Shieldmaiden]. Part of Griffon Hunt; just rejoined."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She held out a hand with a warm smile. And Pisces and Ceria smiled too. They shook hands, introducing themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ceria Springwalker."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pisces."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, so &lt;em&gt;you're &lt;/em&gt;the [Necromancer]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces froze, but Briganda shook his hand. Typhenous shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everyone knows I'm afraid, young Pisces. Your bounty &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; circulated, and even if it's much lower than what it was—it is common knowledge."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some Gold-ranks'll care. But most are adventurers. You can worry about that later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And right now, we should go back in there and smooth some feathers. We can catch up later. But we need to talk to you all—and Erin. You have the door, right? We need to make sure you all don't cause trouble. Invrisil has rules. Let alone that insane Human."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi added, looking serious. Pisces and Ceria glanced at each other. Pisces tapped his bag of holding and Typhenous' eyes lit up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have it here. Yvlon and Ksmvr are going to meet us in about forty minutes, however. They're finding the [Enchanter]. Hedault."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The four adventurers of Griffon Hunt froze. Revi groaned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt; You mean, you're going to his door? Don't do that! You don't have an &lt;em&gt;appointment!&lt;/em&gt; Don't you know? Hedault &lt;em&gt;hates&lt;/em&gt; interruptions! He's going to blacklist you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two [Mages] looked askance. Revi pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hurry! Let's stop them before they annoy him! Dead gods! You rookies are nothing but trouble! Great to see you again, though. I can't wait to visit The Wandering Inn. And the Players want to see you. &lt;em&gt;Hurry up!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Invrisil had rules. Unfortunately, no one wrote them down. They were just unspoken rules. Things people 'should' know, but usually found out by erring. It was all status and connections. Respect, unearned or not, and proper procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Was that better than Pallass, where laws were the &lt;em&gt;law?&lt;/em&gt; It was hard to say. In any case, it didn't matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is clearly the house. I appreciate the nameplate. This is an organized system."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr pointed to the nameplate over the small apartment in the upscale area of Invrisil. Yvlon nodded, eying the thick, enchanted door. There was something like a scrying orb—or half of one inserted into the door. Like a peephole, but magical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, the apartment looked magical in itself. And rich. The sign plate read: &lt;em&gt;Hedault—[Enchanter]. &lt;/em&gt;Nothing more. Ksmvr walked up to the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr, maybe I should knock—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too late. The Antinium used the door knocker and rapped a few times. He stood back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Silence. The door didn't open and no sound came from within. Ksmvr looked at Yvlon. She shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe he's out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He is not, though. I see a light through that window."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium pointed at a window. Yvlon squinted and saw, behind a closed blind, a flash of magical light. She blinked. Ksmvr was observant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True. Maybe he didn't hear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I shall knock again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rap, rap&lt;/em&gt;. This time Ksmvr was louder. Yvlon saw the people on the street staring at him, but no one was screaming. A good sign. Ksmvr happily rapped on the door six times. Then eight. Then twelve…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr, I think you're knocking too long."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But perhaps he is short of hearing. I should keep knocking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He began to knock again and Yvlon was raising a hand when the scrying orb flashed. Ksmvr leapt back, drawing a shortsword and his Forceshield in a moment. Yvlon saw words writing themselves in the air, in an irritable, fast scrawl, as if someone was writing them with a quill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NO SOLICITORS. BEGONE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The words hovered, and then vanished. Ksmvr and Yvlon looked at each other. Some of the pedestrians saw the armed Antinium and backed up fast. Yvlon took no notice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, he clearly heard that. Maybe he's busy. We can try again later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr sheathed his blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But he owes us a favor. That is what Ryoka Griffin said. &lt;em&gt;Hello? Enchanter Hedault! We are a team of adventurers who would like to speak with you! We are the Horns of Hammerad! I believe a favor is owed and we are here to collect it!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He put two hands to his mandibles and bellowed at the apartment. Yvlon shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ksmvr! That's not how you address someone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How should I do it, then?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium was walking towards the window where the light had been, waving his spare hand. Yvlon was about to tell him to come away and explain the intricacies of speech vis-a-vis what sounded like a threat when she heard marching boots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There it is!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone pointed. Yvlon groaned as she saw a squad of Invrisil's [Guards] appear around the corner. They jerked when they saw Ksmvr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apparently, word hadn't spread fast enough about him. Because the Watch leveled their weapons at Ksmvr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halt!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Their leader, a female [Sergeant], aimed a hand-crossbow at Ksmvr, looking unsettled. Yvlon moved. She put her hand out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lower your weapons. That's my teammate, an adventurer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Watch stared at Yvlon. They stared at her arms. Ksmvr looked up, and then crept over to the window. He peered through the little gap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello? I am an adventurer. Are you alive? I believe a favor is owed. Hello? …Is it w—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon looked at him, cursing, but the Watch was spreading out. The [Sergeant] pointed at Ksmvr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that thing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's Antinium—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Antinium?&lt;/em&gt; Those are just Drake stories!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the [Guards] cried out. Ksmvr turned his head and someone drew back on an arrow. Yvlon blocked them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's an &lt;em&gt;adventurer.&lt;/em&gt; I'm a Gold-rank adventurer. We're part of the Horns of Hammerad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Gold-rank team?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sergeant] blinked at Yvlon, and then at Ksmvr. But her nerves had overtaken her sense. Ksmvr looked like a giant bug-man—a monster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm confirming this with the Adventurer's Guild. You two, you're…being escorted to the guild."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon ground her teeth. This was a familiar scene. At least the Watch hadn't actually attacked; there had been incidents in the other settlements they'd come to. But Yvlon was getting tired of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not necessary, [Guardswoman]. We've already been let through the gates by the [Captain]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And I'm a member of the Watch. We're &lt;em&gt;confirming&lt;/em&gt; this! The city's already under curfew at night after the attack! You could have snuck in!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sergeant] snapped back. She was throwing rank at this point. Yvlon glowered. Petty woman. She shook her head, trying to keep her voice reasonable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't want to make a scene, Guardswoman. My teammate is clearly not a monster. He is a registered adventurer through Liscor's Guild and he has taken on numerous requests in the north—you can contact Celum's Adventurer's Guild. He hasn't—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Enough. Silence. Both of you! You're under arrest—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon reached the end of her patience as the [Sergeant] snapped at Ksmvr, who was tapping on the glass window with one hand. As the [Sergeant] marched past her, Yvlon turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Armsmistress] reached out and &lt;em&gt;grabbed&lt;/em&gt; the [Guardswoman] by the shoulder. She yanked the woman over and stared at her. The [Guardswoman] yelped and struggled, but Yvlon was &lt;em&gt;strong. &lt;/em&gt;She held her effortlessly. The other [Guards] stared as Yvlon spoke into the woman's face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Yvlon of House Byres. Magnolia Reinhart, the [Lady] of Invrisil, is my aunt by relation. Ksmvr of the Free Antinium is my teammate and I vouch for him. If you would like to question my authority, you may forward my complaint to Invrisil's [Mayor]. I will discuss the matter with them. Or Lady Reinhart herself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sergeant] stared. Yvlon let go and the woman staggered back. She looked at Yvlon, and the noblewoman folded her arms. The [Sergeant] backed away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady—um—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lady &lt;/em&gt;Byres. Well? Your response and name, [Sergeant]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr, staring through the window, saw movement. The magical light went out. He turned as the patrol marched off. The Antinium had left it to Yvlon, as he had been instructed to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are we under arrest, Yvlon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman shook her head. She ran a silvery hand through her hair and cursed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Ksmvr. But that was unpleasant."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You utilized your superior station quite effectively in establishing dominance, Yvlon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium smiled, but Yvlon did not. His compliment had the opposite effect. She shook her head, looking guilty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't compliment me, please. That wasn't…good of me to do. I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to be reasonable, Ksmvr. Someone has to be. I hate pulling rank. Or acting like Pisces. Don't do what I just did. Unless you have no other choice."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr analyzed the contradictory statement and added it to his list of lessons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Yvlon. I will not do so unless necessary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Silversteel Armsmistress] smiled wanly at him. She nodded to the [Enchanter]'s door. People had seen the commotion and were staring from afar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think we've caused enough trouble. Let's go and sort it out later, Ksmvr. We shouldn't bother people."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But we have a debt—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Remind me to teach you what politeness is, Ksmvr. And no, Pisces is seldom polite. Ceria either, for that matter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two were walking off when the door to the [Enchanter]'s home opened. A man appeared in the doorway. He snapped after them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are you disturbing me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr and Yvlon turned around. Ksmvr brightened, but Hedault was looking decidedly &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;happy. His eyes locked on Ksmvr and he frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My apologies. Master Hedault?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is my name. You have wasted my time and interrupted me as I was working. You two are now blacklisted from my services, as is your team. If you continue to linger, I will inform the Watch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He tapped his left wrist twice with one finger, a tic. Yvlon winced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Master Hedault, I apologize for—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Name your team and leave and I may consider removing your blacklisted status. I do not have time to waste on worthless apologies."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man's voice was sharp. Yvlon bristled and tried to think of something diplomatic to say, and Ksmvr raised a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Enchanter Hedault, I believe you have much time to waste if you do not honor your debts. Is, perhaps, your unwillingness to answer the door a sign that you are being hunted by [Debt Collectors]? This would be a most disturbing turn of events."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon and Hedault looked at Ksmvr. The [Enchanter]'s mouth opened and closed twice and Yvlon put a hand on Ksmvr's shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Please stop talking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why? I am only informing Master Hedault that he is refusing to honor his commitment to us. Ryoka said he would. Either she has lied, or he has."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Enchanter] started at the name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ryoka Griffin? And her…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes narrowed. He tapped his wrist again, twice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Are you the Horns of Hammerad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon turned her head. She nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's correct, sir. We are."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Enchanter] pinched the bridge of his nose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. The similarities. And your need of my services?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon opened her mouth, but Ksmvr spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We would like to appraise a number of artifacts retrieved from the dungeon. Some may be cursed, and we have jewels, gold of uncertain purity, and other mundane objects. We also were told we had a debt we could collect on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hedault blinked at Ksmvr. The Antinium's precise answer made the [Enchanter] focus on him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see. Which dungeon?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Liscor's. Do you intend to honor the debt? I am Ksmvr, by the way. Hello. I am an Antinium. Not a monster."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man's gaze focused on Ksmvr. On his shortsword and the bucker on his side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. The Ring of Jumping, Barkskin, and the Forceshield. I see. Liscor's dungeon? In that case…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Master Hedault, Master Hedault! Stop annoying him, you idiots!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Revi shot around the corner. Again, too late. Yvlon turned and saw her team and Griffon Hunt running at her. Revi, breathless, shoulder-charged into Yvlon. She bounced off and fell down; Yvlon was too solid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am so sorry, Master Hedault. They didn't know. We'll make an appointment—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Enchanter] blinked at the second team of adventurers. His eyes focused on Halrac.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Griffon Hunt? Your team is scheduled in two weeks. Are you related to this team?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They have treasure from the dungeon too. We would also like it appraised as part of our debt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr put in helpfully. Revi raised a hand to slap it over his mouth and stared at his mandibles. She lowered the hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hedault looked at Ceria. No, at her &lt;em&gt;wand.&lt;/em&gt; He stared through her, at Pisces, noting the [Necromancer]'s ring. He saw Halrac opening his mouth, grimacing, and nodded a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I understand. I will make time. Tomorrow. Come at dawn. Bring both team's treasure. Kindly make the Antinium stop peeking through my window."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He stepped back. Both Gold-rank teams stared as the [Enchanter]'s door swung closed. Revi gaped at Yvlon and Ksmvr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait—did he just say you're visiting tomorrow? He &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; does that!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He owes us a debt. He was a most agreeable person. Very precise. Hello, Revi. Hello, Halrac, Typhenous, and whomever this woman is. I see we have met Griffon Hunt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ksmvr smiled happily. Yvlon exhaled, and looked at Griffon Hunt. The established Gold-rank team looked at each other. Typhenous raised his white brows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Master Hedault is notoriously difficult, as befits the best [Enchanter] in all of Invrisil. Even the nobility must avoid offending him. He must owe a rather large debt. More than I expected."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"From Albez. Yeah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria was panting. Pisces was not. The [Necromancer] turned, looking somewhat exasperated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We appear to be doing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; wrong. Except, unless I heard incorrectly, we are now scheduled for tomorrow with Master Hedault. Should we return to the Adventurer's Guild to kowtow now?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other adventurers looked at the Horns of Hammerad. Revi was panting, but as she looked at Pisces' somewhat smug expression, Ceria's bemusement, Yvlon's confusion and Ksmvr's happy innocence, she had to finally reconsider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Look at them. The Horns of Hammerad. They were rookies in a new city, unaware of &lt;em&gt;how things should be done&lt;/em&gt;. As they headed back to the Adventurer's Guild, catching up, the Gold-rank teams within talked about the team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Necromancer]. An Antinium? They were oddballs. Idiots. And they had no sense of the way things worked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Still—look. And listen. The Horns of Hammerad never made it to the Adventurer's Guild. They were intercepted, just outside of it. By a crowd and a familiar set of faces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ceria! Pisces! Is that &lt;em&gt;Yvlon?&lt;/em&gt; And Ksmvr!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Drake cried out. Jasi, radiant, spread her arms. And the Gold-rank adventurers heard a roar from outside. They peeked out of their private space. And saw a crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Players of Celum were in the street. All of them. The first-stringers, the A-team. Wesle, Jasi, Kilkran, Yimur, Pralcem, Emme—being led by a triumphant Grev.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And their admirers filled the streets. A group of [Bodyguards] had to keep them back. Jasi embraced Ceria and the half-Elf blinked at the resplendent Jasi. She looked completely different. Radiant. Wesle was beaming and slapping Pisces on the shoulder. The [Necromancer] stared past him at the cheering crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No fucking way. Is that the Players of Celum?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gold-rank teams were coming out of their bar, because even they were fans. Arcsinger's Bows and Elia Arcsinger herself emerged with the Gold-rank teams to see—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Horns of Hammerad, standing in the middle of the crowd. Emme was shaking Ksmvr's hands as he shook Kilkran's and Yimur's at the same time. The Gold-rank team's jaws fell off their faces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that the Players of Celum? We have tickets for them tonight! But they didn't have time to visit &lt;em&gt;us!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Elia's daughter exclaimed. The Gold-rank teams saw Pisces flourishing, smiling broadly. Yvlon's arms were drawing every eye. And Jasi was hugging Yvlon now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Star power. The Horns of Hammerad stood in the middle of it all, bemused, amazed. And Todi slowly swallowed his tongue. Because they didn't know how things should work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But clearly—people didn't know who they were talking to, either. How big &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; these cheeses? Ceria started laughing. She hugged Wesle and looked around. Halrac was bemused, Revi shocked but smiling. And Ceria saw Pisces feeling at his bag of holding, looking at the others. He met her eyes and she nodded. Typhenous was watching the [Necromancer]. Invrisil began to turn around the Horns of Hammerad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it had seen nothing yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Something was up. But only the Players of Celum, Griffon Hunt, and a few others knew what yet. As they practically carried the Horns back to their inn, the door awaited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But no one knew. And other people were living their lives, separate from the drama that was the Horns of Hammerad's life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El walked through Invrisil. She had a little snack of a sandwich in her hand. She was savoring each bite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even her taste buds were fresher. The &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt;. The feeling of being able to walk, to breathe in the air and not cough or feel cold. She felt alive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alive—and older. The [Lady] paused in front of a shop. And she stopped eating. She looked around. And then, slowly entered the shop. She asked a question, and then slowly walked out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Seatale's Tavern."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] stood in the street, and looked at the shop. Next to it was a [Seamstress]' shop. And this place was a Cloth District, filled with Stitch-Folk. They glanced at the young [Lady]. And she looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was right here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the tavern was gone. Closed, turned into this shop and the Stitch-Folk's parlor. Over two decades ago. That was what the [Shopkeeper] had kindly told Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had been—amused to know that anyone still remembered that old place. Maviola looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even the street was different. It was called Satin's Way. But it had had a different name, long ago. Maviola tried to remember. But her memory was fading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The cobblestones were the same. Similar, to the ones of long ago. But nothing else was. Maviola felt a pit in her stomach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She slowly bit into the sandwich. But the explosion of flavor, the joy of eating it with strong teeth—it suddenly soured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The food turned to dust. Maviola lowered the sandwich. And she looked around. And everything was different. That wasn't the problem. The problem was knowing what should be. What had been. And realizing how much had changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I walked this very street. Sixty years ago. This very place. And nothing remains."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman whispered. Dewlana, returning to her shop, glanced at Maviola and checked the stitching on her ears. And Maviola felt—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wrong. She stumbled away from the street full of memories. Because like ghosts, they clung to her. She walked away. And she realized—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Reinhart is dead. Magnolia owns this land now. All the other nobility moved back north. Who—who—was I going to call on?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one.&lt;/em&gt; The young woman looked around. And realized she was alone. Everyone she had known, all her old friends, even her enemies—almost all were dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The world had moved on without her. And that was fine. She had seen it. Lived it. That was fine. But Maviola El suddenly realized that she didn't know what to do next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had planned for this ending. Hoarded her personal fortune, bought three vials of miracles. And she had reclaimed her youth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet she was now aimless. She had wanted to reclaim her youth from her armchair. But now, having it, reliving her memory, she realized how much had passed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Maviola El. Matriarch of…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman trailed off. And she realized that was no longer true, either. She had left the House of El. Her duties had gone. The weight that she had carried for decades had been like the wheelchair. A prison. But it had also meant she had been strong enough to carry it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Now—she was unbound. What did she have to live for, these last weeks? Maviola stumbled, as she walked. And her footsteps grew slower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All her physical pains were gone. But this world—the changes cut her deeper than any blade or ache. Look. She remembered a different city. It was too tall now. Magnolia had made it a capital. But everything was different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El had been happy, a minute ago. Living, breathing, rejoicing in her youth. But happiness becomes sadness in a moment. Darkness engulfed her heart, moving at the edges of her vision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's so…different. What was I going to do? There's no one alive. Only…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She began to count on shaking fingers. Less than ten. Less than ten, enemies and friends. Maviola looked around, and had to rest her hands on her legs. She stopped, by the side of the street, as people glanced at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A beautiful young lady. Maviola looked around. There was so much she could do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Find love, drink, explore, run as fast as she dreamed. And yet—she suddenly felt it. Her age. It crept up on her, making her breath slower. Her heart faltered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was old. And it was more than a word you could throw off with a magic spell. And this place—this was all wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She shouldn't have come here.&lt;/em&gt; Because it just told Maviola her time was over. Her memory had faded away. Just like her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman sank to her knees. Something was wrong with her heart. It was beating too slowly. She touched her chest. She heard it thumping. And waited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the next beat was too late. Maviola lay with her back to a wall, breathing slower. She reached for something. Something to blaze for. But they were all gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she would like to go too. She had made her peace. Why had she wanted another week? A day was enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was enough. Maviola saw some people peering at her with concern. But the [Lady]'s gaze was fading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's all left me behind. When did that happen?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me? Miss. Are you alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Maviola saw a figure waving a hand at her, concerned. So &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt;. They were all young, but for the half-Elves. And they went mad with age. It was so hard to be old. She sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And on the street, a slow-rolling carriage halted. A door opened. And a voice tsked. The young man waving at Maviola turned. And the young lady, the old lady, heard a voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You look unwell, Lady El. Are you quite alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The voice was familiar. Maviola's eyes moved. She blinked. Magnolia Reinhart was standing over her, smiling. Ressa stood behind her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola breathed. She knew Magnolia. But…she didn't think to ask why Magnolia was here. Dreamily, she spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magnolia? I feel silly, all of a sudden. I was so fired up. And now, I feel quite tired."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart gracefully sat on the ground. Maviola jerked her head. Her vision was…dark. And her heart. Fading, not because it was weak physically. But because her soul was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's all so…different. Good. But different. I saw an Antinium. An adventurer. Are they…no longer monsters? Everything's changed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Magnolia. And the [Lady], not the girl Maviola remembered, smiled. At least the smile was the same. Mischievous, bold, and fearless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. And they are still our enemies, Maviola. There are just—new things happening. But the garden of Izril is infested with insects. And the guardians of Izril must prune them away. As we always do. That is the same."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Guardians?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola breathed. She raised her head and shook it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're not guardians. You are. A soldier, to fight the Goblin King. And the Antinium. Perhaps we need you. But we are caretakers, not guardians."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A small difference."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. You don't understand. Then—that Antinium—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman breathed again. Her heartbeat increased. She saw Magnolia Reinhart, looking at her. Ressa stood with Reynold, keeping the passersby back. And two [Ladies] gazed at Maviola from the carriage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think I fell down. I felt so tired. And I do, despite the potion. Is it flawed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't believe so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then I'm just old."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola closed her eyes. The Lady Reinhart nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Quite."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young Lady Firestarter opened one eye. Magnolia smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Maviola El. Presumptuous as it may be, may I ask you to stand? You shouldn't rest here. Not now. There is still something left for you to do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia reached down. And her hands squeezed Maviola's hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt;. Find it, I pray you, Maviola. Age wears you down. But you must not sleep. Wake &lt;em&gt;up.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her voice deepened. And it grew urgent. Maviola felt herself stirring as the other [Lady] held her hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Age is your foe. But keep moving. Find something to do, even if it is selfish. But don't lie there. Stand. Move, and burn. Fire dies when it stops moving. Maviola, do you hear me? &lt;em&gt;There is still something for you to do, isn't there?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had a meeting to go to. The Lady El inhaled. And her heart began to beat faster. Her vision slowly swam back. And she remembered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked up. And she saw Magnolia more clearly. Slowly, Maviola's head rose. She got up, looked around at the small crowd, at herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. I think I nearly died."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I feared as much. Do you feel yourself, Lady El? A stamina potion might help—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia brushed off dirt from her dress. She studied Maviola, as the [Lady] looked around and blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—shouldn't have come back. Memory changes. Thank you, Magnolia. That was most fortunate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It would be a poor ending. I think Invrisil is not for you, Lady Maviola. If you wish it, my carriage can take you somewhere—new."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, no. And yes. But I will find my own way away. I have a meeting to keep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola smiled. She looked back once, but then shook her head. Not yet. She clutched at her heart and breathed deeply. Savoring each breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not yet. &lt;/em&gt;She had forever to rest. But what was the point if she wasted even a second? She looked at Magnolia, slightly mystified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are you here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] gave Maviola an infuriating smile. Maviola remembered she always hated that little upstart smirk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have business in my city. But I wanted to make sure you were quite well. I bid you adieu, Lady El."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Their meeting had not been coincidence. But Maviola simply nodded and watched the coach roll off. Then, shaken, she walked forwards. Searching. For a flame without fuel did go out. If it stopped, it died. She wondered how Magnolia had known that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then the young woman walked on. Searching for that source.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Magnolia Reinhart settled back in her carriage and watched the young lady with hair like embers in the darkness disappear into the crowds. She looked sideways as Ressa joined her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Apologies, ladies. I had to make a quick check. To our appointment, Reynold."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At once, Lady Reinhart."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The famous carriage began to move. It rolled down the street. And Magnolia turned to her two guests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Pryde and Wuvren. They sat in the carriage, Pryde impatient, Wuvren staring after Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What a [Lady]. When I was a girl, I grew up to stories of Lady Firestarter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She seemed rather insipid to me. Her flame is long past."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde tossed her head. Magnolia &lt;em&gt;tsked&lt;/em&gt; gently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are in a foul mood, Pryde. Maviola deserves all of our respect. It cannot be easy, watching the world change."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two [Ladies] glanced at Magnolia. She had been rarely intense as she held Maviola's hand. Pryde just turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You said you had grave need of our aid, Magnolia. But so far we've been idly circling the city. I grow tired of discussion. What is it you want of us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—first of all, I have gifts. We're nearly at the [Seamstress] I mentioned. Ah, but she does hair very well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The carriage stopped in a Human district. The three [Ladies] got out as Reynold and Ressa swept forwards. The [Hairdresser] herself, the best in all of Invrisil and Magnolia's personal stylist, hurried forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Reinhart! And Lady Ulta and Lady Sitil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wuvren, if you please."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Wuvren smiled, and she was as young as Maviola. She didn't match with Pryde and Magnolia; both women were older, although Pryde was about three years younger than Magnolia. But then—that was Wuvren.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She could be middle-aged, or a young flower, or anywhere in between in a moment. And it was almost always the age and appearance that struck the hearts of those around her most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Deepest apologies for the delay, Cedava. We might have to hurry. I hate to rush your art, but…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at &lt;em&gt;all, &lt;/em&gt;Lady Reinhart. We will work our fastest and best. We have the designs ready, and the clothing. We've been waiting for you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Hairdresser] swept the three [Ladies] forwards, and her famous salon's windows were shrouded. Pryde glanced at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is something wrong with my dress? This is the height of fashion in Ulta."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And indeed, it was a Terandrian dress, much in style with that lace that critics claimed was good for strangling yourself with. Magnolia laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pryde, this is something special I've been saving. Do me a favor and don't judge until you see it—and the hair style. Cedava has a picture, don't you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Balerosian woman was nodding and showing Pryde an image. The [Lady of Pride] hesitated as she blinked at the image. Wuvren murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh my. And is that one of me? I can certainly—accommodate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She aged up a few years, struck the pose. Some of the assistants in the salon murmured. Pryde was striking, her features as strong as her personality. But she was a contender for one of Izril's beauties, even if it was in her age bracket. Wuvren on the other hand had dominated the top list all her life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;If anything, Magnolia was the odd duckling. But that was only by comparison. The [Lady]'s eyes twinkled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought you'd like it. Well then, [Ladies]? As I said, we have much work to do. Reynold, we'll be busy. Kindly pick up our guest?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All the women turned, half in outrage; Wuvren was already being undressed. Pryde turned fearlessly, but the [Butler] had his back to the entire affair and it hadn't moved once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At once, Lady Reinhart."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ressa will mind us until then. Try to be tactful?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely, Lady Reinhart. Shall I pick you all up?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, simply meet us at our destination. We shall walk. And I'm sure we'll enjoy the attention."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia saw the [Butler] exit the salon. Then she turned. And she clapped her hands together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Time, [Ladies]! We are on a schedule."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The pink carriage rolled down the street. Most people stared, but only as they did with idle curiosity, knowing that it was Magnolia's famous carriage. As it rolled, it passed by a young woman who hid from the carriage. But Reynold took no notice and Magnolia Reinhart was absent from it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose hurried down the street after the carriage had left. She turned the corner, searching. She didn't take long to find the person she was looking for. Because he was standing on the corner, holding out his hands and shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alms? &lt;em&gt;Alms for the poor?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh my god."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose hurried towards him. Another young man appeared, leading another group at the same time. Rose reached the other young man and looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kevin. Are you insane? What are you doing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Begging? We need money, Rose. What are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; doing? I've got…one silver and three coppers. People think it's funny."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man stared at her challengingly. Rose shook her head, at a loss. She saw another figure, leading more of their group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Joseph! Where have you been? I've been trying to contact Ryoka, but they said she's on a run!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man rubbed at his head. he was sober, since their group had run out of coin. Imani and the other people from Earth were standing with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are you all here? I thought we were going to look for jobs!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose snapped at them. She was angry. They were out of coin, and yes, she was responsible for part of it for tipping their [Wagon Driver] and escorts, but everyone had mismanaged the coin. And now they couldn't even find work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's settled, Rose. We'll have enough money to rent an inn tonight. Not a good one, but we can figure out if we're going to keep heading to Liscor tonight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph stuck his hands in his pockets. He looked…miserable. Imani, nervous, glanced around as Rose threw up her hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;How?&lt;/em&gt; Did you steal the money?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I sold my sword. I got a good price for it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose was appalled. Joseph looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry. I haggled for it. Hard. I went to six shops and checked the prices. I'm not an idiot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You just &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt; one of our only weapons."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. Because I'm not good with it. I've seen our [Guards] training. And the Pithfire Hounds. I'd just get killed. Now we have money."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, what did you want to do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Alms! &lt;/em&gt;Thank you, Miss. Alms for the—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph scowled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't be an asshole, Kevin. Stop shouting at people. They'll arrest you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey! I'm making &lt;em&gt;money—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We should be trying to meet the Players of Celum! Not wasting time like this! Why are you all following Joseph?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose snapped at the others. Joseph closed his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rose! We're not seeing a play! We can't afford it and unless Ryoka gets money to us, we have to find our way to Liscor by ourselves!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked worried. Rose glared at Joseph. Neither one was in charge, or rather, both thought they were, so that led to these fights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If we could just find one of the Players—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're famous. We're nobodies and we have &lt;em&gt;no money&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph snapped back. Rose pointed at one of the big posters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But they could help us! Didn't you see the play they're putting on? It's &lt;em&gt;Pygmalion! &lt;/em&gt;They know about &lt;em&gt;home!&lt;/em&gt; Don't tell me we shouldn't—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It could be a trap. We're going to Liscor. Ryoka warned us about Wistram."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, she took our electronics and left us &lt;em&gt;here—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, guys. Chill."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Shut up, Kevin!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose and Joseph shouted at him. The young man raised his hands and backed up. The two young people began to argue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is all your fault, Rose. Not mine. If you didn't give away our money."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thought we had more! Everyone else kept borrowing from the money pouch, even though I said—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're the one who looked at our coins and said 'yeah, that's all we have, why don't I give it away to these people?' You &lt;em&gt;tipped&lt;/em&gt; them the last of our coin!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you were &lt;em&gt;drunk&lt;/em&gt; half the way here!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The passionate argument was attracting attention. Kevin furtively edged away and kept begging. One of the [Beggars] was taking notes from his unique style. But then—Rose began to sniff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wiped at her eyes. Joseph broke off and the other Earthers looked askance. Rose was angry, and crying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We messed this up. Why does it always go &lt;em&gt;wrong?&lt;/em&gt; I tried. But we're not Ryoka. Or that other girl. I tried so &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It'll be okay. We're nearly there. Well…no, but we can try. We just have to work. No more Gnoll [Maids]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Joseph murmured, trying to cheer up Rose. But the young woman was miserable. The group stood there. And at that moment, a young woman walked past Kevin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alms for the poor, Miss?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man tried hopefully. The woman's head turned. And she blinked at Kevin, and then at Rose. The tableau of despairing young people, the begging Kevin—Maviola El took it in with a glance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And unlike everyone who'd passed by, the [Lady] turned. She looked past Kevin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that your friend?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—yeah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin lowered his hands. Maviola El hesitated. But she had nothing to do. And here was a crying young woman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. Are you all in trouble?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose, sniffing, turned. Joseph saw the young woman with the striking eyes like embers looking at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—I'm sorry. It's nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're poor. Anything you can spare will help us out, Miss."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kevin helpfully interjected. Rose glared at Kevin. He looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? What happened?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We ran out of money. We were heading south."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose sniffed. Maviola looked at the group. She stared at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Small embers. What's your class?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…[Mage]? We're just…travellers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tourists."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Visitors from another—&lt;em&gt;ow!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Earthers responded. Maviola smiled and chuckled a bit. She looked at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you hungry?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A stomach rumbled. Imani's. The girl blushed, but the she couldn't help it. Maviola laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why don't you come with me? I'm going to find some friends and have a meal. I can at least treat you to one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She felt at her belt pouch. She had almost no money left. Which meant for a [Lady] that she could probably buy a good horse or two. Certainly as many meals as she wanted. The Earthers stared at each other. They huddled, quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe it's a trick?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't look a gift horse—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We shouldn't—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm just going to an inn. You can follow me if you like. But I don't mean you any harm. My name is Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] called out. And she &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt;. And the Earthers looked at her. And Lady Firestarter conjured a small fire. In her, in their hearts. They looked at each other. And then followed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El smiled. She had no idea who these lost young people were. But they were in distress, and wasn't helping them a good use of her time? She reached for her soul and found it burning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the pieces came together. Like this. The Horns of Hammerad stood in the Players of Celum's inn, talking and listening to old friends. They had told the story of the Adult Creler. Revi had wondered over Yvlon's arms, admiring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was so much to say and do. Too much for one encounter. Ksmvr had just encountered Cade and the young boy was staring at the Antinium. So was his mother. Halrac was showing around the request for adventurers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jasi was autographing one of the cardboard squares for Pisces, and he, being Pisces, had done one for her. Wesle was listening to Ceria as Andel took rapid notes about the battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But—they were all waiting on one thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The door.&lt;/em&gt; Typhenous was inspecting it; it was set up against one side of the room. And both Pisces and Typhenous had sent a [Message] spell, to the Mage's Guild and Montressa respectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is going to change so &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;. We have a play tonight; I hope Erin opens the door so she can attend! We have a box reserved for you all. And just imagine! We could perform in &lt;em&gt;Pallass&lt;/em&gt; and Invrisil! Temile has more [Actors] for us—this is going to rock Invrisil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emme predicted. Everyone was nodding. But Ceria looked at Wesle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One person's going to rock Invrisil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Actor] smiled. His voice deepened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, the Crazy Human of Liscor. The leader of Goblins, the [Innkeeper] herself. &lt;em&gt;Erin Solstice.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone smiled or laughed. Halrac rolled his eyes, but he was sitting near the door. Typhenous smiled as he straightened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everything looks fine from this end. Miss Solstice probably has yet to see the [Message]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll head through. As many as we can. And then—perform! We have some guests scheduled—I just want Erin to see how much I've improved!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Jasi fussed as she looked around. Grev laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'll blow her socks off, Jasi! And her trousers too! And that'd be a sight to see!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grev, you little imp—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Excuse me! Ceria Springwalker, are you there? Pisces? Horns of Hammerad?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a shout from the doorway. Ceria's head turned. She heard a scuffle. Redit, the [Bouncer], stumbled back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Gah! &lt;/em&gt;Stay back!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A young woman with hair like fire entered—no, wait. Her hair &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El blazed. And the [Bouncer] flinched back as fire raced up her arm. She walked through the door. The Horns turned. Ceria saw Redit reaching for a club as a second [Bouncer] charged forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, wait!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria pointed. Ice engulfed Redit's arm, shooting up from the floor as he raised a club. Maviola saw the half-Elf check the second [Bouncer] with an ice wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maviola?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young [Lady] smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Apologies. Am I intruding? I heard you were here. I can leave."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, no! Come in! I mean, if that's okay?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who is &lt;em&gt;this?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Kilkran stared at Maviola as her hair went out. The [Lady] blazed like a beacon, as strongly as Wesle or Jasi. She smiled, fearless, as Redit backed up and Ceria made the ice melt. And behind her came a group of young people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is Lady Maviola Imarris. And these are—?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Friends I met. I hope they're not intruding?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola gestured to Rose and Joseph, Imani, and the others. They stared wide-eyed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh my god. The Players of Celum?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose squeaked. Pisces' head rose and turned. But everyone else was shouting at Redit, telling him to back off, and asking Maviola what that Skill was. Ceria was looking at Wesle. He pitched his voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ladies and gentlemen!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Actors], adventurers, and everyone else quieted. Wesle looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think any friends are welcome here. Let's have that door closed before anyone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; shows up. We have a play tonight, but food is important! Come in, Lady Imarris was it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He swept a hand and the [Lady] smiled. She walked over and the Earthers fell forwards. Redit hurried towards the door and closed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oi, Halrac! It's me, Todi, and Jewel and—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The door slammed in front of the Gold-rank adventurer's face. The [Actors] clustered around Maviola. Because they could recognize someone in a similar field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello. Did Maviola say she knew you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ceria looked at Rose. The young woman stared at Ceria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're a half-Elf! Oh—your hand! &lt;em&gt;Look at her arms!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Cryomancer] smiled. Joseph started as Ksmvr turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Ksmvr. Hello, I am not a m—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Look at it. The chaos, the moment. Rose was babbling, trying to communicate something to Jasi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um, I'm a fan. I haven't seen anything, but &lt;em&gt;Pygmalion.&lt;/em&gt; Do you—I mean, how did you learn the play?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We might go to this Riverfarm. I don't know what your team's doing, but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Typhenous was talking to Pisces as the [Necromancer] nodded, distracted. Joseph was trying to get to Rose and pull her back as Ksmvr happily kept talking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have eaten no Humans. And I have killed Humans only in justifiable acts of law enforcement or bounty-hunting—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And in Liscor, a [Mage] burst into the inn from Pallass. Montressa shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin! The door's in Invrisil!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman had a note saying the same thing from the Mage's Guild, delivered by Drassi. She turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No way! &lt;/em&gt;It's there! The Horns are there! Everyone! Where's Numbtongue? Lyonette? &lt;em&gt;Mrsha, the Horns are in Invrisil!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And the Players of Celum! Wesle, Jasi! Emme! Someone grab the door!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Temile leapt off the stage. The [Actors] shouted and poured forwards. And the inn exploded into motion. Mrsha leapt out of the Garden of Sanctuary as Visma peeked out of it. Numbtongue poked his head out of the kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone go tell Relc! And Selys! And Krshia and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"On it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi raced out towards the hallway, gleeful as a [Gossip] could be. Someone swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd better tell the Watch Captain! And the Council!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Beilmark raced after her. The Senior Guardswoman charged out. Erin looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get the door! Get the—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Actors] rushed back into the common room, holding the magical door. Erin saw Lyonette hurrying downstairs with Pawn. And Belgrade and Bird—they'd been making a Fortress of Fluff for Pawn. Nothing untoward. This time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The door to Invrisil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin stood up. He looked around the inn as Erin pointed at the door. Lyonette was shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The ice cream! Get the ice cream, Ishkr! We're going to sell everything!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone get the Halfseekers! In Pallass!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was laughing. She hurried over to the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everyone outta the way! I'm gonna open it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hold on. Everyone's not here yet!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin! &lt;em&gt;Wait!&lt;/em&gt; We need to get ready for the rush! Ishkr, we need all staff here!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Access to Invrisil will change how Pallass sees The Wandering Inn. Erin Solstice—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin was cautioning her. He tried to move forwards and a Gnoll bounced off his head. Grimalkin stared at Mrsha. She crawled over his shoulder and over Temile's head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone get my &lt;em&gt;'No Killing Goblins' &lt;/em&gt;sign! I'm gonna open it! Apparently everyone's &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the Players!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Invrisil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Palt murmured to Montressa. She and Bezale stared as Erin adjusted the dial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too soon. No one was ready! The Council of Liscor exploded out of their seats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stop that insane Human! We need to regulate this!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism roared. Even Krshia was cursing and rushing out the door. Relc threw down his spear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm on &lt;em&gt;duty! &lt;/em&gt;Watch Captain—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get to the inn, Relc!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake brightened. Zevara roared and pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get me a platoon to that inn! Before that [Innkeeper] does something!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They all ran, cursing, laughing, expectant. Liscor's inhabitants flooded after them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Now this is the crazy Human I know. About time!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Gnoll remarked as Selys pushed forwards, through the gates since the magical door was broken. And it was too late to stop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice adjusted the magical mana stones. She threw open the door. She blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whoops, wrong setting. This one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She closed the door, adjusted the dial. The inn roared. Laughter, excitement, a hundred little stories. It all came together. Erin Solstice, the [Innkeeper], chaos, threw open the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Crazy Human of Liscor. And the doorway flickered to life. Another room appeared. And there she was. And no one was prepared for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hello, Invris—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice paused. She blinked. And then she took a step back. The crowd froze. And someone stepped through the doorway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Magnolia Reinhart. She looked at Erin Solstice as the young woman blinked up at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the inn, Redit blinked at the sword Reynold was pointing at his throat. The Players of Celum, the Earthworlders, the adventurers stared as two [Ladies] walked forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Pryde, and Lady Wuvren. Ressa glanced at Imani and nodded once. And they walked through into Liscor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And there she was. Unprepared for. Unlooked for. Lady Magnolia looked around the inn. Every eye fell on her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Deadly Flower Blooming in the North. Magnolia Reinhart, of the Five Families. And she smiled that infuriating smile and looked at the [Innkeeper].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello, Erin Solstice. I've been waiting to meet you again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin gawped at Magnolia. She stuttered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you—the door—wait—wait—!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was too late. Magnolia Reinhart swept forwards. And she was &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the inn. Everyone backed up from the [Lady]. She looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My, it is grander than I thought! But what lovely refurbishment. I'm sensing some Terandrian architecture here. Ressa?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everything looks Terandrian to you. It's a box."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Maid] grumbled. She was glancing around. She looked straight at Grimalkin. The [Sinew Magus] had frozen. He was looking at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the highest-leveled [Ladies] in the world. And behind her came—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pryde.&lt;/em&gt; Erin saw a stylized bob cut, blonde hair with dusky threads shining. Lady Pryde strode through the door. And she was wearing—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A tracksuit? No—yes! She looked like she had just walked out of a model lineup…fifty years ago. Out of some of the 1970's of American fashion. Not just any tracksuit, either. It was made with glossy satin, bright yellow, and gave the impression of authority. The long leggings stretched down to Pryde's shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It fit her. If there was any woman meant for a business suit—or tracksuit, it was Pryde. And next to her—Erin's mouth opened and she lost all words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because Wuvren followed Pryde. And if Pryde was striking, Wuvren was &lt;em&gt;gorgeous.&lt;/em&gt; Her hair had been pulled back, and her makeup had been styled in a modern fashion. &lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt; dress was very modern, revealing her bare shoulders, and it was kept up by a precarious strap around her neck. Her dress had no back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked like a model. And she was the most beautiful woman Erin had ever seen, bar none. The young woman stared. Then she realized—Magnolia was also wearing a rather unique style of dress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course, she was wearing pink. More rose in color. She had a wide-brimmed hat, and a—business-like dress. As in, someone from the business world might wear it. Maybe not in that shade of pink, but it was a jacket-like top and skirt, not a &lt;em&gt;dress&lt;/em&gt; like most [Ladies] wore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they wore dresses, not—this. This was Earth's fashion. Erin blinked at Magnolia. So did everyone else. Even their haircuts were minded in Earth's fashion, not the styles of Terandria today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia had kept her hair long and free-flowing, but Pryde had consented to her cut, and Wuvren had done the same with the braiding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. What is—I mean—Magnolia?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady]'s eyes twinkled. She adjusted her hat as Ressa stepped past her, dressed as the Victorian-era [Maid] as usual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin, it is a&lt;em&gt; delight &lt;/em&gt;to see you again. I hope you'll pardon the intrusion, but I've heard &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; about the door to Liscor. And if you don't mind—I've brought some of my closest friends. May I introduce you to Lady Pryde and Lady Wuvren."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Charmed.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren smiled at Erin. And the [Innkeeper]'s heart skipped a beat. Ishkr stared and someone sighed from the crowd—Wuvren was the [Eternal Beauty] and everyone fell in love with her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So this is the inn? Hm. So much to do over such a small place. And we're in Liscor, are we? That's decent magic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde looked around. Her eyes flashed towards the Antinium. And her face froze. Magnolia nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We are in Liscor. Oh! It is something, to see all of this and not hear about it. Is this the [Grand Theater]? How nice! Although—I think the Season Theatre might be bigger at this point. And this must be little Mrsha!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All three [Ladies] looked down. A white Gnoll stared up at them, blinking. Wuvren blinked. And her intoxicating charm turned into genuine delight. Erin blinked. She looked like she was in her thirties now. Not the young woman who had just been there a moment ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, what a beautiful child!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha bashfully retreated. No one had ever called her &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; before. Lady Magnolia smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wuvren, you'll have more time to spoil Gnoll children later. We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on a timer. But—ah, hello!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A claw pushed a staring Temile and half a dozen [Actors] out of the way. Grimalkin looked at Magnolia Reinhart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Reinhart. I am Grimalkin of Pallass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, [Sinew Magus]! How delightful. I was hoping to meet with you—briefly. Do excuse me for my sudden interruption. I won't be troubling the inn long. Reynold? Where's our guest?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia smiled. Grimalkin gazed at her, and flicked his eyes towards Ressa. She was watching &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, as well as looking around the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Reinhart. Your presence in Liscor is exactly what I should have been prepared for. May I respectfully ask that you return to your door until I notify Pallass' High Command?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You may."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia didn't budge. Grimalkin's brows drew together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm afraid I must insist."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He reached out. Ressa barred his path. And so did—Pryde. She sized up the giant Drake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are the largest Drake I've met. I am &lt;em&gt;Pryde.&lt;/em&gt; And one does not insist anything of me. Kindly step back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm afraid I cannot do that. Lady Pryde."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin reached for her shoulder. And his claw &lt;em&gt;jerked&lt;/em&gt; downwards. Pryde smiled coolly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Allow me to rephrase myself. You cannot insist."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Pride is Weight]. Grimalkin's muscles &lt;em&gt;bulged&lt;/em&gt; and the [Sinew Magus] withdrew his hand with a grimace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gravity Skill. I would prefer to keep this civil. Whatever you are planning—I—am—&lt;em&gt;here.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He reached out. At first his hand &lt;em&gt;jerked&lt;/em&gt; as Pryde's aura dragged it down. Then Erin saw the scales and flesh &lt;em&gt;twist&lt;/em&gt;. But Grimalkin murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Lion's Strength]. [Stoneskin]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Half a dozen spells. He reached out and Erin swore she heard his bones &lt;em&gt;creaking&lt;/em&gt;. Lightly, he moved Pryde back a step.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She blinked. Wuvren and Magnolia watched. Magnolia smiled and Wuvren laughed in delight. Pryde glanced at Grimalkin's arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not bad. But you cannot &lt;em&gt;stop—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pryde, don't antagonize Magus Grimalkin. And Magus—we aren't here for any action that would harm Pallass or Liscor. I would swear on a truth spell. In fact, if you have one…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake flicked his gaze to Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nevertheless, I cannot—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, you. Please allow us just a &lt;em&gt;moment.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren sighed. She blew a kiss. Erin swore she saw something flying at Grimalkin. The [Sinew Magus] jerked back. Too late. He blinked. Stepped back, and bowed slightly. And his voice was suddenly polite, formal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. My apologies, Lady Wuvren."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren laughed and patted him on one arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I do apologize, but it really is in the best of all our interests. We are bound by hospitality's rules. Pryde?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grimalkin. Hmf."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] walked past Grimalkin. The [Sinew Magus] stood there, calmly. Then his jaw began to twitch. Erin saw something pulsing at his temple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Damn.&lt;/em&gt; Formality Skills—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned his head slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stop them.&lt;/em&gt; Warn Saliss. Chaldion—no, wait. I can do that. Just not interfere—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He put a claw to his temple, and his eyes flickered. Erin looked at Magnolia. She was arguing with someone on Invrisil's side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reynold, what's the hold up?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He was beating a man with his staff. Lady Reinhart—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For &lt;em&gt;what? &lt;/em&gt;Abusing his dog? Well then, arrest the fellow and we'll sort it out later. Nalthaliarstrelous, I told you—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I'm coming.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A figure stomped through the crowd. Erin saw an old man—or plant. His beard was not, like Typhenous' neatly combed. And the [Druid] was either younger or kept younger by his class. It was a tangled mess, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And his clothing! It was ragged, stained with old soil and dirt. Not &lt;em&gt;filthy&lt;/em&gt;, just not like the [Butler]'s immaculate costume. And the Druid gave off a similar odor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He wasn't stinky. Just earthen. He walked with the long, curved staff. And Erin saw the staff was still growing. Buds of flowers and leaves grew from it. Also—there was a bit of blood on the bottom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. Portal door?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Druid] poked at the edge of the boundary with a staff. He glanced at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As I said, Nalthaliarstrelous. &lt;em&gt;May&lt;/em&gt; I call you Nathal?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. This feels like….Liscor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Again, as I said. Won't you indulge us? This entire affair falls apart without you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Druid] crossed his arms. He didn't seem to care. He glanced at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who're you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hi, I'm Erin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Erin could think to say. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; was on the wrong-foot here. And more—she was being overpowered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside her inn.&lt;/em&gt; But the three [Ladies] were quite literally forcing Erin backwards. Erin could feel it—especially Wuvren. She felt compelled not to speak, or interrupt the scene. She was fighting, but it was three versus one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Innkeeper]. Hm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Druid] glanced about. Then his eyes brightened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A &lt;em&gt;garden.&lt;/em&gt; Here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He walked through the doorway. He passed by Erin and looked around. His eyes found the Garden of Sanctuary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ah.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He hurried into it. Erin gaped. He'd just gone into her Garden! Magnolia &lt;em&gt;tsked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh dear. I should have predicted—Ressa, fetch him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Maid] hurried after Nalthaliarstrelous. She ran &lt;em&gt;smack&lt;/em&gt; into the doorway. The open air blocked Ressa as she pushed against it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia &lt;em&gt;snickered&lt;/em&gt;. She covered her mouth as Ressa looked back at her. Then both of them looked at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Solstice? If you'd allow Ressa a moment? We really do have a schedule to keep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are you here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was trembling. She saw Ceria gaping. Mouthing Magnolia's name. But everyone was &lt;em&gt;stuck&lt;/em&gt;. Magnolia sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It would be hard to explain. Oh well. We have ways. Excuse me? Little Gnoll? Mrsha?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bent down. Mrsha stared at Magnolia as the woman smiled at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Would you mind fetching Nalthaliarstrelous? &lt;span style="color: rgba(253, 120, 255, 1)"&gt;Please?&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin heard the [Charm] in the voice. She glowered. Mrsha blinked a few times. She walked towards the door—and someone scooped her up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll do it. Excuse me, Erin. Lady Reinhart."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette patted Mrsha on the head. She turned her head. Magnolia Reinhart met Lyonette's eyes. The [Princess] curtsied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh? And you are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart touched the tip of her hat. She regarded Lyonette levelly. The [Princess] was breathing hard, but she was moving. She bowed deeply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am the [Barmaid] in charge of The Wandering Inn. May I serve you [Ladies]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. I believe so. Our [Druid] has invaded the garden. I would quite like him back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course, Lady Reinhart."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] turned. Magnolia raised a finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah—but before you do. Might I ask, Miss…[Barmaid]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette froze. Her shoulders hunched. And she turned with a friendly smile on her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lady Reinhart?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] regarded her as Ressa stepped back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you enjoy it, working here? I ask just out of curiosity."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman hesitated. Then she curtsied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, milady. Quite a lot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia smiled. And she dipped her hat in a gracious nod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All well and good, then. If you could fetch Nalthaliarstrelous? And do use his name. He's peculiar about that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette hurried through the door. Erin heard her raised voice. But the action was &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;By order of the Watch! Stop that [Innkeeper] until—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara charged into the inn with a squad of [Guards] and Liscor's Council. They stopped, as all three [Ladies] turned to them. Magnolia Reinhart opened her hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, and this must be Liscor's esteemed Council! Do pardon me. I am Lady Reinhart. I couldn't help but visit your wonderful little city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Magnolia Reinhart?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The name began to echo around the crowd. Erin saw a few people, like Drassi, looking confused. But the older inhabitants of Liscor started at the name. Lism, wheezing, leaned on the doorframe as Krshia's eyes went wide with shock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. &lt;em&gt;Her.&lt;/em&gt; That busybody?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the rest of the adults stared at Magnolia, with awe. And Erin remembered—Magnolia had led the first defense of the city against the Antinium, breaking their siege long ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;History. Watch Captain Zevara &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at Magnolia Reinhart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A [Lady] from the north is…may I ask why you're here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just on a small errand. Watch Captain Zevara, I believe?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—know my name?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course! Pryde, &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; are you so fascinated by?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady of Pride] had ducked into the inn and was looking around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There's a Hobgoblin over there. Also—there's a room full of objects. Those weights you mentioned."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, yes. You can investigate &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;. Wuvren?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Eternal Beauty] was standing to the side. She turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just investigating, Magnolia. It was good to meet you…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Belgrade. You are very beautiful. Goodbye."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Tactician] stared after Wuvren. The two [Ladies] returned as Magnolia sighed. But—there came a figure. Nalthaliarstrelous didn't stomp or curse in the Garden of Sanctuary. He emerged, looking thoughtful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good plants. Young place. Why'd you pull me out?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He glowered at the [Lady]. She opened her mouth and Nalthaliarstrelous turned away. He gazed around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm? &lt;em&gt;Hm?&lt;/em&gt; Where are you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He peered around, suddenly, frowning. The [Druid] stared under a table. Then he whirled. And met a little Gnoll's eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha stared up at the [Druid]. Nalthaliarstrelous bent down. He stared, and his aggressive features—softened for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You? Well met, little landfriend. You're untaught, aren't you? Strange. Is this your place?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded, solemnly. The [Druid], still ignoring Magnolia, straightened. He swept her a formal bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My apologies for intruding. 'Tis good land. Wondrous, terrible flowers. I am on my duties. Until then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded to Mrsha. And she nodded back. Then, Nalthaliarstrelous turned. He looked at Magnolia. And suddenly, he was focused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's go, then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart sighed in relief. She nodded to Ressa, and Pryde and Wuvren.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe the door takes us to Liscor. Ressa? Reynold?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Maid] closed the door as the [Butler] stepped through. Erin saw them shut the door—at the last moment, the [Ladies] let go and she heard the exclamations from the other side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What the hell is happ—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then the door closed. Ressa adjusted the dial to Liscor, and opened it. Magnolia Reinhart sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How &lt;em&gt;useful.&lt;/em&gt; Come, [Ladies]. And Liscor's Council, Watch Captain, if you'd be so kind? Nalthaliarstrelous, lead the way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hmf. All stone. &lt;em&gt;Disgusting. &lt;/em&gt;And there's something beneath. Damn Drakes, messing up the land and burying damned dungeons all over the place…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Druid] stomped through. Magnolia nodded, and Reynold and Ressa followed. Then she, Pryde, and Wuvren walked through. Erin felt the pressure on her release. She sat back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Wh—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"After her!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism shouted. The Council and Watch charged through. Erin sat on the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Wh—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is a &lt;em&gt;disaster!&lt;/em&gt; But she didn't bring an attack force. Why did she come here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin growled. Ishkr started and looked alarmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The book?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A few of the Gnolls in the crowd groaned. Mrsha looked up, alarmed. She ran through the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mrsha!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette ran after her. Erin sat there, as most of the inn ran after Magnolia. She looked at Grimalkin. He gazed down at her. Erin raised one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This one wasn't my fault."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sinew Magus] gave her an uncharacteristically alarmed and sympathetic look. He nodded, and folded his arms. His legs &lt;em&gt;twitched&lt;/em&gt;, but he couldn't walk through the door. After a moment, he growled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. But at least now you know how it feels."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin caught herself nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart walked through Liscor. Through a storm of questions, through crowds of people. And her name was on every lip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magnolia Reinhart. &lt;/em&gt;The savior of the city, long ago. But her presence here was like a lightning bolt. Before any emotion could be had, people had to get over the shock. And it was a physical thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But some of them were fast on their feet. Some had sworn an oath to protect this city. Some had the will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lady Reinhart! Please halt!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara barred the way as Magnolia walked towards one of the staircases leading up to the ramparts. Instantly, Pryde pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One side. We don't have all the time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara stepped to one side. The Drake blinked in outrage, but she kept pace with Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Reinhart, what are you &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; in my city, may I ask?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady]'s Skills were even forcing her to formality in speech. Magnolia nodded at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am just taking a short visit, Watch Captain. I can assure you, this is meant in all aid to Liscor. You have my word as a [Lady] on it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Somehow, that reassured Zevara. Because it was part of the very Skill that bound her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even so, Lady Reinhart—I must protest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"By all means. I'm aware how irregular this is. Ah, the Council. Hello. Are you…Lism? I have heard so much about you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake thrust his way forwards. He was gritting his teeth, jaw clenched to fight his way past the invisible field around Magnolia and the two [Ladies].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm Councilmember Lism of Liscor. And this is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Krshia pushed Lism to one side. She was panting too, but she followed Magnolia as the woman walked up the stairs. Pryde had already strode past the others thanks to her mobile tracksuit and was staring off the battlements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Councilmembers, I am delighted to meet you. And again, I apologize. But you really will see that my intentions are good. Nalthaliarstrelous?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm doing it. Go. Away."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Druid] was standing in the street, not with the [Ladies]. He'd planted his staff into the street by smashing through a cobblestone. He closed his eyes. Magnolia nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then—Reynold? Escort one of the [Mages] up here. Preferably Miss du Valeross"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was on the battlements. Lism was drawing breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You are violating Liscor's laws! There are no civilians allowed on the walls, much less foreigners! I demand to know what you're doing and—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Silence. Thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lism recoiled and clawed at his mouth. Magnolia saw Montressa being escorted up the stairs by Reynold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Miss Montressa. I think we've actually met. I visited the du Valeross estates about twelve years back. Hello, how do you do?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"L-Lady Reinhart? I am Montressa—I mean—hello. How can I help you? And why are you…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa stared wide-eyed at Magnolia. The [Lady] sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All questions will be answered. Would you kindly cast a [Scrying] spell to Wistram? I'm sure you've already informed them I'm here. If they're waiting, please connect me. Onto that new television network."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;How did she &lt;em&gt;know?&lt;/em&gt; But it was all cause and effect. Of course, Palt and Beza and Montressa had been screaming the news. But how had Magnolia known they were &lt;em&gt;here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But there was nothing for it. Wistram was &lt;em&gt;screaming &lt;/em&gt;at her for a broadcast anyways. The [Aegiscaster] slowly raised a finger to her temple. Her eyes unfocused and then she felt part of her consciousness fade away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Scrying]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you. Ah, Reynold, the scrying orb?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Butler] produced it. Magnolia stared into the blank orb. So did everyone else. Pryde edged over and gently…shoved Magnolia to one side. Wuvren took up the background. And then—there was an image of Magnolia Reinhart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Just her. No Noass—or anyone else. The broadcast had cut off and Magnolia had appeared. The Floodplains were at her back. Well, Pryde was in the way. Then Magnolia gently shoved her aside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was the [Lady]. People began to tune in. The King of Destruction, idly watching and not understanding all the nuances. Terandrian royalty. But most importantly—the Walled Cities. Pallass especially.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And [Lords] and [Ladies]. Ieka Imarris choked as she saw the image. Maviola, standing in the inn with the Horns and Players of Celum, gazed at Magnolia Reinhart's face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Tyrion Veltras saw Magnolia smiling at him. His gut clenched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart spoke to her audience, which was really Montressa, as if she was used to the idea of a camera. She adjusted her hat. And then nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good evening to you all. I am Magnolia Reinhart. And I have your attention."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] looked about, and laughed a bit to herself. Self-consciously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My, I didn't plan this part out at all. Well—to begin, I'm in Liscor. On the walls, with Lady Pryde and Wuvren. Wave for the people, Pryde."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The view moved. Magnolia stepped to one side, and the viewers saw the city from above. Magnolia spoke, and everyone could see the staring Drakes and Gnolls, gazing up at her. Watch Captain Zevara and the Council were frozen in the background.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Liscor. It is quite a lovely place. I feel privileged to stand on the walls. Rather than see it damaged."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at the audience. Straight at Tyrion Veltras. Standing on the walls of Liscor. The [Lord]'s hand &lt;em&gt;cracked &lt;/em&gt;the scrying orb as he stared at her. Magnolia went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But I don't mean to harp. I only asked for a bit of attention at this moment to make a small speech. Something about alliances. Here—we have Liscor's Council. Councilmembers Krshia and Lism, I believe. And the stalwart, fiery, I daresay, Watch Captain Zevara."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drakes and Gnoll started. Lism looked at the scrying orb, saw himself in it, and gave the worst smile to the scrying orb. Krshia did the same. Magnolia's was more realistic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I was just saying how delighted I was to visit Liscor. And it is a rather unique thing, a Human coming to this city. But Liscor is…an important place. It marks the boundary between south and north. And it is also where Drakes and Gnolls and Humans fought. Against a common foe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked across Liscor. Something was moving. A thread of black bodies and a blue one. Magnolia smiled tightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Necromancer. Ah! I mean, the Antinium of course. Well, both. But the Antinium are the living ones, aren't they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She chuckled. Az'kerash stared at her face. So did Ilvriss. Magnolia Reinhart went on, and the viewers saw something moving in the streets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is a curious thing. War. And I realize the north and south are traditionally opposed. However—there are some things I think we can agree on. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. But I really just wanted to attract some attention. Naughty of me, I suppose. But look—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed. And everyone in the world turned and saw the Antinium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They marched down the street. A flood of Antinium. Black-bodied Workers, Soldiers. And more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn the Small Queen strode forwards with Klbkch. And there was Pivr. Xeu. Tersk and Dekass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And they did not know they were being watched.&lt;/em&gt; Lism recoiled as he saw Flying Antinium, stalking Silent Antinium. Armored Antinium and Painted Antinium. Magnolia's eyes glittered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ancestors! What are those Antinium &lt;em&gt;doing?&lt;/em&gt; Those aren't the Free Antinium!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zevara made a strangled sound. She hadn't seen the other Antinium. Magnolia didn't look surprised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe they're from other Hives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Every head turned towards her. Watch Captain Zevara caught herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—we didn't see them. And we've kept a lookout—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her scales turned white. And Magnolia Reinhart's eyes glittered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Imagine that. Pryde, as I recall, your House fought in both Antinium Wars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. And excuse me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde walked down the battlements. The [Lady] was staring at the Small Queen. But Xrn wasn't focused on her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You! Stop! Enough!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She shouted. At a figure standing in the street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nalthaliarstrelous. The [Druid] ignored her. His eyes were closed, but there was no sign of what he was doing. At least—obviously. Xrn pointed her staff at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde barred Xrn's way. The Small Queen saw the Lady Ulta standing in front of her. And two figures flanked Pryde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ressa and Reynold. The Antinium halted. And Magnolia spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Small Queen of the Antinium. Good evening to you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn looked up. And her eyes fixed on Montressa, the scrying orb. Klbkch made a sound next to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Kvetch. &lt;/em&gt;That is not good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You. Are Magnolia Reinhart. Call off that spellcaster. Now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen spoke flatly. Magnolia looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I have never met you, myself. But then I never fought on the front lines. Xrn, I believe your name is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen raised her staff. Looking at Nalthaliarstrelous. The [Druid] was unmoving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop him. Or I will do it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That. Would be war. And I would take that as a personal affront if you &lt;em&gt;tried.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] looked down at Xrn. The Small Queen hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why are you &lt;em&gt;here?&lt;/em&gt; We bear you no specific enmity. Nor you us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True. It is nothing personal. But that makes us the best sort of enemies. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in only one thing. And that is &lt;em&gt;unity&lt;/em&gt;. I am a [Lady] of Izril. And before politics, before species. I believe we do not stand alone. When an enemy comes, Izril repels it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart looked down at the Antinium. And they gazed up at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;What was the point? Of any of it? To denounce the Antinium? No—show that they were in Liscor? How had she known? But the last piece of puzzle was this. Magnolia waved a hand in Montressa's face as Nalthaliarstrelous's head rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How do you turn her off? Excuse me—I'm done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa blinked. Lism started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What did she say?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a universal question. But Magnolia Reinhart was snapping her fingers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me, would you mind cutting the spell? I'm quite done. And this distraction is fin—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Scrying] spell cut out. And that was it. There was only silence, as Magnolia turned to Wuvren.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Go first. I'll go last."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Eternal Beauty] was looking down at Klbkch and Xrn. Magnolia strode down the steps. The air was &lt;em&gt;humming&lt;/em&gt; between Pryde and Xrn. The [Lady] looked away as Ressa and Reynold backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nalthaliarstrelous?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Druid] was panting. He nodded to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have it. Not all that lies beneath. That dungeon—it's vast. But I have it. Tunnels. You're right. There's a damn one going south. Big. And all the numbers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The…Klbkch's mouth opened. He looked at Xrn. And the Small Queen's anxiety made sense. The [Druid] looked at the Antinium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Counted &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them too. Some are higher level. Most're the same. Here's the numbers. I'll do the map later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He scribbled down on a piece of paper Ressa produced, with a quill. Magnolia studied the first one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How. &lt;em&gt;Interesting.&lt;/em&gt; Nalthaliarstrelous, you are a treasure. And with that, our work is done. Watch Captain, Council. Miss Xrn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have made an error."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen stared at Magnolia. Her staff was glowing. But Wuvren took Pryde's place. The [Lady of Pryde] looked at Wuvren.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll go last. Pryde, don't be stubborn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde retreated. Wuvren blew a kiss. It went through Klbkch and nothing happened. Her face fell slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not even a bit?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia was walking back towards the door as Reynold helped Nalthaliarstrelous. He looked tired, from the life-sensing spell. Because that was what a [Druid] did. And of course, they could sense things like nature. Like…tunnels in the earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Klbkch ignored Wuvren. He put one hand on his sword and looked at Xrn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do we stop them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You may try. But that would be war. And you're surrounded."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia called out cheerfully. The Antinium looked around. At the crowds. At Watch Captain Zevara, who had suddenly put herself in their way. The Watch Captain looked at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That number—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I plan on sharing it. And I will of course have Nalthaliarstrelous copy the map."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hate maps."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Druid] growled. They walked through the door. And the Antinium just watched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice saw Magnolia Reinhart enter the inn, then Ressa and Reynold and Nalthaliarstrelous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then Pryde. Wuvren was last. Warily backing up. And Erin just looked at Magnolia. Just—looked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What have you done?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What matters, Miss Solstice. I hope you'll forgive me. But even if not—Ressa? Our next destination."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia turned. And Ressa was adjusting the door. Erin saw a glowing yellow stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pallass&lt;/em&gt;. And it all came together. Erin reached out and Pryde and Wuvren blocked her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop. Please. They're not—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Grimalkin caught Erin's arm. Gently. And Magnolia Reinhart walked through the doorway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In Pallass, the Drakes and Gnolls on duty stared at her. And Lady Magnolia spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Lady Magnolia Reinhart. I would like to speak to Grand Strategist Chaldion, please."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They hesitated. The other [Ladies] and servants walked through. Nalthaliarstrelous walked back towards Erin's garden. [Sergeant] Kel looked at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And whatever he thought about Erin, Lady Chaos, whatever you wanted to call her—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Here was an actual [Lady]. And a City Runner stormed into the checkpoint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sergeant Kel! Immediate orders!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sergeant] read. The gate rose instantly. And Magnolia Reinhart walked forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have orders to escort you to Grand Strategist Chaldion &lt;em&gt;at once.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Watch informed the [Lady]. She nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she entered Pallass. Magnolia Reinhart stepped along the street. Drakes and Gnolls looked up as she walked. Pryde and Wuvren fell in behind her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The last time a Reinhart walked on Pallass' walls was nearly six hundred years ago. And that was to be executed after capture in battle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart spoke lightly. She followed Kel, pausing as she walked along the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Floor. And Pallass looked up at her. A [Lady], dressed in a new style.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ressa, my documents. Also—how do I look?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dressed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Maid] was glancing around tightly. She had a manila folder. Magnolia accepted it. Pryde paused on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not a bad city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked down her nose at the city. The embodiment of a deadly sin. Or a virtue for Drakes. Wuvren blew a kiss as she walked and broke ten thousand hearts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Charm and pride and…Magnolia saw a figure being carried towards her. Chaldion himself was sitting up in his bed. The Lady Reinhart stopped, in clear view of everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grand Strategist, I would have come to you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Save it. That—show me what you found. Did you just &lt;em&gt;detect&lt;/em&gt; the exact count of Antinium in Liscor? Magus Grimalkin says there's a tunnel—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Chaldion was reaching for the piece of paper. Magnolia offered it to him. He read, cursed, and read again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Completely accurate. Nalthaliarstrelous is a high-level [Druid]. I hope you'll copy this information to the other Walled Cities, and Liscor of course. Also—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia's next words were drowned out by a cheer. People were pointing up at her. And word was spreading. Grimalkin paused, staring at the [Ladies]. And now it was becoming clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An &lt;em&gt;ally.&lt;/em&gt; Chaldion blinked with his good eye at Magnolia. He glanced over the side of the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drakes and Gnolls and Garuda and Dullahans were cheering. Calling Magnolia's name. Not all of them. A minority in fact. But some remembered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;During the First Antinium War, Magnolia Reinhart led the defense of Izril against the Antinium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was a page from a history book. And they remembered it now. The [Lady] waved a hand, and the people cheered. More were looking at Pryde's dress, or Wuvren's style.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wistram had reinstated the scrying spell. It was zooming in on the three [Ladies]. All adorned in unique fashion. Someone in Wistram was having a fit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Lady Magnolia? She looked at Chaldion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hope you can appreciate the moment, Strategist Chaldion. It took some doing. I have a few more gifts as well. This would be for your [Engineers]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She offered him a page. The [Grand Strategist] looked at a diagram of a gear. A system of pullies…he looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is the elevator. And this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Moving floors. Escalators. I'd be happy to discuss it more. I have a few more notes, but this is goodwill."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] looked at the Drake. His good eye narrowed. She had taken more than just dresses from her guests. Information. All that mattered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're putting all your eggs in one basket, Lady Reinhart. Why &lt;em&gt;now?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. I hope you'll attend a…little party in Oteslia in the near future, Grand Strategist. As for why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart turned her head. She lifted her hat and smiled down at the people of Pallass. And they shouted her name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Reinhart! Magnolia Reinhart!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Cheering for her. A member of the Five Families. What madness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Onieva, looking up, sighed longingly at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ancestors. What a &lt;em&gt;presence. &lt;/em&gt;And that dress."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mirn gazed up at Magnolia's stylized dress. At Pyrde, Wuvren. The [Protector] spoke longingly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Especially that &lt;em&gt;dress&lt;/em&gt;. What style is that? I need it. Onieva, go up there and strip them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia glanced at Chaldion as the cheering went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Humans should not be alone. How long have our species fought? Consider this a gift, Grand Strategist. And think on my words? We have bigger enemies than each other."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake eyed Magnolia. But he nodded. And Magnolia Reinhart turned. She waved once, and left. And chaos? She turned a Walled City on its head. And perhaps only the old Drake heard Magnolia murmur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Besides. I owe Zel Shivertail this, at least."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Chaldion looked at her back. And he half-rose, ignoring the [Healer] and his bodyguards. And he wanted to believe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice sat in her inn. Liscor and Pallass were ringing with Magnolia Reinhart's name. The Antinium had retreated to their Hive. And Erin stood up as the three [Ladies] returned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That will be all. A success. Pryde, Wuvren, thank you ever so much for your help. Let's reconvene tonight. I should have a fair amount of [Messages], but I will be free to attend this play."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The door to Invrisil was opened. Pryde and Wuvren walked through. The Players of Celum parted as the [Ladies] walked past them, talking. And Magnolia watched as Reynold led a grumbling Nalthaliarstrelous through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And no one stopped her. Grimalkin had &lt;em&gt;helped&lt;/em&gt; her, when he'd figured it out. Magnolia Reinhart sighed. She fanned at her brow; she allowed herself to sweat lightly only now. In relief. She turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Minotaur Punch]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A fist flew at her face. Ressa caught Erin and the [Innkeeper] staggered as the momentum of her fist stopped. She strained, but Ressa had her neck in a hold—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ressa, stop that. Miss Erin is quite upset. As she should be."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin &lt;em&gt;breathed&lt;/em&gt; as Ressa let go. The [Innkeeper] staggered back. Magnolia waved at the doorway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everyone, stand back please. I will be returning to Invrisil in a moment. But I think this is a private conversation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone else shuffled back. But Erin and Magnolia stood in the young woman's inn, in a circle of silence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—you ruined it. They didn't do&lt;em&gt; anything.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin pointed at Magnolia with a shaking finger. The [Lady] looked at her, calmly, coldly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"On the contrary. I haven't &lt;em&gt;'done' &lt;/em&gt;anything other than make Pallass and the Walled Cities wary. As they should be. Or were &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; aware that multiple breeds of Antinium were in Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] opened her mouth. She bit her tongue. Xrn had hinted, but Erin hadn't realized—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some of them are &lt;em&gt;good.&lt;/em&gt; The Antinium! How could you just walk in and—do that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It had felt like all three [Ladies] had just &lt;em&gt;squished&lt;/em&gt; her against the floorboards. She hadn't been able to do anything. &lt;em&gt;In her own inn.&lt;/em&gt; Magnolia's eyes were sympathetic. But cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Erin Solstice. Drakes and Humans have torn each other apart for countless generations. I made an overture, of goodwill. Did I step on your toes to do so? &lt;em&gt;Yes.&lt;/em&gt; And I will be called &lt;em&gt;traitor&lt;/em&gt; by some of my peers. But this may lead to peace in a war as old as my &lt;em&gt;House.&lt;/em&gt; Consider that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin opened and closed her mouth. Ressa was standing next to her. Erin made a fist—and then just shook it at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just—just answer me this. Do you know what you did? &lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt; If they die—I'll never forgive you. Do you have any idea? Or is this just politics? Is it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Erin Solstice.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart snapped. Erin fell silent. And Magnolia looked around. At the inn. At all the people whose names she'd known without ever having met them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She glanced through the doorway, at the Players of Celum, whom she was going to watch that very night. And at the Earthworlders. Some were hiding behind the tables. But Magnolia just looked back at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My dear Erin Solstice, I know exactly who my enemies are. And I watch young women like you. Yes, I know what I've done. I planned it. The only part I didn't account for was the &lt;em&gt;eggs.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Eggs…? What eggs?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin whispered. Magnolia shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will remand Rose and the others into your care, since Miss Griffin seemed so insistent on it. Do you know where she is? Reizmelt, or the area thereabouts. I apologize, again, Erin. That is all I can truly say."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded and turned away. Erin whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hate you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] walked through the doorway. Ressa followed, sparing Erin a look. Magnolia sighed as she walked out of the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Another one on a rather long list. A shame. But she shouldn't forgive me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely not. That was an incredibly underhanded move. Milady."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ressa opened the door to the carriage. Magnolia gave her a reproving look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And would you have done otherwise? I didn't hear you gainsaying any plans."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Maid] settled herself into the coach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely not. Better to try this than war. But don't expect Erin Solstice to ever forgive you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pryde had already walked off, but Wuvren was sitting in the coach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My feet hurt. Did that young woman have words for you? She was &lt;em&gt;strong.&lt;/em&gt; I didn't believe you when you said you feared you might not be able to suppress her, Magnolia."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] smiled thinly as the carriage began to move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I told you she was significant, Wuvren. I fear she hates me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"With good reason."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, shut up, Ressa."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Wuvren smiled. She was older now, closer to her actual age. She looked thoughtfully out of the window as the coach pulled away. Nalthaliarstrelous was riding on the roof, closer to nature. And because he smelled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She was something. She has a number of charm-related Skills. [Crowd Control], I think. She doesn't control it. I can see how she could start a riot if she wanted to, especially if it began in her inn. Why did you feature Liscor in that scrying broadcast?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because it's not war &lt;em&gt;yet.&lt;/em&gt; And either way—the city could grow. Invrisil, Liscor, Pallass—Wuvren. I should like it so very much to be the case that the Antinium are changing. That we can ally with the Drakes and deal with…unpleasant people. But if that is not the case? Liscor will not fall easily."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia's eyes flashed in the darkness. Wuvren just nodded. And they rode away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The end. Chaos had hit. The [Lady] had come and gone. And no one had been prepared for her. But—the door to Liscor was open. And timidly, slowly, the Horns of Hammerad entered the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman was resting her head on a table. But her friends were there. And a group started at her name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She didn't go after us. But she &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose looked at Joseph. Imani just stared at the magical doorway. She didn't know what had happened, not all the details. But she heard the name. And she saw a familiar face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's here. The Wandering Inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The group from Earth stared into the inn. Amid Magnolia Reinhart's splendid chaos. Montressa du Valeross looked up as the Earthers followed the Horns into the inn. So did Palt, blinking as Griffon Hunt followed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Change. A growing flower of trust between the north and south. A blow against Antinium plans. Was it good or evil that had been done? One thing was for sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How inelegant. How—rude. She is the rudest [Lady]. But the Reinharts are. She could have lit a flame. But the Deadly Flower of the North just pricks with her thorns."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El scowled after Magnolia. She had disapproved of all of it. But her head turned back to the inn. And inside it, the doorway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pure magic.&lt;/em&gt; A bridge from north to south. And Magnolia's first thought had been to sabatoge the Antinium. That was a Reinhart for you. But look—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It called to her. Maviola El stared into Liscor. And she felt it. In her chest. In the inn itself. It burned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire. &lt;/em&gt;Her heart beat in her chest. And the [Lady] smiled. She walked, almost stumbling towards the door. That young woman had the fire. More than that. A living &lt;em&gt;spark,&lt;/em&gt; as strong as Maviola had ever seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But she was inexperienced. That was why she'd been faltered. But she could learn. Grow. The door called to Maviola. One last time. One last—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aha! I have it back, you [Thief]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone shouted in her ear. Maviola whirled. A [Lady] was riding past her. Bethal Walchaís, laughing merrily, was atop her bareback mare. She galloped past Maviola, raising a finger. Maviola blinked. Bethal rode off through the streets, triumphant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And a figure—Maviola turned and saw a [Chevalier]. Thomast. He looked apologetic as he bowed to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Apologies, Lady El. My wife thinks it would be a merry prank for a day or two. I will ensure it is returned. But Bethal claims it is part of youth."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you…Thomast? Her husband?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola blinked. And then looked at Thomast. The man bowed, with a regretful smile. Handsome—a [Fencer] with a silver bell. Some [Ladies] had all the luck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bethal insists on fair turnabout. I apologize, again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Firestarter grinned. And her eyes lit up, like burning embers, beautifully orange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I stole the horse from her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Thomast coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is not what I meant, Milady. But Bethal was insistent. I hope you will cope with the loss. It may prove to be…eventful. I did meet Bethal under a similar situation. I apologize again, but Bethal knows how to live, if anyone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The words were very confusing. But Maviola was also drawn to Thomast. And Bethal glanced back as she stopped her horse. In sudden, abrupt paranoia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Thomast! Hurry up!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Chevalier] bowed and walked away. And Maviola? She blinked and realized something. Thomast had been her type. And that was the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Charming young men. Well—youngish. The suave ones stole more than just your heart for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He took my money pouch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stared after Thomast and Bethal. But they were already gone. Maviola had her bag of holding, her three vials. And nothing else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But that was fine. She looked at the magical door. And Liscor was changed. But—here. Maviola walked forwards, smiling. She saw Grev dash through, calling Erin's name. And Maviola walked forwards, into the inn. Into—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Into a wall. The [Lady] bounced off the inn's wall. She stared at the blank door. She opened and closed the door a few times. Nothing happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—damn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">492530</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 01:17:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - 7.19</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/491048</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yerra?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The question lingered. And that moment, the culmination of an adventure at sea, and the powers that claimed they ruled the waves clashing—all of it ended. Or took an interlude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Until the next time the world deemed the events worthy of notice. And many who heard the question, whether directly from the scrying orb broadcasting &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; from the decks of a Drake ship, or thereafter—reacted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil's sister, Talia, and his family. Yerranola's family and fellow Selphids. The students of Niers Astoragon's class and the Titan himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So many more. But on another day in the summer, someone who didn't listen and had no idea that there were [Strategists] at sea sat in her inn. And she had a different kind of thought that had nothing to do with poison or Selphids or the ocean—well, one thing was related, at least.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think today I'll try brewing some alcohol. I mean. I can. And that's how alcohol works. Brewing, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin looked at Lyonette for confirmation. The [Worldly Princess] raised her head; she was reading something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How much of a profit should I expect? Also—do it in the basement."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman scowled at Lyonette as the papers rose. Not your traditional book, but a cheaper, rather less sturdy substitute. But it could hold ink and someone had carefully scrawled on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pallassian Times.&lt;/em&gt; It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; familiar. Palt had brought a copy into the inn. And it was, to Erin's knowledge, a written and curated account of worldwide events. The [Innkeeper] hadn't read it; Lyonette had hogged it. Along with Drassi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wow. There was a battle at sea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin read from the back of the newspaper. Lyonette glanced over it and scowled. Somehow, she had managed to emulate the classic newspaper look without having ever seen it before. That of a father, scowling at a child bothering him over the morning's breakfast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you need to use any of the gold or supplies, please make a list, Erin. I'll calculate the efficiency later. Also, try not to make a mess? Do you even know how alcohol is made?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have a Skill! Why, do &lt;em&gt;you?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know it &lt;em&gt;ferments&lt;/em&gt;. So good luck with your [Field of Preservation] Skill."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The newspaper rose. Erin opened and closed her mouth. Then she looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, someone's getting their [Sasser] class."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What was that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin innocently got up. Mrsha hopped off the table as Erin rose. Sunlight poured through the window where she'd been napping on a table. It was a beautiful morning. And Lyonette's increased backchat aside, Erin felt good. She stretched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey Mrsha, want to help me make alcohol? You can't drink any, but it'll be fun! Probably! We'll do it outside or something. Maybe that [Fermenter] dude in Liscor could help? Um—Ushel! Hey, Mrsha, let's go for a trip!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll cub sat on her butt on the floor and quickly raised her paws. She signed to Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Don't…like…&lt;/em&gt;is that your word for alcohol? &lt;em&gt;Stinky?&lt;/em&gt; Don't like stinky alcohol? Gotcha! Well, I'll pay you in stinky &lt;em&gt;cheese&lt;/em&gt; howzabouthat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman laughed and Mrsha laughed too. Erin looked around. Lyonette sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I suppose I'll handle breakfast, then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She turned a page, frowning at an illustration of a battle at sea. Drassi was cleaning up and serving food to Temile; few of the regulars had come in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was early. And the [Actor] was blinking at his food as if he didn't know what he was supposed to do with it. Numbtongue hadn't even woken up yet. Erin smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As she thrust open the door and Apista fluttered out of the Garden of Sanctuary, high once again, Erin Solstice inhaled the fresh morning air. She opened her mouth to shout a greeting towards Liscor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then she saw it. A flash of azure. A gleaming body, walking up the hill towards the inn. Mrsha sniffed the air and Erin froze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no. It's her again!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette glanced up as Erin slammed the door shut and ran. The [Princess] glanced up as Mrsha opened the door and peeked out. She waved one paw and the figure waved back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The inn was silent for a few more seconds as Lyonette debated getting up. But she was invested in the dramatic retelling of the battles at sea—the fate of the [Strategists] and &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; still unknown. They had been lost in the storm for days! She kept reading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And a Hobgoblin walked down the steps. Numbtongue scratched at his side and yawned. He walked into the kitchen and waved at Lyonette. She smiled at him, far more cordial than with Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Morning, Numbtongue. We have a &lt;em&gt;newspaper&lt;/em&gt; today."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He paused on his way to the kitchen. Mrsha raced over and gave him a flying kick to the leg. The [Bard] barely noticed, although he winced slightly. Lyonette glared, but the Hobgoblin never objected; you got hit far worse in spars and Mrsha enjoyed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A newspaper. It's this new Pallassian thing. Well, new for…Pallass. Palt brought it in last night. You can read it over breakfast; I'm nearly done with it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Morning, Numbtongue! Want today's menu? It's, uh, eggs benedictal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette corrected Drassi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Benedict. On Erin's weird muffins."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;English muffins!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone called from the kitchen. There was a &lt;em&gt;crash&lt;/em&gt;, and a few scuffling sounds. Numbtongue glanced towards the kitchen, but accepted whatever was happening wordlessly. He shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll find food."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alright, then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin went into the kitchen and poked around in the cupboards as Mrsha peeked out the door again and waved once more. She got another wave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue hunted around in the cupboards for what he wanted. No eggs, thanks. He was in a fishy mood today. He liked fish. He pulled out a rather magnificent flatfish, drizzled with Gnollish fish sauce. Salty, fresh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delicious. All it needed was heat. The Hobgoblin hummed as he turned to one of the ovens. Stone ovens of course, although Lyonette and Erin wanted to upgrade it. He had to light it; when he did he heard a yelp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From within. The Hobgoblin stared. He opened the oven's door slowly. And saw a young woman &lt;em&gt;squeezed&lt;/em&gt; into the massive oven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice informed Numbtongue. He met her eyes. Slowly, he closed the oven door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And please put the fire out!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin went for the lower oven. He warmed up his fish…took the hot plate, cursing as he burned his fingers. Then he edged out of the kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;By the time Numbtongue had made his food, the guest had entered the inn. She'd walked; the staff didn't begin checking the magic door until a bit later. So, Xrn, the Small Queen, Centenium and [Thaumaturge], was relatively alone in the inn. The Wistram [Mages] hadn't come down yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stood in the middle of the room as Numbtongue stared. But—he had met her already. So he just edged over to a table and began to eat his fish. Lyonette glanced up as Drassi hurried over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Xrn! How can we help you today?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Centenium's mandibles opened and rose. And Xrn's eyes shone bright yellow and green. Mrsha sat and stared up at her. For the azure Antinium was pure magic. And the staff she used to walk with shone with it. Even Lyonette could see that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they'd already been introduced. Xrn nodded to Drassi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I would like to speak to Innkeeper Erin Solstice, again. Drassi of the Drakes. Is she here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She just was. I think she'll be about."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hmm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn swept her gaze across the inn. She stared into the Garden of Sanctuary and Lyonette saw her eyes flash white for a moment. The gemstone of her staff glittered. It was some fine-cut, purple-and-green gemstone that shifted from color to color. It &lt;em&gt;hovered&lt;/em&gt; in the center of floating fragments of wood, forming a loose circle around it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium turned her head, inspecting the Garden of Sanctuary although she made no move for the door.&lt;em&gt; Searching. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] folded the newspaper, and handed it to Numbtongue as she made her way into the kitchen. She looked around, heard the breathing from the oven and opened it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin stared at Lyonette. She had folded herself into the oven. She slowly raised one finger and put it to her lips. Lyonette put her hands on her hips, exasperated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you &lt;em&gt;hiding&lt;/em&gt; in the oven?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Is she gone?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. She wants you. &lt;em&gt;Erin.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman waved her hands urgently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't say my name! Don't—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello, Erin Solstice. Is this some new game? Or custom? You must show it to me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn the Small Queen appeared in the kitchen's opening. Lyonette turned. Erin slowly pulled the door of the oven up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was no use. In moments, Erin, a bit sooty and cramped, sat nervously at a table as Drassi put down a plate of benedict eggs in front of Xrn, on an English muffin. The Antinium's eyes lit up with pleasure, which was pink in this case. She ate, happily chewing the eggs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, they are different than normal eggs. How wonderful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's the sauce. Glad you like them…Xrn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin watched the female Antinium eating the muffins, gluten, without issue. Xrn spoke as she savored each bite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have come once again. Have you given any thought to my offers?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] &lt;em&gt;squirmed&lt;/em&gt; in her seat. The Small Queen regarded her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Well…&lt;/em&gt;I mean, I'd like to, Xrn. And you helping with the, um, Hive is great. Klbkch was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; mad. And I get you're in charge, now, but…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is there some issue with my requests?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin twiddled her fingers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…No? But it's just sort of…big. I mean, I'll totally agree to the stuff with the food. But everything else?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Xrn. The Small Queen had come three days ago. And she had changed the Free Antinium. Klbkch, who had been driven to a rage Erin had never seen before was—dealt with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one had died. The Antinium had been welcomed back into their Hive. Klbkch had even taken a vacation from the Watch; he was no longer in charge of the Free Antinium, and Erin understood that this was only the beginning of the changes to the Hive. Big ones had begun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Xrn had sought Erin out. Not in an aggressive way, but she had come to the inn over the last three days. And but for the moment with Saliss, she had been welcoming—even playful with Mrsha. She was respectful, &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; Erin's food and seemed to appreciate all of the Antinium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—the Small Queen regarded Erin over her food as she raised another bite to her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What will you refuse, Erin Solstice? By all means, tell me any objections and I will do my utmost to rectify them. Is cost an issue? I will double your price."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette's head snapped up. Erin winced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, it's not that. It's so—sudden? I mean, some of it—why me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Centenium folded her two arms. And she had only two. She smiled again and her eyes lit up with a multitude of colors. She was fascinating to Erin. And yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because you are Erin Solstice. And we have need of you. Will you not take more Antinium into your inn? Allow them to live here? At least Pawn, and a few others. They may even share a room. Or do you object to teaching the Antinium? Apprenticing Garry? Allowing them to eat here regularly? Is instructing the others and allowing them to play games in your inn an issue? We are quite willing to pay for more buildings. I would prefer to quarter as many as three hundred Antinium in proximity of the inn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman opened and closed her mouth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—the lots of Antinium nearby is the big thing. And…teaching them? I mean, sure! Let's have them have patrols in here like normal. And eating! And I can have some of the rooms with Antinium in them! Definitely Pawn! Lyonette was saying we had rooms for him and a few others—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw Lyonette nodding. Mrsha glowered as she poked her head over the table. Erin glanced at her. Xrn however just smiled. She offered Mrsha some of her muffin and the Gnoll took it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is all well. And it is enough. But you seem to have reservations?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Erin. The young woman hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—it's just so generous. I mean—why do you want me to do all this? The Antinium are paying a lot. And…I just don't know what the Antinium get out of this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is not something I can name in words, Erin Solstice. Or if I could—it is only your kindness. I have not been here long. But I hear it in all the Antinium's words about you. Pawn, Belgrade, Anand, Garry—and the others. Give them all that you have. Even if it is but laughter and love. Give them Individuality. Give them your magic. If you will not allow hundreds of Antinium to wait upon you—or enter the Hive to train my people, I will be content with the rest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin found herself nodding. She agreed completely with &lt;em&gt;that.&lt;/em&gt; Give the Antinium love? Xrn was great. Amazing, really. If it was just that…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So…Klbkch isn't in charge?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He is learning to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;. He is a fool. I have hit him with my staff multiple times, but he only understands war. Klbkch the Slayer is an apt term for him. Also: flawed beyond belief because it is incomplete. He is more than a weapon. But he is a poor leader. He does not appreciate what you can &lt;em&gt;do.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen looked at Erin. The young woman found herself nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. You're so—&lt;em&gt;caring&lt;/em&gt;, Xrn. Pawn was saying that when he came in. Why are you so—not Klbkch?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium &lt;em&gt;loved &lt;/em&gt;Xrn. The female Antinium's eyes lit up with pleasure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed, I am not Klbkchhezeim. I fully appreciate many things he was never meant to. I was designed to lead. To inspire. To foresee the future of what we might be. To cast magic, as well. Klbkch was ever meant to slaughter our foes. To pile the bodies of the dead into walls around our Hives. He has learned leadership. But part of him is still the lone warrior who would walk into an army of foes without fear of death. I am glad he has recovered some of his power, but he is a fool."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin half-smiled. But then Xrn went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And yet—he learned some of his empathy from you. I hope you will allow him back into your inn. He must learn. And so must the Antinium. He is our fool. Please, teach him more. And give him—give the Antinium some of your magic. Perhaps Klbkch should stay in this inn. Although Pawn did object."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you finished, Miss Xrn? Can I get you more?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drassi went by to take the plate. The Centenium shook her head. She stood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am finished. Miss Erin Solstice, would you do me the courtesy of allowing me into your garden?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Of course."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn even asked. She walked into the garden. And her eyes shone as green and vibrantly as the grass, mixed with the clear blue of the skies. Like magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How &lt;em&gt;beautiful.&lt;/em&gt; Look at the power of it. And you have shown me your magical fire. It is, like my magic, a power not known to [Mages] or Antinium. A different sort of power. Please, Erin Solstice. I will send the Antinium to you. Give them your strength. We have need of it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young [Innkeeper] saw Xrn glance over her shoulder. Even in this—Erin felt so strongly for Xrn. She whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll try. But I don't know what I do. I just—care."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. You, among others, care when the other species do not. And that makes Antinium Individual. Do so. I will send the Silent Antinium, the Flying, and Armored Antinium to you. Excuse their faults. Even Pivr's. And in return—give them Individuality. Allow them to level. Give them your power as Pawn and Belgrade and the others have. They must have it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen stood in the garden. And she raised her staff towards the sunlight streaming through the ceiling. Her voice was so fond, so—almost motherly, or perhaps like a big sister's, so affectionate, Erin nearly forgot. But then—the Small Queen went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And I have heard of your power. The—coincidences. Can you find me a ship? Allies to crew it, perhaps?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A ship?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen looked at Erin. She nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If it is within your power. The people you know. Find us allies? I will reward every endeavor, every action of good faith, Erin Solstice. As I told you, here—you may name your boon. Will you not take the Free Antinium's gold? We have enough to build your inn a hundred times over. I would give you ten thousand gold pieces if you would accept them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes glinted. And a bit of red, purple, and black—the color, swimming amid her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A hundred thousand pieces if you can create in one of the Antinium a change like that of Pawn's. He will be a glorious leader. He can &lt;em&gt;heal&lt;/em&gt;. Even block Klbkch. Yes, we need him. We need your power. The Antinium must be &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt;. Our foes are mighty. I would have an army of eight hundred thousand Painted Antinium at the least. And they would be unmatched save for  the True Antinium's power."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And there it was. Darkness floating amid her eyes. She turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"War is coming, Erin Solstice. Turn the Antinium into a blade. You have reservations—but I will give you what you wish. Do you wish me to enchant your inn? I have the magic for it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice looked at her. And she saw it in Xrn again, the same as when she'd met. And every time Xrn had visited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Klbkch was one thing. Flawed, kindly—somehow a dangerous killer and her old friend at the same time. But Xrn?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She scared Erin out of her wits. Because she didn't hide what she was. Erin licked her dry lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Enchant my inn…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. I am &lt;em&gt;Xrn.&lt;/em&gt; My magic is not the same as that of the three [Mages] under your roof. But I have my own enchantments. I will render each you require. Ask. If you wish me to enchant your walls—I will do so. Would you like them stronger? With the power to attack back?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can do that? Just do that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Naturally. I am unique as all the Centenium are. I was &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; for magic. And unlike Klbkch, my form remains. I am specialized, Erin Solstice. Ask and if it is within my power or that of the Antinium, it will be done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin did not. She looked at Xrn. She took a breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm happy to have the Antinium here, Xrn. But—can't you—I don't want the Antinium to become a blade. Can't you talk to Saliss? Or Chaldion? Well, he's in the hospital. But the others…you scare the Drakes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Centenium paused. She looked at Erin, kindly. And Erin sensed how old she was. Xrn smiled. But the creeping blackness in her eyes shone. Laced with silver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There is little to say to the Drakes, Erin Solstice. They continue to war against us, even in 'peace'. They would not believe anything we say. And they are right to fear us. But our foe is greater than you can imagine. And I bear you no ill will. Just all the gratitude I have. But I cannot give you either reassurance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even about the Antinium turning into weapons? Pawn isn't a weapon."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The azure Antinium looked at Erin. She smiled. Amused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Erin Solstice. You see what Klbkch does not. And perhaps that is why you are so…important. But we were &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; made to be weapons. For victory, we will charge into slaughter itself and die. Give us what you can and perhaps some might be saved. I implore you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bowed. Erin had nothing to say to that. The Antinium spoke, and Erin listened. Some things she agreed to. But the rest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At her heart, Xrn was a warrior. She was a kindly, caring, empathetic big sister. And she had killed her enemies by the millions and walked through their blood. She would again, in a heartbeat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what Erin saw. And Xrn didn't press. She offered everything. Gold, power. And Erin took only what mattered to her. In some ways—she and Xrn had little to offer each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When Xrn was gone, Lyonette turned to face Erin. She hadn't heard all of it. But she saw Erin's face. And it was…unsettled. Few people had ever done that to Erin Solstice, so the [Princess] revised her opinion of Xrn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did she ask if she could build an apartment for the Antinium again? Three hundred of them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And she offered to &lt;em&gt;give &lt;/em&gt;me thirty regular Soldiers and Workers like Bird for the inn's staff. To do with as I pleased, for a year. My own army, because she's sure they'll level. She's &lt;em&gt;intense.&lt;/em&gt; I thought Klbkch was intense! But he's like…soft cheese!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette looked at Erin. And she bit her lip on how useful thirty free staff members would be, even if Erin insisted on paying them. Erin Solstice stared after where Xrn had stood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think she understands what you can do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] turned her head. And she looked tired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. I probably could…but I don't want to turn them into weapons. And Xrn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw Xrn, through the doorway, standing in the inn, squatting to speak to Mrsha and stroke her head. The kindly one. Erin didn't know who Xrn's foe was. The Centenium had offered to tell Erin everything if Erin would swear to her cause. But it would take Erin swearing an oath. To be committed to the Antinium forever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The cause of the Antinium. To war. Erin shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wandering Inn&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;was not a place of war.&lt;/em&gt; It was an inn. But—if you looked at Klbkch, you saw Senior Guardsman Klbkch, Revalantor Klbkch, Klbkch the Slayer. And only one of those was the monster of war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Xrn was all death. She saw the Antinium for who they were, with their personalities and feelings. And she cared. But she had told Erin they were meant to die, and that the cause they would die for was just, right. Unavoidable. Worth burning all the Walled Cities down for. Worth waging war against the entire world for. Something Xrn feared and hated more than her love for her people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin wondered what that was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Still—Xrn got her way. The Antinium would come to Erin's inn. Each night, in fact. They had a &lt;em&gt;budget&lt;/em&gt;. And it was large enough to make Lyonette smile all day—and that was aside from the news that Pawn and at least a dozen Antinium would have rooms in Erin's inn as the second and third floors were constructed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn had paid in advance. And they might double or even go three to a room, but they'd be here. Heck—she was doing great things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And terrible. And it wasn't like her presence didn't affect Erin. It did—it made Erin worried. And thoughtful. Just not predisposed to support Xrn wholly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So Erin amended her plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not gonna make alcohol. Too much work. I'll just roll into phase two of my plan. It's all related. I'm gonna borrow the kitchen, okay, Lyonette? I'm making stuff for Palt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] could never follow Erin. She eyed the young woman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How is alcohol and the kitchen related for…&lt;em&gt;oh.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes widened. Erin blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, sorry. Not &lt;em&gt;Palt&lt;/em&gt;. Pelt! Those names are so similar, it cracks me up each time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grinned. Then she pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Door! Kitchen!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin walked into the kitchen. Lyonette followed her, sighing. She walked into the inn and began serving clients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wistram [Mages] came downstairs. Palt, as always, had trouble navigating the stairwell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Move it, Palt! I'm &lt;em&gt;hungry!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa complained. Beza reached out and Palt nearly bit at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Push me and I'll kick you, Bezale! I'm hurrying!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's for breakfast?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Eggs benedict! &lt;/em&gt;Get them while it's hot! Can I borrow the newspaper when you're done, Numbtongue? I want to share it with my friends. Isn't it &lt;em&gt;amazing?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mhm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Wistram [Mages] exchanged a knowing glance about the newspaper. But Palt was heading over to a table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think we'll be investigating this um, Golden Triangle thing. We've got orders from the top, Palt. You?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm off my leash. The Golden Triangle?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. In Pallass. Apparently Naili wants us on it &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Something to do with, you know? The guests? Sounds like trouble, but what do I know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa rolled her eyes as she took her plate. Beza was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We will look into it. Quickly. Apparently, some [Lords] have joined the movement. And nations. Thousands of gold are being turned into profits."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; hear about it. It sounds lucrative. Only…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Palt's eyes narrowed. He glanced at the kitchen and Montressa sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You do your thing. We'll do ours."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe I'll just see if Erin wants to chat. Or—if she needs help. Is she cooking, Lyonette?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something, Palt. If you want to help, be my guest. And if you could make some more of your saffron rice tonight? It always sells!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette smiled gratefully at the Centaur. He trotted into the kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A few seconds later he trotted out. Beza and Montressa looked up as he went back to his plate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's wrong, Palt? Not gonna help Erin out?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa gave the Centaur a suspicious look. The [Illusionist] pulled out a smokeless cigar—he was running out—and shuddered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not this time. I would, but…I can't help with construction or tasting. Not my field."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Beza looked incredulous. But Palt just nodded to the kitchen. A young woman edged out. She was holding something. She lifted it and the Minotauress' jaw dropped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can I get anyone to help me taste test this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue, Mrsha, and Beza all stared at what Erin was holding. Mrsha fainted onto the ground. Numbtongue slowly raised a hand. Beza looked at Montressa and grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I knew I liked this inn. I'll help! Is it free?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin, what is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman grinned. Her creation, made of sin and gluttony, &lt;em&gt;dripped&lt;/em&gt; onto the floor. Mrsha raced over like a shot out of a cannon, begging and drooling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A gift! I'm going to Pallass. Once I perfect the recipe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pallass. The City of Inventions. A glorious land that was a type of heaven for the [Engineer], the aspiring [Alchemist] or [Inventor]. A place where you could be funded to follow your passions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because that was what happened. Small or large, new inventions and recipes came from Pallass. And you could be granted a stipend depending on what you did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course, a Walled city had so many other industries and things it supported that was only one aspect of it. But Pallass was the City of Inventions. It specialized in forging weapons, in alchemy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Just like how Oteslia was an agricultural giant, or how Salazsar ruled the gem trade. Each Walled City specialized in a trade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Just look at Saliss of Lights, simultaneously one of Pallass' treasures and their disgrace. The Named Adventurer wasn't causing trouble today. He'd sequestered himself away to teach his new apprentice some tricks. And because a strange female Drake had smashed another raid on an illicit bar the other night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But that wasn't the topic on everyone's tongues. That was the [Strategists], who were right now in Zeres. And amid the hustle and bustle of the city came…poison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Or perhaps, a kind of madness incarnate. A manifestation of chaos, like Saliss was. But if he was a known force, born of Pallass, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; was an unknown quantity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An omen you listened to by the shouting or screaming. A harbinger of doom. Had she brought the Wyverns or had the impending event drawn her? And who watched for her?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only the wise, who had seen what might be and could be. Was that all just exaggeration?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maybe. Or maybe not. Sergeant Kel eyed Erin as he checked her, Montressa, and Beza through the gate that led from the magical door to the rest of Pallass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No trouble, Miss Solstice?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whaaaaat? Me? And you didn't have to search my stuff! It's just &lt;em&gt;food!&lt;/em&gt; Hey, want a snack?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin pouted as she hefted her rather big basket past the guards. A Gnoll was &lt;em&gt;sniffing&lt;/em&gt; and licking his lips. Kel eyed Beza. The [Spellscribe] was walking while holding her stomach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't believe you ate all of it. I felt sick watching."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa covered her mouth. Erin reached into her basket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've got extras! Not the thing, but want some cookies?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Watch brightened. Kel, on the other hand, had heard the devil's whispers. He looked chaos in the eye and denied it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. We are on duty, Miss Solstice. Stop feeding the Watch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw. You're no fun."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin stuck out her tongue. Some of the [Guards] grumbled under their breath, but stopped as Kel glared at them. He made a little note and sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone run this to the Watch House. Tell the Watch Captain on duty Miss Erin Solstice is in Pallass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the junior [Guards] looked incredulous. He, a Garuda, saluted Kel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sergeant, surely we don't have to tell the Watch Captain &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; Human…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He fell silent as Kel &lt;em&gt;glowered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take the note. Or do you not remember the Antinium and Wyverns? She was &lt;em&gt;there.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Watch fell silent. And they were learning. But was this force friendly or dangerous? She had toppled cities, brought low the ambitions of [Lords]. What might she get up to? But the law let her into the city. So, thus, Sergeant Kel reflected gloomily, the law was not infallible. And you wouldn't know what happened until…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm gonna go do my thing. Have fun!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice waved to Montressa and Beza. The two [Mages] nodded and walked off, already headed for the Merchant's Guild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Innkeeper] on the other hand? She went about her mission. And yes—she was pulling a Xrn in her own way, but Erin didn't like thinking of it like that. She just had her…network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, Lorent! How's my favorite [Sharpener]? Want a cookie? I keep meaning to thank you for finding my knife…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin paused by a familiar stall and chatted with a Dullahan. He was only too happy to run her kitchen knife across his sharpening stone and chat for a moment. Just for a moment, but she headed onwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman was beginning to know more of the city. She had plans to explore even further—but for now she headed to the nearest elevator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ninth floor, please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She cheerfully called out with the other people waiting. The elevator attendant  glanced at Erin. His eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Human? The one with Bird the—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Nope! You must have me confused! Us Humans all look alike!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin waved her hands urgently. And soon, she was strolling across the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor. She passed by forges and [Smiths] called out to her. Somehow, in a city of millions, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; knew her. Even, or especially the high-level ones! Waiting clients and Street Runners blinked as Erin waved and crossed the hammering forges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that Bealt? Have a cookie! Sorry, &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; delivery. Is Pelt working today? He is? Where—oh, right by Maughin again! Thanks!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin trotted over to the safety-line and then hurried over to a forge. She saw a huge Dullahan look up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Solstice? What brings you here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maughin! Hey! Want a &lt;em&gt;cookie?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was Erin's line for the day. The [Armorer] was only too glad to chat, but he was a bit busy so he only gave Erin the briefest of greetings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a busy day. I will have to work hard to make it back to spend time with Jelaqua, Erin. So forgive me my brusqueness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's back? That's great! You lucky dog, you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dullahan gave Erin a blank look as one of his apprentices held out his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am not a dog. But yes, I am happy. The Halfseekers were on the television, actually."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? &lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Seborn?&lt;/em&gt; No way! I'll ask Rufelt and Lasica to show me! I should buy a scrying orb! Wait. Who's calling it television?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wistram. Why are you here, Miss Erin?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman gestured at the basket, warming in the heat from the forges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm looking for Pelt. Is he here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maughin pointed left. Erin blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But that forge is &lt;em&gt;full!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Indeed, the forge had no less than &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; people working in it, none of them Dwarf-sized. And they were busy moving the anvils, clustering around…Erin squinted. She walked over and stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. &lt;em&gt;Pelt?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf looked up from the circle of apprentices and junior [Smiths] hanging on his words. And 'junior' was a relative term. Erin saw a [Blacksmith] in his forties hurrying off with Pelt's apprentice, Emessa. Erin blinked after them. And then she saw Pelt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He scowled at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's you again. Grandfather's beards, what do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want? Stay away from my fire! And stand over there! They're moving the anvils and if they drop it on your foot, I'm not paying for it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He waved his hammer at Erin. She backed off obediently and saw a group of [Smiths] lugging over an anvil. Which was &lt;em&gt;impressive&lt;/em&gt; given that anvils at their lightest were nearly a hundred pounds and could go up to five hundred pounds in an ordinary forge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Pallass did not have ordinary forges. These anvils needed special stands to even withstand the impact and weight. But Pelt was moving his.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right! Into this section—here! Damn it, &lt;em&gt;don't touch the circle or I'll pull your intestines out with my tongs you clod-footed idiots! &lt;/em&gt;And the other one in the sealed space, there!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But master, there's no ventilation!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emessa protested as she pointed to a cordoned-off area. Erin saw black curtains hanging, and a stand for the anvil. The Dwarf turned purple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ventilation? &lt;/em&gt;Don't backchat me—&lt;em&gt;apprentice!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Emessa."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin whispered. Pelt glared at her. He bellowed at the Drake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can debate with me when you're &lt;em&gt;twenty&lt;/em&gt; levels higher! Move those anvils! And get me my prepared tools and ingredients! And if I catch one of you walking off with them I'll cut off your right hand! &lt;em&gt;A Dwarf's oath on that.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The last line was delivered deadly serious. The [Smiths] shuddered as Pelt bellowed. They got to work. Erin stared at Pelt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He seemed…energetic. The Dwarf turned and glared at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do you want, Human?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…just thought I'd bring a &lt;em&gt;sorry-&lt;/em&gt;basket. Lunch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin offered her basket to Pelt. The Dwarf sniffed suspiciously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why would I want anything you made? And why are you here? The last time we met in Pallass the sky was shitting Wyverns—after you got arrested and wrecked a good forge!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin winced. That had been a day. She smiled as she hefted the heavy basket; even with [Lesser Strength] she was getting tired of holding it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because…I'm an [Innkeeper]. And I made something good. &lt;em&gt;Promise!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf eyed her with deep distrust. But he nodded to one side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alright. Put it down there. I need to check on the magic circle. Stand there and &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; conjure any magic fire! Or I'll—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pull my guts out with a tong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—kick you off the side of the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf glowered and stomped off. Pelt inspected his forge, snapping at his apprentices. And it was—different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Especially from Maughin's forge, or the other smaller forges catering to individual blacksmiths they could use. This one looked—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magical. It spoke to Erin. Especially the glowing circle traced in what looked like powdered gemstone in the floor. The diagram was etched around the circle, giving the smith room to stand in. There was a dark room to forge in, another with a hole cut in the ceiling—even the forges were being remodeled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This one needs to burn about ten times as hot as a charcoal forge. At &lt;em&gt;least. &lt;/em&gt;If we need to, we'll get an [Enchanter] here to work on it. But we won't be able to melt Dwarfsteel with this shit flame."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pelt kicked at the forge, which would get to temperatures that would melt steel. His apprentices were cluttered around. Erin peeked over as Pelt cursed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't ask me &lt;em&gt;how!&lt;/em&gt; I'll build it myself if I need to! Just get to work on today's orders! I'll handle the Dwarfsteel and higher metals. You—take the mithril crap. Apprentice—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Emessa—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Shut up, Human! &lt;/em&gt;Start with the silver. The rest of you, the steel orders! I'll do the embellishing—just get it in a workable piece! Don't ask questions! If you forge shit, I'll see it and stop you. Any imperfection &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; will catch. And I'll only break one finger per flaw! &lt;em&gt;Get to work!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf howled and his crew got to work. They didn't use either of the special forges, opting to use the regular anvils. Erin saw Pelt stomp back towards her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry about that. Rookie smiths. Idiots think they know what steel is. You got them all the time in Deríthal-vel. Dwarfhome. What's in the basket?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He seemed calmer now. Erin stared at Pelt. She looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, I'm in the wrong place. I'm looking for a rude jerk. Always drunk? You're nearly him, but you're too awake."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pelt glowered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Human. I'm &lt;em&gt;working.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt; You? I mean…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin bit her lip. She remembered Pelt hammering on the Grasgil bardiche. After her fire—but this wasn't that Pelt. Torn by grief and pride. This was—a mix between the Pelt she'd known, the grumpy alcoholic, and a working Pelt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He wasn't happy. But Pelt's scowl indicated his entire forge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Have to earn money somehow, don't I? And yes, I hired more apprentices. Less work for me, I realized. They do the hammering and so long as they don't &lt;em&gt;overheat the metal—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bellowed and all the [Smiths] jumped. They snatched their billets out of the fire and inspected them. Pelt looked at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—I can do the finishing touches. Most metal—you don't need to put a Skill into if the metal's right. You just need to forge to shape, and even an idiot can do that. Well—probably."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He glared at his team again. Erin put down her basket on an anvil. She began to unwrap her present.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh huh. So…did you sell the Grasgil axe?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. It got enchanted. Waste of potential; the idiot just added to the freeze. It'll be a low Gold-rank adventurer's weapon. But that's how it works. Anyways, the city gave me some drinking funds. Idiots. But I spent some of it and this is the result."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pelt spoke briskly. He watched as Emessa brought back her billet and began to hammer it carefully. He glanced at Erin—one of his apprentices &lt;em&gt;sniffed.&lt;/em&gt; The Dwarf, who had seen a lot of marvels of steelwork, stopped and stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; abomination, Human?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The—thing that Erin held was in theory, a sandwich. But it was mainly meat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meat&lt;/em&gt;, the best cuts she could find, some fried, others prepared in different ways. Bacon, salami, cuts of beef, pork, chicken—layered with mustard, mayonnaise, other condiments—and some onions and pepper too. Vegetables hadn't been &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; banned from this concoction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was madness. &lt;em&gt;Heavy,&lt;/em&gt; too. A carnivore's dream. Erin hefted it up and showed it to Pelt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm calling it a 'Meat Supreme Sub'. Because it's a lotta meat. I thought you'd like it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf stared. The Drakes, and Gnolls both stared. One of the Dullahans gagged. But Pelt licked his lips slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You…made that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin beamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup! Well—I thought of you, and Relc, and a few others. Most people shouldn't eat this. Ever. But [Smiths] use up a lot of energy, right? Dawil loved meat stuff. So…want some? I know I'm not as good as Lasica is, but I can do food like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had cut the sandwich in half. Whatever that meant; you couldn't &lt;em&gt;bite&lt;/em&gt; it. Well—Beza could. But only just.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So could Pelt. The Dwarf picked up the sandwich, inspected the contents, and &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; gingerly. He chewed as Erin watched. And chewed…and chewed…and swallowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think I will be sick."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maughin announced. But Pelt took another bite. A drooling  Gnoll—Bealt—came over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, Pelt. You're getting Miss Erin to hand-deliver you food? Mind if I take a—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pelt kicked at him without a word. The [Farrier] retreated. The Dwarf kept eating as Erin watched. After a while, he stopped. The Dwarf eyed the sandwich, and then Erin's smiling face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You've got some on your beard."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Blacksmith] snorted and kept eating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'd be welcome in Dwarfhome, girl. Even the old Grandfathers would love you. What's this, a bribe? It's not worth a knife. If you want, I'll smith you a set of those crap steel knives. But nothing made of a better metal. I want payment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded at the ones on Erin's side. She sat on a desk and kicked her legs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't need another knife. I was just giving this to say sorry, honest. I've got something else, but I'd bother you with it, anyways."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf nearly snorted some of the sandwich out his nose. He coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Least you're honest. So—what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mm. Tell me about your forge, first. This is &lt;em&gt;amazing.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why? I'm hiring apprentices and I added a few new additions. What—the anvils? That's just protective magic and to help with the forging. These idiots—Pallass knows how to do a lot with steel, but they don't know &lt;em&gt;magical&lt;/em&gt; forging. I'd have been better off going to Chandrar or Baleros for that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf's voice carried. Bealt frowned as he investigated the other half of the sandwich. Pelt raised a hammer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't think you can eat it all. Maybe share?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin opined. The Dwarf eyed the sandwich and his stomach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Generous, aren't you? Fine, give the food away. It's not mine and it is…good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A grudging compliment. Erin beamed. Bealt grabbed the sandwich half and raced off with it. Half a dozen Gnolls pursued him. Erin idly watched as Pelt kept eating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—do you feel better, then?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"After you shamed me into remembering my craft? &lt;em&gt;Guess. &lt;/em&gt;I'd rather jump off the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, but since I already thought about that years ago, I guess I have to actually work."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf put down his sandwich. Erin stopped kicking her feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For what? If I wasn't ashamed, staring at your little cold flame wouldn't have done a thing. Nor will I thank you. Since that damn cold flame might have lured all the Frost Wyverns here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman paled. The Dwarf laughed and slapped his chest at the expression on her face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hah! Got you! &lt;/em&gt;Anyways, if you're just guilty, you can fuck off. What else did you want?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was rather like…Ivolethe. That was what Erin thought. And Pelt was still Pelt. Rough around the edges didn't begin to describe him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet, Erin liked him. His wounded heart shone brighter to her than Xrn's deathly convictions. And—she took a breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So you're forging &lt;em&gt;magic? &lt;/em&gt;Magic metal, I mean, like Grasgil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right. I have the knowing and I was banished, not forbidden. Hah—as if they could forbid us. Better slaughter us all. Pallass has a lot of steel-knowledge. Little of adamantium or greater metals. I'll be forging magical blades. If I could stop these idiots from stealing everything!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf cursed and pointed. Maughin ducked his head back into his forge. So did half a dozen other [Smiths]. Erin grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, they're curious. And you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a master?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thieves is what they are. I'm almost tempted to smith one of the alloys and watch them kill themselves as it explodes on them. Or melts through their anvils. But—ah. Why am I telling you this? I'll manage. And if I can't go home, I can at least rule Pallass. &lt;em&gt;Is any of my metal ready?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf snatched up a hammer. Emessa hurried over with a rough shape forged out of silver. Pelt eyed it and, with his hammer alone, began to delicately refine it. Erin realized he was looking at—a horn? But not a horn as in warhorn. A…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll live on damn mundane craft. Like this. Some Wistram nonsense. What's this, a brass horn, only silver? Get me the drawing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Emessa already had it. Erin stared at a euphonium. Pelt scratched his head as he stared at the inner workings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. It'll be a pain to shape. Appr—&lt;em&gt;Emessa!&lt;/em&gt; Get me tubes this big. I'll refine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He held up his fingers and his apprentice hurried back to continue work. Casually, stopping to heat the silver or whatever alloy he was using, Pelt continued working as he shouted at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Thieves&lt;/em&gt; are the worst! But magic-forging isn't easy to steal! Besides—Pallass is paying me, so where else can I perform my art?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman looked around thoughtfully. She saw some [Smiths] glancing at Pelt, but they were indeed more curious about his anvils, yet untouched. One of his apprentices kept glancing at a group of cases. His metals? The Dwarf cursed, shaping the metal. A master, pride at least regained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that was when she struck. That snake in the grass, the temptress in some proverbial Garden of Eden. The young, Human woman leaned over and whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know…Liscor's small and out of the way. And we have forges. I think."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pelt stopped hammering for a second. A few of the Gnoll [Smiths] glanced up. And Kel's warning to the Watch Captains were too little, too late indeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The poison had taken root. The Dwarf narrowed his gaze and stroked his beard. He returned to hammering without a word. After a while he spoke, idly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peh. And what would &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; get, anyways?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I dunno. But I have lots of alcohol. And it's cheap. Plus—you could probably get your own forge. Liscor's expanding. I bet they'd &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; you room."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin Solstice smiled. And the [Smith] glanced up. He said nothing more. As alarm and a kind of anticipation spread across the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A harbinger of change. And more. Because Erin Solstice slowly dug in her pocket and pulled something out. Something she'd been meaning to ask about. And here was an expert. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; expert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Say—this is the real reason I dropped by. Can you tell me what…this is? Someone gave it to me and I don't know what it is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She handed Pelt a coin. Made of…a gleaming white-silver metal. &lt;em&gt;Mithril,&lt;/em&gt; she'd been told, by another Dwarf. Erin relayed that to Pelt, but not the strange dream of a night when she had been given it. The Dwarf snorted as he put down the finished horn for the euphonium—it only needed some polishing to remove the scaling, but it was nearly perfectly shaped!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you just ask every Dwarf you meet about metal, girl? Well—I suppose we know more than most. What…is this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, he turned over the coin in his hands. It was far larger than the coins of today. The size of her palm. And so delicately inscribed…but faded. Erin had always puzzled over it, wondering what the faded lettering and sigils on the coin were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was just something in the back of her head. An idle curiosity, and she had many. Like bikes. But Pelt held it now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know. I was hoping you knew. Dawil thought it was some old coin. Maybe a medallion or something fancy from another age?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pelt snorted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That idiot [Axe Champion]? He's no [Smith]. But—this is monetary. I'd bet my hammer on it. You can tell the intent. Big—might have been worth a lot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Might have been? You don't know either?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin was vaguely disappointed. Pelt flipped the coin over and eyed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What am I, a [Historian]? You should have asked one of them. No. I have no idea what it is. Only—that it's very old. So old that I doubt Humans lived on Izril in any numbers when it was made. No—older still."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin held her breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How old? Can you guess?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Smith] cast her an annoyed glance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's a guess! Mithril doesn't age like other metals. And as I said…the oldest of us might have identified it, but not me. Sorry, if you think it's worth a fortune. Still…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His brow furrowed. And the Dwarf slowly turned the coin over and over in his hands. And his face grew troubled. His voice dropped, and he spoke half to himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Odd. Mithril shouldn't &lt;em&gt;wear&lt;/em&gt; like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin frowned. And she felt a slight tingle on her arms. Because the more he looked at it, the more confused Pelt seemed to get. And—slightly unnerved, he put the coin down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know. I don't know who made it. Who…gave you this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Erin. And she stared at him and realized. He had seen it before. Something had flashed across his face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Distant recollection. A passing memory. But no more. &lt;em&gt;Still—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She kept her voice neutral.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A traveller. He wasn't sure what it was worth. Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No reason. Hm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf stared at the coin. He glanced up at Erin and casually turned as Emessa presented something that would become a valve for the euphonium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Leave it with me. I'll work on it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Work on it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin started. She stared at the Dwarf's back as he got to work. He nodded, barely glancing at the mithril.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's pure mithril, girl. Could be worth a lot. And I may not know what it was—but I can &lt;em&gt;restore&lt;/em&gt; it. Whatever design and lettering it was—I'll reveal it. Might lose a tiny bit of metal, but I doubt it. Come back in a few days and I'll give it to you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Thanks!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young woman smiled. The Dwarf nodded absently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you done? Then get lost."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah, yeah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Human grinned at him as she took her basket. The Dwarf glanced up at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—this Liscor. If your inn's nearby, that's free alcohol, right? And what else do they have that's worth it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Cheap. &lt;/em&gt;And uh—well, Esthelm mines stuff. It's connected to my inn. But it's mostly just private, y'know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hmm. Interesting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf turned away. Erin Solstice lingered a moment longer. And then she left. After all, this was just a small visit. An ordinary day. Not much happened on ordinary days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;After a while, Numbtongue finished eating. He felt…bloated. Too much rich food. And Erin's Supreme Meat…Meat Supreme Sub…hadn't helped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was gaining weight. Which, for a Goblin, was a sign of status. Safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And still, the [Goblin Soulbard] was discontent. Not in general, or out of some longing to find more of his kind. He had decided to stay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No, if anything, it was a bit of—jealousy. The Hobgoblin wandered out of the common room and into a hallway. There, he walked past Erin's weights room, her rec room (now being filled with some kind of odd table she insisted would become a 'pool'), and down the corridor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a door at the end. It had not existed, oh, a day ago. But Antinium did good work. Numbtongue appreciated the door. The door had done nothing wrong to him. Doors were excellent, in fact. Cover, improvised weapons, magical portals—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A sign hung over the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Octavia's Stitchworks.&lt;/em&gt; Numbtongue slowly opened the door. He looked inside. And sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Alchemist] was out. But her shop was nearly complete. At least—it was a room and he, Numbtongue, had helped the Stitch-Girl move her equipment inside. Again, just the other day. Octavia still needed a few more shelves and places for her weird equipment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it looked like a store. Her new shop, just as promised. And Numbtongue expected the place would be full of smells and strange sights. Mrsha was banned from entering, incidentally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—Octavia was not. And the [Alchemist] usually lived in her shop. But she was gone. She was now an apprentice to Saliss of Lights. Saliss the Naked. Saliss—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Who wasn't bad for a Named Adventurer. But still. Numbtongue idly sat on a counter. Octavia was a friend. More so than Drassi, who would talk with Numbtongue and not &lt;em&gt;stare&lt;/em&gt; or be nervous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Octavia was in the ranks of Erin, Lyonette, Yellow Splatters, Bird, and Mrsha. A group the Goblin could trust. And that she was gone was just annoying. Because Numbtongue found it was easiest to hang around her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette was always bossy. Erin? Lovely, talkative, friendly—but she would ask to play chess. Numbtongue was sick of chess. And Yellow Splatters had his Hive. And Bird started going insane without a bird every few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. Stupid Pallass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue sat on the counter. He idly wondered what he'd do today. Pyrite, in his head, opined for mining rocks. The [Magestone Chieftain] could and had mined in the mountains for days at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the [Bard] was a more social creature than Pyrite. He sighed. If he had to do it, he had to do it. Pyrite had found a vein of rubies or something. He kept finding them. The High Passes were lousy with the stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And just as Numbtongue was rising, he saw something. A little basket, on the counter. The Goblin paused. He saw a note. And it was addressed to him, on Octavia's neat scrawl. The only neat thing about her, really.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Numbtongue, sorry I've been so busy. But I'm actually &lt;/em&gt;leveling&lt;em&gt; and learning so much from Master Saliss! Ten times more than I did in a year in Celum. So, these are for you. They're all made by yours truly, with ingredients your stones paid for. Let me know how they work! I can make more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;–Octavia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And included in the basket were six vials. Numbtongue picked them out and sniffed at them. They were all stoppered with corks, and neatly labeled. He read from one label. Then another. And he began to grin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barkskin potion. Quickened Body potion. Vanish potion (14 seconds). Bat's Ear potion (No loud sounds!). Potion of Jumping. Blast Vial (Do NOT drop).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Potions. Each one a lesser effect. Of the lot, Barkskin and the Vanish potion were the most powerful. Not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; powerful. And that was because Octavia had made them. They even had times of how long each effect lasted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—it was a treasure trove to a Goblin, especially a Redfang Warrior. Numbtongue was grinning like a child as he put them on his belt for easy use. Because his dreams had come true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not even Silver-ranks could afford this kind of equipment. &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt;, the best-geared, could. And it was always nice when you looted their corpses and found potions like these. But this right here was an adventurer's spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Octavia had fulfilled her promise. The Hobgoblin patted the blast vial, which had reinforced glass. You could do &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; with these potions. A Vanish potion alone was worth everything to a Goblin. A single use of that and a Level 5 [Skulker] could, at the right moment, drop a [Mage] in the middle of casting. And Blast Vials?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Relatively weak if thrown—except if you made a Level 30 [Warrior] swallow one. In a sense, Numbtongue and his tribe were the most efficient potion-users in the world. You had to be, when your species couldn't manufacture these things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Goblin happily reminisced for a moment. But then he was bored again. Now-equipped, he &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; it was time to go into the mountains. He would have liked to take Octavia. But maybe Bird…?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin walked back into the common room. And there—his adventure in the mountains died, like Erin's dreams of brewing alcohol. Because, lying on the ground, arms and legs splayed out, on her back, was a white Gnoll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stared up at the ceiling as Numbtongue paused. Lyonette &lt;em&gt;tsked&lt;/em&gt; as she tried to nudge Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha! Stop lying there! You're going to be stepped on! I know you're bored, sweetie. Why don't you play in the garden?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll turned her head. &lt;em&gt;Garden?&lt;/em&gt; But what about people to play &lt;em&gt;with?&lt;/em&gt; She stared up at the ceiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No Relc today. No Ekirra or Visma; they were too busy helping their parents. No Selys. Mrsha stared up at the ceiling, willing something &lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt; to happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A green face appeared in her line of vision. Numbtongue leaned over Mrsha thoughtfully. The Gnoll stared up at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her tail began to wag. The Hobgoblin looked thoughtfully at the bored Gnoll. Then he reached down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hmm?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stood up and grabbed his hand. And thus, Mrsha the Great and Powerful, found the Great Goblin Bard, Numbtongue had come to rescue her from her prison of boredom!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—Numbtongue. Will you take care of Mrsha? That would help out so much!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin grinned at Mrsha. She grinned back and happily pointed. They ran into the garden, playing tag. Mrsha raced around, and saw Numbtongue &lt;em&gt;sprinting&lt;/em&gt; after her. She raced off, delightfully terrified. And the Goblin &lt;em&gt;dove&lt;/em&gt; after her. He didn't play games when he played games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two crashed through the jungle section. Mrsha dodged and Numbtongue &lt;em&gt;slammed&lt;/em&gt; into a tree, full-force as she swerved just in time. The Goblin cursed and something fluttered down from the tree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apista, stinger ready to attack, saw the big green thing just in time and aborted her vengeful dive. Numbtongue ducked as she zoomed past his head. And Mrsha, coming back to check on him, saw the bee flying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Upside-down. She zoomed around lazily; she'd been taking a nap in the tree. And Mrsha saw/smelled the odor in the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of Palt's cigars. She folded her arms disapprovingly as Numbtongue sniffed the air as well. Apista was &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. Again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee had a problem. She'd sip from the faerie flower's nectar, or steal a Palt-cigar. Or just steal alcohol from a mug after chasing away the owner. Lyonette told Mrsha it was probably Apista being…Apista.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Mrsha wasn't so certain. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; was a [Druid], but she'd also been a [Beast Tamer]. For a level or two! And she followed Apista as the bee flew around lazily. Numbtongue climbed up into the tree and retrieved the cigar. He began to puff on it—to make sure Apista wouldn't get high again. He was very helpful like that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apista let Mrsha scoop her up. Her antennae were moving around lazily. And her thoughts were—muddled. Mrsha peered down at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something was wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Mrsha had felt it before. Beneath Apista's hazy thoughts, the young [Druid] sensed—something. Apista could not speak. But then, neither could Mrsha. And her class was giving her another sense. And because Mrsha could not speak, she listened more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apista was unhappy. &lt;/em&gt;That was why she was always going away in her mind. The realization made Mrsha's eyes widen. Something was wrong. She lifted the bee up, put her on top of her head to better commune with nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue, puffing away on the remains of the cigar, watched Mrsha communing. She stood on one leg and raised her paws to the sky. It looked entertaining, so he copied her. Apista tried to do the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha scowled at the mockery. But then—she felt the flash again. Something…she concentrated, going serious for once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This wasn't like the &lt;em&gt;magic book&lt;/em&gt; which Mrsha hated so much. This was her class. This was Apista, her friend. And—slowly, she began to feel something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sadness.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pain. Worry.&lt;/em&gt; A bee's thoughts, so distant. Alien in her way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha asked. &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; A picture appeared in her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cave. Sealed with stone. Darkness. Lack of good air. Hunger. Hunger in the darkness and the knaves from below. Danger. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Danger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha's eyes opened wide. She knew what Apista was trying to tell her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cave.&lt;/em&gt; And Apista could do nothing. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was why she was upset!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee fluttered up. Mrsha watched Apista attacking Numbtongue for his cigar. She needed her fix. He fended her off, cursing as she threatened to attack him with her enhanced stinger. But Mrsha waved her paws for the Goblin's attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Bad thing! Bad thing! Must help!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She signed with her paws. Instantly, the Goblin stopped avoiding the bee. He handed the cigar off and squatted down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Erin and Lyonette weren't good at Mrsha-language. But Numbtongue and Bird were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What bad thing? Monsters?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;No. Apista sad. Bad cave. Go. Fix!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha pointed urgently at the bee. Numbtongue frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bad cave? Oh. Bees. Sealed inside. Dying?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded urgently. And something else. Numbtongue hesitated. He glanced at Apista.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bees are dangerous."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—both looked at Apista. She had lit the cigar, turning her body to flame for a moment. And the bee sadly smoked as she carried the cigar butt through the air. Look at her. And Mrsha looked up pleadingly at Numbtongue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin thought. Then he looked around. He made a quick calculation, and then nodded surreptitiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Make the Garden door go to my room?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha raced over to the door. She was best at using it besides Erin. The doorway's entrance appeared in Numbtongue's room. He walked into it. Came out with a pickaxe, and shovel. Mrsha watched, anxiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue nodded to himself. He began to walk towards the door and stairs—and then he looked back. He saw Mrsha anxiously holding the smoking bee in her paws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And this was where the Hobgoblin differed from Erin and Lyonette. He walked back over to his window instead. Opened it. He climbed out onto the roof. And then he waved at Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Coming?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The white Gnoll grinned. She leapt out the window and onto the roof. The Worker Antinium saw the Hobgoblin sliding down the roof. He leapt off, and then caught the Gnoll. They ran for it, out of view of the windows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And thus, the Bee Rescue Team was formed. They had one mission: rescuing bees. They charged down the hill, Apista flying overhead, leading the way. And Mrsha felt the bee's joy. Because she sensed Mrsha's intent. Numbtongue jogged after them, carrying his guitar on his back, the pickaxe, a sword at his side, a shovel as well—he'd forgotten his armor. But it was &lt;em&gt;heavy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee cave was a ways away from the inn. At least an hour's walk. Lyonette used to have to tromp through the snow for &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; with the sled. Mrsha soon grew tired of galloping up and down hills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Also—Numbtongue made her walk with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Watch for spider nests. See? There. There. And Rock Crabs over there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin was a good teacher in things that needed to be taught. Like Relc, he didn't believe in safety. Safety was an illusion. So he showed Mrsha as they walked how to best spot the pitfall traps the Shield Spiders made. And he showed Mrsha how to &lt;em&gt;look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She thought she knew how to look. She was a Plains Gnoll, after all! But she was a young one. And Numbtongue was like a seasoned [Hunter]. He kept his head on a swivel, and Mrsha copied him. He even spotted the skunk den before she smelled them and led her well away from them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee cave was like the image in Apista's head. Only—different. The bee had flown around it many times from the outside. Mrsha, with her different eyes, saw it as the cave opening—blocked by a wall of sheer stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Moore's work. He had sealed the cave to save his friends. And in doing so—he had condemned the Ashfire Bee Hive within to death. He had not thought of it that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Mrsha was a [Druid], not a [Green Mage]. She sensed them within.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bees&lt;/em&gt;. But—reduced in number. &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt;. The Gnoll solemnly placed her paw on the stone and looked at Numbtongue, pleadingly. The Hobgoblin eyed the stone. His posture changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magic wall. Not bad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pyrite authoritatively knocked on the stone. He looked at Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Angry bees. Need to prepare this. Here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He scaled up the cave's entrance. In his precious time, the [Chieftain] analyzed the stone cave. He dismissed going through the front at once; the stone was too thick. He found a weak point on the roof of the cave, instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here. Dig. And &lt;em&gt;here—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dirt and stones flew as the Goldstone Chieftain dug like a maniac. He was &lt;em&gt;fast!&lt;/em&gt; And he had allotted all of his minute and five seconds to the most efficient work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When he vanished, Numbtongue found himself patting Mrsha's head. The Gnoll was covered in dirt. And she was grinning. He hefted his shovel and kept digging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pyrite was smart. He had a plan. And it involved &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;First—he'd marked the hole in the cave's roof for Numbtongue to tunnel through. He'd even estimated the time it would take to breach a hole. And when that moment came—the bees would be &lt;em&gt;angry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So he'd also begun digging a hole for Mrsha and Numbtongue to dive into. They'd be shielded from bees and even be able to breathe. Now that was smart work. Numbtongue put his back into the digging. When it had met Pyrite's internal standards, he waved to Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get in hole."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She refused. She clambered up onto the cave's roof. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; was the [Druid]. Obviously, she had to be there. She could make the bees—less angry. Numbtongue scowled, but he could toss the Blast vial into the ceiling or use the potions Octavia had given them if he couldn't dive with her to safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine. You stand there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raised the pick and brought it down into the loose stone and dirt. It was hard work, but in between the [Bard]'s swings, Mrsha would scramble forwards with Apista and clear the rubble. She even tried to dig with him. She made a magical thorn on her paw and hit the ground energetically, if not exactly helpfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"New spell?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha shrugged. She watched as Numbtongue dug lower, creating a breach in the cave's roof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She could hear the bees.&lt;/em&gt; In her head. They had sensed the tunneling. And they were &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; angry. Mrsha began looking at the emergency hole. Numbtongue wiped sweat from his brow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Two more strikes. One—&lt;em&gt;two—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ceiling caved in a bit. Apista fluttered forwards. And Mrsha saw darkness. Light streamed down into the bee's cave. They looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then Mrsha heard the &lt;em&gt;thrumming.&lt;/em&gt; Numbtongue paused, pick poised to widen the hole. He backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The cave was filled with beating wings. Like distant thunder. And &lt;em&gt;rage&lt;/em&gt;—Mrsha saw the Hobgoblin whirl. His hand went to his belt as, inside, hundreds of dark shapes moved, streaming for the hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet—&lt;em&gt;no!&lt;/em&gt; Mrsha leapt. She tackled Numbtongue's belt as the Goblin poised to throw. He cursed, grabbing at her, preparing to dive off the roof. And then he saw them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bees! &lt;/em&gt;They swarmed upwards, pressing against the small hole in their prison. Freedom. &lt;em&gt;Freedom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But—Mrsha and Numbtongue, about to leap, saw something. The bees were pressing against the roof of the cave. Pulling dirt and stones upwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Blocking the hole. Numbtongue stared. Mrsha's jaw dropped. Didn't they want to be free? Apista flew around the hole, urgently. And Mrsha—sensed something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fury. Thousands of minds, working in concert. The queen of the Ashfire Bees was raging. They all were. But not against Mrsha, or Numbtongue, or Apista, or their prison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The intruders. They came from below. The knaves. They were wrong. Squirming. Wretched things, preying on the hive in the darkness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking to conquer. Thinking them weak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They could not escape. Slaughter them. Tear them to bits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.8em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suffer not the invaders. By the will of fire, kill them. What should not exist. Like the Crelers. Rip them to shreds. They could not be allowed to escape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better to die than to give way. Seal the light. Kill and kill again. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2.5em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No escape. Slaughter the knaves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 3em"&gt;Kill them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The thoughts beat against Mrsha. She could feel/hear/see them in the darkness. The foes! &lt;em&gt;Kill them! &lt;/em&gt;Do not let them &lt;em&gt;out!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bees were sealing the breach in their cave. Blocking it—generating wax along with the dirt. Numbtongue stared. He didn't know what was happening. Or why Apista was suddenly jabbing at the air, furious. He heard a rumble and looked down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha was &lt;em&gt;snarling&lt;/em&gt; in his arms. The Gnoll growled making a rumbling noise in her chest. Slowly, the [Bard] backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment, Mrsha was lost in the bee's thoughts. They lessened as she drew away from the cave. She looked around, blinked a few times, as Apista flew after her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee's thoughts were different. Mrsha no longer sensed Apista's sadness. Like her—the other bee had picked up on the trapped Hive's thoughts. Now—Apista was angry. Worried, but angry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bad things. Bad things in there.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue looked at the cave. He reached for his sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Crelers?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha and Apista shook their heads—well, Apista shook her entire body. Something &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;. Numbtongue felt a tingle running down his spine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not opening cave, then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No. Mrsha shook her head. And yet—she looked at the cave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bees were hungry. She had felt that too, beneath their all-consuming loathing of their foes. They were reproducing in the darkness, to replenish their losses. They could do that—fight in the dark, maintain their Hive. They had been hundreds strong, and they were &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; bees. They could slaughter a Silver-rank team in seconds if not prepared. They were killing all the…things coming up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But what they &lt;em&gt;lacked&lt;/em&gt; was food. The Hive had possessed deep honey reservoirs. But it had used up all of its reserves. They would have to start letting the weaker bees die, soon. They could not hold forever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apista felt her comrade's pain. So did Mrsha. Her eyes watered as she looked at the Hive, felt the cold resolve. Nor did she question their will. It was a certainty. Their foes were unnatural, like the Crelers. &lt;em&gt;Not meant to exist or move under the sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet—they had to be helped. Mrsha felt that too, strongly. She tried to communicate this all with Numbtongue. He, ignorant of all of it, tried to understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something bad in the cave. Not Crelers. Very bad. Seal the cave. But—hungry bees?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She and Apista nodded. Numbtongue sat on his haunches and thought. After a moment, he grabbed Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We leave."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The first thing Pyrite had shouted into his mind was that anything that animals were afraid of was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; something you wanted to be nearby. There were a few candidates on his list. And they were all bad. The Hobgoblin picked up the protesting Mrsha and towed her away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then he and Mrsha had a think. The bees were in danger. But even &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; thought they should be in the darkness. What did you do? Tell someone?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha was pretty sure the bees would kill anything in their cave. Even Numbtongue, or an adventuring team. And she didn't know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; was in there. Numbtongue, with a Goblin's practicality, refused to open the cave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So? Where did that leave them? Mrsha didn't know. She watched Apista sadly float down to a flower and suck up the nectar. Without the Ashfire Bees, smaller breeds of bees and butterflies were occupying the Floodplains. If only Mrsha could put the flowers in the cave. Then the bees would have food!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait.&lt;/em&gt; That was it! Mrsha raised her head! Put the magic door to the Garden into the cave!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue looked at Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;How would that even work? Mrsha had to admit, putting the magic door into the cave would allow whatever was inside into the garden. And Erin's Garden of Sanctuary wasn't the portal door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They thought again. Both Goblin and Gnoll stared at Apista. She floated to another flower. She wasn't really &lt;em&gt;hungry&lt;/em&gt;—she was storing the liquid, Mrsha felt. She got enough food each morning. From…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll urgently pulled on Numbtongue's arms. She pointed at Apista. And then she signed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What if—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bard] looked at Mrsha. He snapped his fingers, and then grinned. Mrsha anxiously pointed towards the inn. The Hobgoblin thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No problem. Tricky thing is Lyonette. We'll make a plan. Not too hard. Let's go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They hurried off. And about an hour later, in the inn, Lyonette du Marquin was distracted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bee attack! Oh dead gods!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apista zoomed through the air, attacking guests like an avenger of the skies. Lyonette saw her dive-bombing the regulars, landing in a mug—the [Princess] raced after Apista.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Apista! Stop! What's gotten into you!?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee refused to calm down. The [Princess] was so busy shouting and chasing after the bee as the patrons scattered that she never noticed Numbtongue and Mrsha stealing into the kitchen and basement respectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Got it?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue panted as he raced outside with the wheelbarrow. Mrsha nodded; she'd used the Garden of Sanctuary to spirit her goods outside. Now, she helped Numbtongue load the wheelbarrow with the sacks of sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They'd brought one of Erin's spare portal doors to the cave entrance. Numbtongue adjusted the magic door as he looked around quickly. He rolled the wheelbarrow through, and then two kegs of water that were now kept topped up from the well the Antinium had dug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha followed as Apista was finally captured. The bee waved her antennas furiously, wishing the best of luck to the Bee Rescue Team. It was in their feelers now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue got the barrels of water onto the cave's roof via the magical portal door. Mrsha kept watch, turning the magic door back to Liscor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, are you helping, Mrsha? Good job!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll waved at Drassi as she let through some Liscorians, and then a group from Esthelm who requested transfer to Wailant's farm—they were buying produce. Then she switched it back to the secret bee-cave entrance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue had a barrel of water open. He was pouring sugar into the water, sacks of it. The costly sugar was being mixed with the water to create—Apista food. Bee food. Mrsha nodded to him as he carefully rotated a barrel over to the opening in the cave's rooftop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She leapt through; they had ten minutes before Drassi checked the door again, and that was if no one wanted to go through! But Apista had bought them time with her chaos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Numbtongue grabbed the pickaxe and began smashing the hole he'd made, widening it. Mrsha sensed the bees growing furious again. Urgently, she waved a paw. Tried to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; her message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Not bad! Friends! Friends!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll shouted with her head. The bees—hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Peace of the Wild].&lt;/em&gt; They felt Mrsha's intent. And shot out of the hole. Numbtongue backed up &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; as they descended on the barrel. The bees began to feast on the sugary water. But there was too much of it for them to carry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pour it into the cave? No good."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bard] cursed as he saw the bees trying to lift the incredibly heavy barrel. They did not want the hole in the cave to remain long! Already—the enemy was coming, sensing the opening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mrsha stared into the cave. She saw something &lt;em&gt;moving&lt;/em&gt;—a flash of light as an Ashfire Bee ignited and burned it away. Cracks in the cave. She shuddered, then pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Barrel? I can't lower it. With a rope?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin frowned. Mrsha looked at the bees, covering the barrel. She slapped her forehead with one paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another barrel!&lt;/em&gt; They'd pour it into barrels from the ceiling! The Hobgoblin cursed as he realized she was right. He ran back into the inn as Mrsha anxiously stood guard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Numbtongue, where are you going with that barrel…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette spotted Numbtongue as he rolled one out of the basement. The Hobgoblin froze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Need it for mining?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh? Well…have you seen Mrsha? I'm wondering if she's up to mischief—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Princess] saw a white shape flash into the common room. Mrsha, panting, smiling innocently, grabbed her magic ball. Lyonette saw her raise it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mrsha…don't you dare throw—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll &lt;em&gt;hurled&lt;/em&gt; the ball as hard as she could. She brained one of the Players of Celum. Lyonette chased after Mrsha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You're in big trouble, missy!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apista took to the air again. Now, two of the Bee Rescue Team were down. And the third pillar of the team, Numbtongue, lowered two barrels into the cave. The bees actually moved them upright. And Numbtongue poured the sugar-water into the opening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was done. Messy, disorganized, and with two timeouts—but it was done. Numbtongue lay, panting in the hallway as he switched the magic door back to Liscor. Mrsha, pretending to apologize and be sorry, raised one ear as the Hobgoblin poked his head into the common room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raised a single thumb and nodded at them. Apista, tethered by a piece of string to the windowsill in her timeout, saluted with one antenna. Mrsha beamed, and then went back to being scolded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission accomplished.&lt;/em&gt; The bees had their food. The queen was already making room for more larvae. And the brave Bee Rescue Team's heroics might go unnoticed by all but the bees, but that was their job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Honestly. I don't know what gets into you all sometimes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lyonette sighed. Erin Solstice walked back into her inn and yawned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, I'm back! What's with all the fuss?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin! You just missed Mrsha and Apista making a fuss. I think we need to send them to the Strongheart's farm to run about. Can you take them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure! I delivered my sandwich."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean, that abomination? Wait—do you think it'll sell tonight?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure! I'll make another. Relc'll buy it. Hey, Numbtongue. Why are you all sweaty?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Barrels."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Hobgoblin sat at a table. He wanted lunch. Erin looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Barrels? Uh—okay then. Barrels to you too. What did you do, Mrsha? Let me just make some cookies to replenish our stocks and then I'll take you to Wailant and Viceria's! You can run about all day there!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She walked into the kitchen. The Bee Rescue Team heard Erin rummaging about. Then she went into the basement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lyonette? Why are we out of sugar?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bee, the Goblin, and Mrsha looked at each other. They casually got up and strolled, or flew into the Garden of Sanctuary. If they had sunglasses, they'd have put them on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their work here was done.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And in the darkness, the bees fought against the things coming up. The things that did not belong. They came, squirming through the cracks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the dungeon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Druid Level 7!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Skill – Ambient Mana Gatherer obtained!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Free Antinium's Hive was in the midst of change. And that was not a superficial word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belgrade stared at the necklace. It &lt;em&gt;shone&lt;/em&gt;. And when he touched it—his body blurred. A few fake Belgrades appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Locket of Mirror Images. Yes. This is yours. And you will take other artifacts as needed. You, Anand. This wand is for you. And for you…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pawn stood in the Painted Antinium's barracks. He was handing out magical items. The other Antinium were staring in awe at the illusory Belgrades. But Pawn had &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; magical items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They are for us? And this ring…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yellow Splatters tried it on. The ring should not have fit his hands; it had been too small. But it fit on, perfectly.  Pawn nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Two artifacts for each Individual. That is what Xrn has promised me. You are all allowed one defensive artifact and an offensive one. Good ones, not disposable wands like before."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For us? But the cost of each item must be…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What cost? You are all Antinium capable of leveling. This is the least that should be afforded to you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice. The Antinium turned. And Xrn stood in front of them. Her eyes shone with pleasure. Pawn looked past her, at a figure who stood at ease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Klbkch. He didn't object to Xrn passing out the Hive's treasures. A few of the other Antinium following Xrn did, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"These are not Prognugators. This is a waste of resources. I object, Prognugator Xrn—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The azure Antinium raised her staff threateningly. Pivr flinched. He and the other foreign Antinium watched as Pawn handed Purple Smiles his necklace. The Small Queen smiled as the other Antinium looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Be silent, Pivr. The power to level was rare even among the Antinium of old. It is worth safeguarding. And each one is precious. Not that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; seemed to understand this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Klbkch and raised her staff. The other Centenium didn't flinch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was my determination, Xrn. Erin Solstice was capable of making more, and the discipline issues—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Fool.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn brought down her staff on Klbkch's head. She shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We cannot expect the same Antinium. Discipline? Perhaps that is what &lt;em&gt;makes&lt;/em&gt; Individuals. They are closer to Centenium than regular true Antinium. The Centenium disobeyed because they were made to think autonomously."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Klbkch stirred at the comparison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They are &lt;em&gt;not—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His mandibles snapped shut as Xrn threatened to hit him with her staff again. The Small Queen turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Erin Solstice will accommodate some patrols. And all Antinium will visit her inn. We may have to bring the Silent Antinium and other varieties to her inn…carefully. Perhaps with illusion spells. The Armored Antinium will serve for now, without their armor. Dekass, Tersk, you are in charge of that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded. The two Prognugators bowed. Pawn stared at Xrn. She was radiant. And she was giving the Hive everything he had wanted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Prognugator Xrn. What will we do, the Painted Antinium?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled, raising her mandibles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some will go to other Hives. They will be needed. Perhaps you, Pawn. As emissaries in turn. But the Hives are joined. There are—issues affecting some. Battles to be fought. You will be deployed, but you must live. To level. To become stronger."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium stirred, hearing her words. Seeing Xrn look at them. For the Small Queen was inspirational. She &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And still—Klbkch watched. He felt as though a weight he had not known was there was taken off his shoulders. Xrn could lead the Antinium. She was generous; he would never have given artifacts to ordinary Antinium except in times of war.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Xrn would. And if she had a single flaw, it was that she didn't know other species as he did. He had heard of her trying to convince Erin. Everything Klbkch understood of Erin told him Xrn's offering thousands of gold pieces to Erin wouldn't work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet here they were. And more Antinium stood in the Hive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silent Antinium.&lt;/em&gt; Their forms were the most alien, along with that of the Flying Antinium. They had scythes for arms—their cutting power unmatched. And their bodies were blending with the dirt walls, camouflaging automatically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Free Antinium stared at these…strangers. As foreign to them as Antinium were to regular people. They had no idea that Antinium could be like this. That they were the same people was…odd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. It will take some getting used to. The Antinium must fight together. The Hives are always separate. But &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will be a beginning. I have a plan to strengthen the Free Hive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn struck the ground lightly. And Tersk shifted. Pivr moved his wings, uncertain, and the Prognugator of the Silent Antinium adjusted her posture. Xrn was &lt;em&gt;supporting&lt;/em&gt; the Free Hive. It was unsettling the other Hives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the Free Antinium had much to offer. Xrn waved her staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come. We do not have time to &lt;em&gt;waste.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A few minutes later, the Free Queen inspected the pair of Flying Antinium standing before her. And the collection of bodies on the floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Armored Antinium. Two corpses of Silent Antinium. And—a variety of forms from the Flying Queen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corpses.&lt;/em&gt; They had been brought via bags of holding. And they were neatly arranged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pivr, Tersk, Dekass, and the Silent Antinium's Prognugator, Xeu, stood in front of her. They were presenting their offerings. They had come once before—not Xeu, but just a few of the regular Silent Antinium to inspect the Hive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That time they had been rude, condescending. This time—they offered gifts. Oh, how the fortunes changed. And partly, mostly, because of Bird.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gifts, Free Queen of the Antinium. These forms the Silent Queen presents. For your study. Dissection."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xeu spoke. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; was well-crafted. The Silent Queen, the best shaper among the Queens, had put a lot of effort into her form. The Free Queen saw any number of improvements. She nodded slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The gift is well-received. And the corpses from the other queens?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For her to study and learn from. Tersk and Dekass bowed their heads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Likewise, Free Queen. We also present armor for your Painted Antinium."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. For the Soldiers. It will be used. The Armored Queen is generous. But what of these living Antinium? Pivr. Speak."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Prognugator of the Flying Antinium spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"These are her Majesty's exceedingly generous gifts—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He broke off as a cart trundled past him. The Flying Antinium, his body elongated, closer to quadruped than bipedal, with long wings—recoiled as a Worker slowly moved forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Garry. He was pushing a cart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have snacks for the guests. Acid fly tarts, a sour soup—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They may partake of it later, Garry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Free Queen saw all the other Prognugator's heads turning as Garry nodded and began setting up a table. Xeu's mandibles opened and closed. Tersk and Dekass looked excited. Pivr just stared. After a moment, he went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Flying Queen has sent not only her numerous forms to study, Free Queen, but two of our brood. Here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed at the two Flying Antinium standing with the dead. The Free Queen hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For what purpose?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Live vivisection, of course. Corpses only have so much merit in understanding their function. It is a sign of the Flying Queen's will."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other Prognugators stirred. There was a &lt;em&gt;crash&lt;/em&gt; as Garry slipped in setting up his dishes. All heads turned again. And the Free Queen looked at the two Flying Antinium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vivisection.&lt;/em&gt; Of course, that was how she would learn more from living examples. It was generous—although tainted by the Flying Queen's self-importance. She had so many different forms for her Antinium because they were all flawed. Even Pivr, one of her best works, couldn't fly so much as jump and glide for long stretches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Still—there was achievement in her numerous experiments. The Armored Queen didn't do &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; modifications by comparison. Her Soldiers were almost identical to the Free Queen's. But she had so much armor and weaponry; she had invested in that instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Silent Queen had few Antinium, but each one was a masterpiece. The Free Queen knew she would learn the most from her peer. Yet—something bothered her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Vivisection?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Garry stared at the two Flying Antinium. The [Chef] was already nervous in the presence of the foreign Prognugators. But he couldn't help but let the word slip out. They would be—killed? Torn apart to see how they worked?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had been in amazingly high spirits. The Free Queen had been kind to him of late. She had learned his name, given him vacations—even if he'd eaten the sour cheese and wasted some gold—and with Xrn's return, he had truly felt things were better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He would even be allowed to study with Erin and help with her cooking one day each week so long as he stocked the kitchen with food for the Free Queen to consume while he was gone. What more could you &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this disturbed the [Chef]. The other Antinium would die. He looked at the Flying Antinium that Pivr had so casually offered to death. Wondering what they thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They barely moved as they stood at attention. Like Pivr, they were more like…flies, than ants. Both were made for war. One was a Worker-type, the other a Soldier-type. And yet—while they lived and they were both functionally capable of thought and action, even without direction—Garry saw nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not brain-death. Just—emptiness. Nothingness. A resignation. &lt;em&gt;They would die&lt;/em&gt;. It was the look he had seen in other Workers sent to fight when the Hive was invaded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It hurt Garry. Because he knew that feeling. Before he had met Erin, he had lived it. A life without hope. You could walk into a storm of arrows because there was nothing to fear. Nothing to live for, but the Hive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they were going to be killed. For knowledge. To benefit the Hive. All of that made sense. But it was &lt;em&gt;wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Chef] looked at his Queen. And he saw she was troubled. A month ago, she would have happily picked apart the two Antinium right there and then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But a change had come over the Hive. And perhaps—perhaps, yes, none more pronounced than the Free Queen herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For she looked at the two Antinium she would vivisect. And for a moment—they both looked like Bird. And she wondered if, given the chance, they could sing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a terrible thing for a Queen to have. Compassion for her Workers and Soldiers. But it was there. Still—the Free Queen was a soldier of the Antinium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I thank you, Pivr. I will begin my studies."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She felt the two Flying Antinium under her control. Pivr rubbed two feeler-legs together, smiling. And Garry could not bear it. He stumbled forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um! My Queen! Might I ask that they be given to me? Not killed? Vivisected?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All heads turned. Pivr's mandibles opened and dropped at the effrontery. Xeu stirred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aberration…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of her scythe-blades moved and Garry froze in fear. The Free Queen raised a feeler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. He is permitted to give his opinion. His rank is…unique. Speak, Garry. You would take both Flying Antinium? Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So that they would not die? Garry's mind raced. He looked around desperately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could—use them? My Queen, they would be invaluable in…cooking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As food?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pivr stared. Garry shook his head rapidly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, as assistants. I am sure their live…dissection…would provide much benefit to the Hive. But perhaps they might aid cooking more. I'm uh, uh—I am working on a vertical storage system and—&lt;em&gt;height-based cuisine&lt;/em&gt;! Like layer cakes. So high I cannot reach them myself. These…samples would be exceptional aides to me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Free Queen sat back. She looked at Garry thoughtfully. And then she waved a feeler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is indeed a very important task, Garry. And as Free Queen, I accept. The Flying Queen's gift will be put to invaluable use. You have my thanks twice, Pivr."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Flying Prognugator looked uncertain. So did Garry. The two Flying Antinium looked at him. Their…boss. And he had no idea how he would use them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he saw something in their gazes. And it too was familiar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the darkness, there was a light. &lt;em&gt;Hope&lt;/em&gt;, such as what Erin had once given him with a chessboard. Garry bowed to his Queen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only Pivr was uncertain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But is this food—layer cakes? Is this truly better than their use as my Queen intended? I may disagree—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dekass looked at Pivr. Sternly, the Armored Prognugator raised one finger and shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Be quiet. Food is very important. You do not fully understand. Yet. We must show you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed at Garry's spread of food. The other Prognugators looked. Pivr scuttled over to the table, grabbed a tart and nibbled. He froze and then began to &lt;em&gt;gobble&lt;/em&gt;. Xeu appeared at the table and stared at the sour soup. She picked up a bowl cautiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Garry found his first apprentices had wings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the darkness of the dungeon, Earlia of Gemhammer lifted her lantern and gasped. Her heart was pounding. She held the warhammer in both of her hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was sweating. She'd been cut twice—deeply, by claws. But her armor was thick and the cuts weren't deep. The combat had been fierce. But brief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rest of her team was panting as well. They'd charged their foes—and the team of former [Miners] all had strength Skills and heavy weapons. They hadn't been unprepared however; their opponents had arrows buried in their fur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nailren's team. The Pride of Kelia had joined with her team for the dungeon explorations. The two Silver-rank teams couldn't advance as fast as, say, the Wings of Pallass, or the Flamewardens. The other Gold-ranks teams were securing much more of the dungeon day by day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And fortunes were being made down here. Bounties for monster parts—even some treasure was being found. At last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At last, the risk was paying off.&lt;/em&gt; And Earlia saw—from the glow of the mining lantern at her side—something that made her heart pound wildly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An adventurer's dream. The dead Raskghar team that had run into the two adventuring parties had been hard to put down. One of Earlia's companions spat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods. They &lt;em&gt;stink!&lt;/em&gt; This one—eurgh! It's all ragged. Fur's falling out! Are they &lt;em&gt;sick? &lt;/em&gt;Keep back from the bodies! Shield your faces! I heard someone in the Lifwail Blades got ill after a fight with them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other adventurers nodded. The Raskghar, one of the threats of the dungeon hadn't been completely wiped out after the battle with them. But they'd been forced back. At first, the adventurers had suffered counterattacks on full moons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;However, the Raskghar patrols had become far weaker. And these ones—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Raskghar had a festering wound it hadn't taken during the fighting. Earlia felt her nose and stomach protesting as she got closer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, Captain! I said—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I heard you, Timgal. Shut it. I think…I think I just found some treasure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rest of Gemhammer looked up sharply as Earlia bent. On the Raskghar's finger, amid the fur was a glint of metal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A band of gold, and something shining blue. Earlia recognized it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn me. That's high-quality sapphire right there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone had expertly inlaid it with the gold. Earlia's heart pounded as she reached down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Knife."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Instantly, Blaik produced one. He put it into her hand and she sawed at the finger. Grisly. But the finger came off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So did the ring. Earlia was almost sure it wasn't cursed. Her team stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is it enchanted, Captain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think so. Remember how this one came at us? It had something on its fur. Like armor made of &lt;em&gt;water&lt;/em&gt;. This might—be an armor enchantment. We'll have to get it tested, but—search the other bodies!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A magic ring. The others instantly investigated the corpses. Carefully—holding cloths over their noses and avoiding touching the sores or other marks of infection. Earlia was going to wash herself three times when she got out of the dungeon and make her team do the same. She pulled at the ring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was another exclamation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;This Raskghar has a bunch of gemstones in the bag! Captain!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What!?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A woman turned. Fea waved the bag at the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All of em cut! It looks like they pulled them off the walls. See? It's got a bit of masonry here. And—&lt;em&gt;dead gods!&lt;/em&gt; They're high-quality!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nailren! We've found &lt;em&gt;treasure!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Earlia shouted eagerly. The Gnoll team covering their backs while the dead were searched turned. Nailren called out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really? What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magical ring! Bag of gemstones—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And a knife! Looks enchanted!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Shrapnel found a knife in one of the Raskghar's hands. Earlia whistled. If they hadn't been so uncharacteristically weak, they might have done a lot of damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That settles it. We're getting out of here! We're making for the entrance! Nailren, we've hit the jackpot!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A quiet cheer went up from both teams. Earlia was grinning—until she heard one of her teammates cough. She whirled—and saw Blaik grinning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just a prank, Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stow that shit! Or we'll leave you behind! We're going to scrub ourselves clean with soap and get checked at the [Healer]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rest of Gemhammer punched the former [Miner], enraged by the prank. Blaik threw up his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's just a joke!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Quiet! We're not behind the barricades yet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nailren had to order Earlia's team to be quiet. But his Gnolls were excited too. Earlia shushed her team as he took point, leading them back the way they'd come. This was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. Her heart was pounding. It was actually the gemstones that were worth the most at the moment. The ring might be valuable, and so might the knife, but they were two objects and Earlia's entire team—and Nailren's—had a claim to the treasure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But those gems were &lt;em&gt;fat&lt;/em&gt; and high-quality! They'd more than justify a week of adventuring. And—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two teams were nearly back at the barricades. And perhaps they'd let their guards down. That was when most adventurers died. It wasn't the first ambush that got you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was always the one you weren't prepared for. They were turning a corner and walking down a tunnel that had been cleared; the two traps were clearly marked. That was when Nailren held up a paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He whispered. The other Silver-rank adventurers froze. They stared ahead. Earlia, grabbing at her warhammer, saw nothing at first. Until—she saw the little head peeking around the corner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Goblin's head. It was staring, wide-eyed—far away. Unblinking. Earlia felt her mouth dry up at once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;If you didn't know, you'd think it was just a Goblin. Until you realized the head was unnaturally placed. Low to the ground, peeking out, shaking a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Goblin's eyes never blinked. Because the head was dead. It was on a stick. And what was holding it was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh no. No, &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt; Not now. Dead gods."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Gnolls in Kelia's Pride began to moan. Nailren aimed his bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Facestealer.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The adventurers whispered. A name that had circulated through their ranks. And Earlia felt something walking on her grave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A guardian of this dungeon. It had only ever appeared twice. Both times—the team had been found headless. Once, a Silver-rank team. The second, a Gold-rank duo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, no, no, no—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Quiet! Spread out! Retreat along the corridor we just came down! Send an emergency [Message] spell at &lt;em&gt;once!&lt;/em&gt; To all Gold-rank teams!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nailren ordered. Both Silver-rank teams ran back down the corridor. Nailren loosed an arrow and then turned and ran.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The corridor they'd come down was long, and wide. A perfect place &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be trapped in. The teams spread out as far as they could.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It paralyzes everything in range. That's what the notes say. We just have to buy time. Help is on the way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Earlia gritted her teeth. Her team looked at her. No one believed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Eyes forwards and back! Loose an arrow—slow it down!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nailren was shouting, ignoring the rule for silence. Other monsters might be a blessing at a time like this. The other adventurers peered around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see it! &lt;em&gt;I see it!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Earlia whirled as someone shouted. She saw a head disappear around a corner as a Gnoll [Archer] loosed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then—two heads popped back. One was a Raskghar's face. The other—Earlia recoiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human.&lt;/em&gt; The face stared at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that—Tessa?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Shrapnel whispered. The other adventurers stared at the Gold-rank adventurer's face. Someone began to moan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fea! &lt;em&gt;Shut up!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Earlia ordered her friend, but Fea's fear was contagious. The heads bobbed. Then a third face joined it. The Goblin's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They wiggled, moving up and down. And then—&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; leaned around the corner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Facestealer had no face himself. No head or neck. The huge, lumpen figure had two indentations in its chest. Nothing above it. It held the heads on crude sticks as it &lt;em&gt;peeked&lt;/em&gt; at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tribes save us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nailren whispered. He aimed his bow, loosed an arrow. Facestealer disappeared before the arrow could strike it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's &lt;em&gt;fast.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't retreat! Spread out. Buy time. Send another [Message]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Was anyone coming? Had they—left them for dead? Earlia's hands shook as she lifted her warhammer. She remembered the ring and fumbled for it. Maybe it would help? Better to be cursed than die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's &lt;em&gt;coming&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The heads were wobbling as they appeared around the corner. Moving faster and faster. &lt;em&gt;Jiggling &lt;/em&gt;obscenely. Earlia could sense Facestealer building momentum. Faster and faster they moved. Then they vanished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I don't want…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Earlia found the ring in her cold fingers. She stared ahead as a shape &lt;em&gt;blurred&lt;/em&gt; around the corner. It was &lt;em&gt;too fast.&lt;/em&gt; Too &lt;em&gt;big—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;—-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman opened her eyes. She was lying on the ground. She didn't understand at first. But then she realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was lying on her side. Her team lay around her. Scattered though they were around the corridor, it hadn't mattered. Earlia saw Nailren, staring, eyes wide, next to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both teams had been paralyzed. And behind Nailren—Facestealer. It had stopped after catching them with its magical effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was standing over them. Huge, powerful arms. Clawed…fingers? No head. Just a rounded hump on top of its body. The two gaping pits in its chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And a bag. Stained with blood and grime. It was looking at them. At their heads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. No! Not when they were so close! Not now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone was sobbing. Crying like a child. Earlia realized it was her. And more voices joined hers. Fea was crying too. Someone was pleading for their lives. Facestealer walked among the adventurers. Bending, &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Choosing which one to pick. It was bending for Nailren as the Gnoll &lt;em&gt;snarled&lt;/em&gt;. Then Facestealer paused. It turned. And Earlia felt something running through the floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thwoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The explosion ran through the dungeon. An impact so loud it drowned out her racing heart. Facestealer hesitated. And the guardian of Liscor's dungeon felt it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Deep within the dungeon, a figure made of metal held eternal court. Suits of enchanted armor, ancient guardians, moved in the darkness. Leading patrols, repairing their broken comrades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Armored General led them. And it too felt the tremor. Slowly, it turned its head. Cobwebs and dust moved as it changed its posture. The enchanted armor turned. Slowly, they began to march in the direction of the attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So did Facestealer. It abandoned the adventurers. Something was blaring a silent alarm only it and the other protectors of this place could hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invasion.&lt;/em&gt; Not one adventurer, or even a few. And on a scale that had only occurred once, nearly eight years ago. The dungeon woke &lt;em&gt;up.&lt;/em&gt; Monsters streamed towards the enemy, ordered to battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They died. The shadows themselves hacked them apart. Rows of armored foes crushed them. And flying, winged figures leapt through the tunnels. And the Antinium flooded over Flesh Worms, tore apart the enchanted patrols of armor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Thousands of them. It was a full-scale attack! The dungeon threw wave after wave at the Antinium. It had crushed them before! And even the thousand-strong attack waves only killed monsters. The Antinium would die. They would—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…They weren't stopping. Nor were the traps or monsters holding them back. Something was wrong. Silent Antinium were moving ahead, &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; the concealed traps both magical and mundane! And the Armored Antinium were fighting equally, no, better than the enchanted suits of armor. The flying Antinium were too fast, flanking and overwhelming their opponents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Painted Antinium were marching with the regular Soldiers and Workers. As a group of exploding caterpillars swarmed down a tunnel, a [Priest] raised his censer. And a wall of light blocked the monsters as they detonated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Advance! Injured Soldiers, fall back!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yellow Splatters ripped off the head off a Face-Eater moth. Anand was rotating Antinium out, predicting attacks and saving lives as Antinium retreated in the face of ambushes and attacks. Ahead of them, Tersk was leading a squad of Armored Antinium with &lt;em&gt;shields&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They calmly advanced through a party of undead skeleton archers raining arrows on them. The Antinium were covered in steel from head to toe; when they reached the skeletons and ghouls they demolished their opponents without so much as a scratch. The Flesh Worm &lt;em&gt;snatched&lt;/em&gt; at them, but it couldn't tear their chitin off with the armor in the way. And the Armored Antinium had blades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Spit acid! Wear them down!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pivr chittered as his group swarmed forwards. Some of the Flying Antinium were spitting venom or acidic liquids. The globules burst among a group of Face-Eater Moths filling a tunnel. And the Silent Antinium had beheaded a group of Raskghar without the powerful not-Gnolls even so much as striking a blow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactics. Utility. &lt;/em&gt;Yellow Splatters saw how each Antinium group filled the weaknesses of the others. And the Painted Antinium—Pawn was healing one of the wounded Soldiers who had a chunk missing from his armor. And Yellow Splatters himself ran at a suit of enchanted armor and knocked it flying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;However, even this wouldn't have been enough. The dungeon was coming alive. And a &lt;em&gt;wave&lt;/em&gt; of Shield Spiders barreled down one tunnel. So many that they would have smashed even the Antinium. But today, the Antinium weren't alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Motionless Vortex]. Klbkchhezeim. Will you take care of them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It would be my pleasure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Shield Spiders hit something in the air. Something that stopped their momentum, even the giant Shield Spider pushing the rest. And the Shield Spiders saw a figure, standing in the tunnel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alone. Slimmer than the rest. And he had two silvery swords. Klbkch spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Recaptured Sublimity].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He disappeared. The first ranks of Shield Spiders did too. Klbkch's swords flashed in an arc. Silver afterimages. He began cutting the Shield Spiders apart. The floor began to run with yellow ichor. And the Shield Spiders realized the flaw in their wave-tactics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They couldn't run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How beautiful. He has something of his past power."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn watched as Klbkch advanced and the Shield Spiders began to scream. She turned her head as a [Tactician] spoke timidly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Centenium Xrn—we have secured eight tunnels so far. Your orders?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Begin your fortifications, Belgrade. Set up your traps at the choke points, as we discussed. I will continue leading the advance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen raised her staff. Lights bloomed along the tunnels, dazzling her enemies. But her allies just saw the gentle light, illuminating the darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had ordered the attack into the dungeon. The Small Queen walked forwards as another Antinium found her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Centenium—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You may call me 'Aunt', Anand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The azure Antinium corrected the [Tactician] mildly. Anand hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There is a push from the west. Facestealer and &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of the enchanted armor. They are filling two tunnels. Should we fall back?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why? Belgrade must set up his traps. After all—I intend to set up our fortifications in the dungeon. Far better to fight on enemy grounds. And the tunnels are impossible to breach. All we must do is push them back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Tactician] knew this made sense. But Anand opened and closed his mandibles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yet the dungeon's opposition is powerful—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And? Stay here with Klbkchhezeim. I will deal with this Facestealer. And the armor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alone?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen walked past ranks of Antinium. She smiled. And her eyes lit up. Rosy red and blooming silver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am never alone. And there is one thing you do not understand, Anand. Klbkchhezeim has lost his levels and his form. We Centenium were never of the highest level to begin with, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Anand saw Xrn turn. And her staff began to glow. The Centenium replied as she walked down the hallway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because our bodies were made too well. Our foes were too easy. I was made for &lt;em&gt;magic. &lt;/em&gt;Do you think the Centenium were just a word? &lt;em&gt;Watch.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She came to a corridor that split into two. And there, coming down the hallways was a line of metal. Hundreds of suits of armor, animated to defend this place. Overrunning the Antinium falling back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Facestealer. Plucking the heads off a squad of Painted Antinium and regular Soldiers who lay helpless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn's eyes flashed. Facestealer looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So. You are this Facestealer who has killed so many of my people. And you are the defenders of this place. &lt;em&gt;Come. &lt;/em&gt;You pathetic things."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The guardian of the dungeon straightened. It walked at Xrn. The suits of armor began to charge. The Centenium held her ground. She pointed at the hallway filled by the army of magical constructs and spoke a spell. Then she turned and looked at Facestealer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[The Bindings of Belavierr]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Glowing lines of light burst from the ground and walls, the ceiling. Black thread. They engulfed Facestealer, wrapping around his arms, legs, torso—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The monster halted. Xrn studied it, disappointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that all you can do? &lt;em&gt;Show me.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pawn, sprinting forwards to reinforce Xrn, with the Painted Antinium, including Chesacre, Thaina, and Purple Smile, suddenly fell flat on his face. He realized something was immobilizing him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No—Facestealer! [Heal Minor Wounds]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Priest] desperately tried to rise. None of the other Antinium were moving. He sensed something moving in the darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undead&lt;/em&gt;, coming down another corridor. The [Priest] whispered. &lt;em&gt;A prayer.&lt;/em&gt; It came from the other Antinium, silent though they might be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The binding on him—faded. It was a magical thing. But Pawn felt a different power enveloping him, forcing the effect back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Ghouls descending on the helpless Antinium saw the [Priest] holding his censer up. And there was light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Holy Radiance]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead saw the light blooming. And as it struck them—they screamed. Retreated, fled, as their flesh began to vaporize. Burst into flame. They &lt;em&gt;ran. &lt;/em&gt;Pawn shakily looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium were still frozen. But—the paralysis was waning? He saw Chesacre moving her two good arms. Pawn looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stay there! I'll find Facestealer! Stop it from advancing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He ran. Purple Smiles, lying on his front, observed in his head that Pawn's instructions to them really weren't necessary. Pawn ran to the next corridor. He saw a familiar person standing there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xrn. &lt;/em&gt;She was regarding a figure, struggling amid black bindings. Facestealer &lt;em&gt;tore&lt;/em&gt; one arm free, ripping loose half a dozen of the black lengths of thread ensnaring his arm. But more wrapped around him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that really all? [Paralysis]? How weak. How insignificant."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen raised her staff. Pawn saw a flash. The radiance and explosion was followed by a &lt;em&gt;kick&lt;/em&gt; of force that blasted behind Xrn with a rush of air. The [Priest] went skidding down the corridor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[The Light of Shali'vere]. My spells have no form. I create magic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen was aiming her staff at Facestealer. It was writhing—the explosion of light had blasted off its first layer of…hide. Pawn saw yellowed bone beneath. &lt;em&gt;Blood.&lt;/em&gt; He stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Facestealer tore more bindings away, desperate, enraged. Xrn saw it making its way at her, snapping the bindings. She tsked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mindless. Klbkchhezeim's body would make fighting you a challenge. But Wrymvr would enjoy the brawl. I would not. [Lesser Teleport]. [Acid Wave]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The monster &lt;em&gt;blinked&lt;/em&gt; out of existence. Pawn saw Facestealer appear fifty paces &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; down the corridor. The bindings raced at it again. And green acid surged down the hallway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It &lt;em&gt;steamed&lt;/em&gt; where it came into contact with the guardian. Xrn waved her staff and the magical acid, rather than obeying the laws of gravity, surged around the monster. Enveloping it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are difficult to kill, aren't you? &lt;em&gt;[Ailendamus' Lancearrows].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Long, magical arrows appeared in the air and blasted down the corridors. Copies of power. They struck Facestealer. The guardian &lt;em&gt;rocked&lt;/em&gt;. Its bones refused to crack, but it stumbled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it &lt;em&gt;tore&lt;/em&gt; at the acid surrounding it. Tore at the bindings. Flailing. Xrn blasted it with another spell. And she was smiling. Pawn saw the lights in her eyes shining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But what about the armor? An entire army of—the [Priest] whirled. And he saw, as his squad rejoined him, what had happened to the corridor full of enchanted suits of armor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The hallway &lt;em&gt;rippled&lt;/em&gt; with heat. The very air was distorted. But there was no flame. Just pure heat. Perfectly contained. Pawn saw a melting suit of steel staggering at him. The thick metal was…dripping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Running down the construct's body, as it melted. And it was so hot the steel was &lt;em&gt;vaporizing.&lt;/em&gt; Pawn stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The hallway was filled with melted metal. Hands, reaching out of the pools of metal—helmets, glowing, deforming. He slowly reached towards the rippling air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do not. Your hand will burst into flame. Or simply melt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn stopped Pawn. He whirled. The Small Queen stood behind him. Smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Facestealer. Was it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Gone. It was difficult to kill. And it tore free of my binding spell. A pity. It is not a threat so long as I see it, but it is stubborn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen nodded down the corridor. Pawn saw dissolving black bindings. Xrn regarded the corridor filled with metal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps the Armored Antinium can do something with this. Oh well. Was that the best the dungeon has to offer? Perhaps it grows more dangerous further in."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She waved her staff and the heat spell vanished. Pawn saw the glowing pools of metal slowly cooling. And he felt the incredible heat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn stood in the corridor. The squad of Antinium who'd come to…help, stood a bit uselessly. The Painted Antinium, Purple Smile, all of them looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think we have claimed enough of the dungeon. We will advance. Slowly. I am not incautious. And this dungeon is vast. My seeking spells tell me there is far, far too much ground to cover. The adventurers have claimed a good portion as well, but there is so much more to occupy. And my magic is not infinite. I am tired."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xrn kindly told the others. Pawn nodded slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Centenium Xrn—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You may call me &lt;em&gt;Aunt&lt;/em&gt;, Pawn. If you wish."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen smiled. Pawn did not wish. He looked at Xrn's shining eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Centenium, why do you need &lt;em&gt;us?&lt;/em&gt; We have nothing like your power."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was worth ten thousand Antinium. More. What were the Painted Antinium compared to her? What was anyone? The Small Queen laughed, a fluttering chirp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, little Pawn. That is true. But I was created to be the world's finest. And—I am only &lt;em&gt;one.&lt;/em&gt; There are so few of us left. I can still die. Klbkch has died and lost his power. Think of it. I can destroy one army of Drakes. But they have more than one. I need you, little Antinium. You must be stronger. Because only together can we triumph."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around fondly. And then the blackness surfaced in her eyes again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Small as you are, weak as you are. Together, we might triumph. We need &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of the Painted Antinium. A flood, to traverse the seas. To fight our true foe on Rhir. So do not think I can triumph alone. I have died once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She touched her chest. Pawn saw her eyes flicker darker still. And her head turned to him. She stared at the [Priest].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"On that day, over half of the Centenium marched with our First Queen, who created us. The closest being to perfection in this world. The highest level any Antinium ever achieved. Over half of us, and I was strong then as I am now. And we were wiped out to the last."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes were swimming black. A single spark of silver shone in the depths, like some moving pupil. Xrn looked up. And her staff rose and the dungeon's ceiling &lt;em&gt;shook&lt;/em&gt; as she cast a spell upwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt;. And let us take back our home. That is why I am here. Level—and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Pawn. And her eyes began to return to normal. Something like playfulness emerged in her voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps we will find the key to the death of our foe here after all. Let us go back, Pawn. And you will conjure more of this delightful bread for me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Small Queen turned away. And the dungeon shook. Facestealer fled. The armored guardians had been humbled. But they were just guardians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lesser ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet, the Small Queen walked in radiance and remembered glory. Bringing change to the Antinium. Preparing for the war that had never stopped for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the end of the most ordinary, uneventful sort of day. With nothing but the quiet boredom, the passing of days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was not as interesting as the events the world took note of. And it passed into evening. The end, with nothing to remark on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf turned over the mithril coin in his fingers and thought of how hard it would be to move, the benefits of such things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Ashfire Bees fought in the darkness, given life by the little Druid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Apista got high just because she wanted to, and not because she was depressed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Montressa and Bezale discovered just how much gold was going to the Golden Triangle and got a bit more worried as they filed their reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Antinium followed the Small Queen as she sat in Erin's inn and introduced some of the Armored Antinium to the young woman. Erin in turn introduced the Meat Supreme Sub to the world and Relc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bird daydreamed of the time he'd flown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Garry had two new assistants he was teaching how to mix dough to, who followed their savior, their champion, and looked at him like he looked at Erin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Small things. And the last of these unrelated events began with a horse, carrying a young woman. Her hair was black and red, like embers amid darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had reached a city. And the sprawling metropolis made her smile, as she dismounted. People stared, for the young [Lady] caught the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She burned, like the last spark in the darkness. Brightest, before it went out. Lady Maviola El fell into line with the people entering Invrisil, the City of Adventurers. She had little gold, only a few possessions, and three vials of worth beyond compare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On a last adventure. As she waited, along one of the many gates leading towards the city, she wondered what the future held. She saw a [Farmer], bringing in food for the city's many shops and places of business. And a group fell in behind her, arguing noisily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're going to shoot all of us. Ksmvr, don't you dare say anything. Leave the talking to us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Captain Ceria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Leave the talking to &lt;em&gt;me. &lt;/em&gt;You mean, oh glorious Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. Remember what happened last time?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Last time&lt;/em&gt; you said 'let's all have a second helping of eggs! It can't hurt!' Which is why we're so late!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pisces. Don't talk to me about the eggs. Otherwise it's gonna come out again. I still feel sick. And I don't know which end it's coming out—Ksmvr, hand me your Amulet of Food Poisoning."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Captain Ceria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All three of you, stay away from me. You're all a disgrace to adventurers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola's lips twitched. She turned her head and then stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A half-Elf was grabbing for an amulet being held out by an Antinium. One of her hands was skeletal—just bone. A [Necromancer] was sniffing haughtily. And a woman with &lt;em&gt;metallic&lt;/em&gt; arms was rolling her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola blinked at the half-Elf and Yvlon Byres, and then&lt;em&gt; smoldered &lt;/em&gt;at the Antinium. The adventurers took no notice of her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were sitting on a wagon. And on that wagon was…a door. The arguing team, the Horns of Hammerad, had the door propped up. Maviola eyed them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At least we're here. Say, do you think we'll be able to get to The Wandering Inn today?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Probably not. You know how that door is. Only two of us will probably be able to go through, at most. Dibs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dibs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn it, you two."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yvlon scowled. Ksmvr raised one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am 'dibbing' disqualifying myself to allow my teammates to go and visit the inn before me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other adventurers blinked at him. And they slowly drew closer to the city. The [Lady] eyed them as Ceria wrinkled her nose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's that smell?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Every head turned. And—somehow you missed this, but everyone else who had passed this way had seen it. The adventurers and Maviola saw a huge, rotting…pile. Of flesh. It was being burned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Is that a Flesh Giant?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pisces blinked. And then the line moved, and Maviola El, and the Horns of Hammerad saw the gates of Invrisil waiting for them. The City of Adventurers awaited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At long last. On an ordinary day—Ceria Springwalker raised her head. She saw the [Guards] at the gate calling out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Nightfall! Locking down the gates! Invrisil is under curfew! Come back tomorrow!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The portcullis slammed down. The travellers stared up at the gates. Ceria's mouth opened. She inhaled the smell of burning, rotting flesh. Looked around. Yvlon looked just as startled. Pisces blinked a few times as people at the gates shouted indignantly. Ksmvr nodded to himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe the [Guardsman] forgot to say 'welcome to Invrisil'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">491048</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:42:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 2)</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/489231</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Diamond Swords of Serept. One of the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; relics of this world. Six blades, each forged by Serept of Khelt. A [King] beyond mere &lt;em&gt;mortal&lt;/em&gt; [Kings]. He reigned for three thousand years before time consumed him. And no foe less than that ever humbled him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The swords shone in the ancient chest. Each one a different color; each one shaped of &lt;em&gt;diamond.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Most people didn't even know diamonds could take on color. More fools, they. But these blades had been forged of colored diamond. For instance—one was the shortest of swords, curved, a mix between a dagger and sword, really. And the diamond it had been made of was black.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet—transparent. Yet, lustrous. It shone in the light, the first time it had been seen in hundreds of years under the sun. Beautiful, deadly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They are among Khelt's great treasures. Each one is fit for a [General] or [King] of the old world. Perhaps none now live who are worthy of them. But a blade is meant to be used. And so—I offer my bargain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The speaker moved. His form was made of sand. Magic. An ancient curse. But it had replicated Fetohep of Khelt to perfection. He stood on the decks of the Emerald Signet, no longer the visage in the air. Speaking as he regarded his treasure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The chest is cursed. As are the artifacts. Death will befall any thief, as it did to those who stole the treasure from Khelt long ago. Yet, the blades endure. If Serept the Creator had any flaw, it was that his work was too perfect; the curse consumed the [Thieves] at sea so completely they never even uttered a word of distress. So my treasure was lost."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Revenant, the undead [King] turned his head. And he met a young [Lord]'s eyes. Wil Kallinad stood with Venaz, Feshi, Merrik, Yerranola, and Peki.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Staring. This was their adventure at sea. A tale of boredom, sea creatures, danger, friendship, failed romance, and hope, mixed with awe and fear throughout. But it had been their small adventure. Until this moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Now, they looked at a legend. And who more fitting to this story than Fetohep of Khelt? A ruler of an ancient nation. He looked at his blades, at Wil, and pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Boy. I say again: this is my bargain. It is no &lt;em&gt;joke&lt;/em&gt;, or prank."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes flashed as the apparition spoke. It was powerful magic that gave Fetohep a presence thousands of miles from where he actually was. He gestured at the swords, each a different color and style.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three of the six swords. Half of the treasure that belongs to &lt;em&gt;me.&lt;/em&gt; You will return the other three blades to my presence. And in exchange—I will grant you the use of the other three swords. For as long as you live. No longer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned his head, expecting a response. And Wil Kallinad was frozen. Because he had expected treasure, dreamed of it. But with it in front of him he couldn't help but feel like he was dreaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was Merrik who found his voice first. The Dwarf looked at Fetohep, gripping his beard in one fist. But his voice was steady. Forged of his own species' resilience. He had seen wonders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Er—you, sir. You're undead, ain't you? Who are you, then? Some old spirit? How can we return your swords to you? Chuck 'em back over the sides?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil choked. Fetohep's head slowly turned. But Merrik looked genuinely confused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Fetohep of Khelt. Dwarf. Ruler of Khelt, paradise of Chandrar. &lt;em&gt;Do you not know of me?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki started. She bowed slightly. Fetohep's gaze flickered to her. Venaz copied the gesture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Khelt? Dead gods."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He whispered, looking as stunned as Wil. Yerranola copied the gesture on the grounds that it was probably wise. But she and Feshi looked as confused as Merrik. The Dwarf bowed, eying his companions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I apologize, er, King Fetohep. I haven't heard of Khelt. But I've never been to Chandrar."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And Khelt's name has not reached Deríthal-vel? Do the Dwarves forget old friends so easily? Perhaps even legends fade. Perhaps young Atwood was correct…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] looked—disgruntled. Wil Kallinad spoke, trying, suddenly, to remember how to bow to the Chandrarian ruler. Just so—he made an attempt of it, putting his hand just below his heart, two fingers extended, sweeping his leg back like…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"King Fetohep. I am Wil Kallinad of Pheislant. I greet you and beg your majesty's forgiveness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The eyes flashed at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is given, young man. As is the ignorance of your companions. I did not think to find &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; lost treasures today. But you have found them. So, once again, for a third time, I offer my bargain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sounded overly patient. And he emphasized &lt;em&gt;'my'.&lt;/em&gt; Wil gulped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three swords, your Majesty?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. You may pick each one. And you will make haste to Chandrar to deliver the other relics to me. Yes. &lt;em&gt;You alone, &lt;/em&gt;Wil Kallinad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep twisted his fingers. The swords flashed in the light—a trick of the blades, or magic? The sand-figure turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The curse shall seize whomever touches my swords. However—Wil Kallinad, I grant you the right to touch my blades. And those three blades you first pick will be yours to share. Again, until your deaths."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What happens then?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep looked at Yerranola. The Selphid hurriedly bowed again. The [King] sounded impatient, and moderated his tone as if he was speaking to dullards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The blades shall return to me. Upon your death. In the light of the sun they cannot escape my gaze. So they will come to Khelt. Any attempt to hide them away will meet with the curse of Khelt. And it will consume the blood of any who attempt to withhold them, down to the last child of those who would steal from me. Do you…&lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; what I am offering you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] seemed to fear this was very much in doubt. The students traded looks. The [Sailors], Captain Lasc, and everyone else were just staring. Wil still wanted to know if this was a trick. But Merrik spoke up again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So, three of the six swords, your Majesty? And you can locate them after our deaths? Seems a rather fortuitous deal to suddenly make. What's to stop us from claiming six? There are…six of us. Perhaps we could take all six and return them to you before we die? Anyways, if three of us were to get the swords, what about me? I'm a &lt;em&gt;Dwarf&lt;/em&gt;. Time lasts for me longer than most folk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sounded like he was debating the Titan, the Professor in class. But Fetohep was not Niers Astoragon. He looked at Merrik. And then he laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With dark humor. With amusement at the effrontery. The sand making up his body expanded. The [King] rose, looking down at Merrik. The people on the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Your lifespan is still short compared to mine. And if you would try Khelt's wrath, pick up the sword, Dwarf. Do not take my offer as weakness; I make it because my generosity outweighs the gratitude you have done me for locating my treasure. I could take my swords back.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He flicked his wrist. A vortex of sand engulfed the Kheltian chest. A miniature maelstrom. And the stone chest and swords began to &lt;em&gt;lift&lt;/em&gt; off the ground. Higher, higher. Wil cried out with dismay. Feshi sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn it, Merrik."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The chest soared across the sea as Fetohep pointed. But it circled back. And the ruler spread his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But I still offer this bargain out of the mortality I remember. &lt;em&gt;Gratitude&lt;/em&gt;. For acts of daring, for luck, for these things should be rewarded. Now. Tell me, Dwarf."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He leaned down. Merrik stared up at the glowing eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you wish to &lt;em&gt;bargain&lt;/em&gt; with me? For I am no [Merchant]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik raised his hands. He grinned, backing up, as the chest lowered itself to the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, your Majesty. Please excuse my impertinence. I've a tongue on me. Too chatty by far. That's what the old grandfathers used to say."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is excused, Dwarf."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] shrank back down. He looked from face to face. Now, curiously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Terandrian [Lord]. A Dwarf. A Selphid, a son of the House of Minos, a Plains Gnoll. And a Garuda. Do you hail from Chandrar, girl?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Peki. The [Martial Artist] bowed, in a different style. A warrior's salute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I come from Pomle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. How did such a group come searching for my treasure?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep turned to Wil. The young [Lord] replied, trying to explain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're…students of the Titan of Baleros, Niers Astoragon, your Majesty. And we…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead [King]'s eyes flickered at the Titan's name. And he smiled—although his emaciated face was always smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see. Youthful adventure. Then, thank your luck, young Kallinad. You have the right of choosing of the Swords of Serept. If you choose, choose wisely; each one is different. If not…I shall return in one day's time. Give me your answer then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raised a hand before Wil could respond, and his form collapsed into sand. The sand blew off the side of the ship, and into the sea. And then—only the diamond swords remained. Wil stared, wide-eyed, around at the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It had been such a &lt;em&gt;quick&lt;/em&gt; encounter. And yet—his mind was spinning. Venaz exhaled slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He could have blasted our flesh from our bones. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; that? Some kind of astral projection spell. And yet, the &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. Wil, you didn't tell me the chest was &lt;em&gt;cursed.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gave Wil a vaguely reproachful look. Wil weakly spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I didn't think it was worth mentioning. Even the Professor's notes said it was unlikely to be the actual treasure…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at a [Storm Sailor] standing to the side. Inky's eyes were wide. As awed as the other's. She looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was just sitting there. In a pile of bones. Was that undead a…ruler of &lt;em&gt;Khelt?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Kingdom of Undead. Ruled by nigh-immortal monarchs. A beauteous place, or so it's said. For the few that enter. Never conquered; even the King of Destruction struck a deal rather than invade."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc murmured. He shook himself. And stared at Wil, purely shocked. The swords glittered in the chest. A black dagger, a green diamond greatsword. A rose blade, with only one edge. A yellow longsword…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magic. Treasure. Relics. &lt;em&gt;Relic-class&lt;/em&gt; artifacts. Wil felt light-headed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This isn't happening. Yerra? Pinch me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm trying. But it's not working on &lt;em&gt;me. &lt;/em&gt;But if I feel something, I know I'm dreaming. Dead gods. Dead gods—we found something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid was pinching her dead flesh. Feshi was sniffing the air, wide-eyed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We found them? Just—lying there? What will you do, Wil? Take the offer, surely? But would not someone steal them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fetohep might object. But maybe he only knows where the blades are. How strong's the curse? How…am I dreaming?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil murmured weakly. He looked around. His friends were gazing at him. The [Sailors] were murmuring. But it was a different kind of awe than seeing the Treant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Treasure.&lt;/em&gt; Wil felt it tugging at him. But he had to know. He reached for one arm, and hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peki? Hit me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda turned her head. She nodded. Merrik's head snapped around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, wait. Peki, don't actually—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil saw the Garuda raise a fist—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil Kallinad woke up in his bunk with a jaw that &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; broken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't. But he groaned and would have shouted with the pain except that just made the jaw feel worse. He felt for a healing potion, drank it, and got up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone—something was going &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt; abovedecks. Wil stumbled up the stairs. It was dark. But the entire crew of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was on the decks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drinking. They &lt;em&gt;cheered&lt;/em&gt; as they saw Wil, lifting mugs. Countless barrels had been breached, and food and liquor was being consumed liberally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ship was celebrating. Including Wil's friends. He saw Peki duck her head and hide behind a wing as he stumbled towards them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil! Never ask Peki to punch you! But she's sorry, right, Peki?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda looked shamefaced. Wil stared around. Everyone was partying. The chest was closed and guarded by a group of [Storm Sailors], but even they were drinking. And Captain Lasc was toasting Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;A treasure of Khelt! Now there's a story worthy of the seas!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Wil, raising his mug. Wil looked around. Feshi was passing around a refill to his friends. Then a huge arm grabbed him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil. You've done it. That is to say—the Professor &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; right. A treasure. And relics. I'm envious. However—it's yours by right. And this all started of Daquin. Come, you have to toast with me! The world won't forget your name in a hurry! No—this is the beginning of your legend."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was slightly wet-eyed as he raised a mug. He towed Wil towards the center of the ship and everyone shouted as Venaz slammed a hand on Wil's shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Treasure!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur roared. Wil could&lt;em&gt; smell&lt;/em&gt; how drunk he was. Dumbfounded, the [Lord] looked around. But he'd missed hours of this. Apparently—once the shock had worn off, a massive party had begun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And everyone had convinced themselves this was &lt;em&gt;real.&lt;/em&gt; Feshi had even plucked some fur off her arm—electing not to be hit by Peki. The Gnoll, Yerra, everyone was looking at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So, gradually, he realized it was real. Wil had to have a drink. And there was plenty about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three blades. To give to anyone of your choosing. Imagine if the Professor were to get one? You could trade them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fetohep might not approve of passing them about. Sounded like Wil had to choose."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik was wagging a finger. But Inky, Delivan, the other [Sailors] were staring at Wil out of the corner of their eyes. Venaz was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, yes. Perhaps it's not that simple. But if Wil says 'yes'—and what benefit is there to saying no?—he suddenly has a mission."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Chandrar. It's far from Izril. But—well, the blades are important. If you could drop me at a port before we go there, I could go to Izril."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi was nodding. The others were looking at Wil. And he—well, he was about four drinks in by this time and his head was spinning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I just can't believe—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Enough of that! It's real! As real as anything! What are you going to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra was happily soused. She leaned on Wil, hugging him with excitement for her friend. And Wil Kallinad thought as he downed his drink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The next day, Fetohep of Khelt appeared in a whirling spectacle of sand on the decks of the ship. He paused, and looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Face-down [Sailors]. A few comatose forms. Had the ship already been attacked for his treasures?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No—they were just drunk. Or hung over and wishing they were dead. Fetohep saw a group of people start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—oh—dead gods, he's here. Is it day &lt;em&gt;already?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Selphid stared up at the bright, blue skies. She wobbled out of her seat and rolled over on the moving deck. The undead [King] stared at her as she waved at something past his shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. Heeey. It's me. Yerranola. Wil—he's got a decision."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Lord] unsteadily rose to his feet. He was still drunk. But he had made his decision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"King Fetohep of Khelt—I accept your terms. But—may I beg some of your time? We have one last place to visit. A &lt;em&gt;shipwreck.&lt;/em&gt; With treasure. Not as glorious as yours—or more glorious, actually. May we visit it first?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was doing his best to be polite. The ruler of Khelt, the immortal undead, Fetohep, eyed Wil's unfocused gaze. He spoke, curtly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"By all means. What is time to one such as I? But I have your word?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Three swords, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…That is what I said."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil Kallinad nodded a few times. He looked for Captain Lasc, who'd passed out in his cabin. Vaguely, Wil waved his hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We sail to &lt;em&gt;Chandrar! &lt;/em&gt;After the last shipwreck."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He clarified and the awake drunks cheered. Some people on deck woke up and spat curses. Fetohep saw a figure standing next to the steering wheel jerk up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;To Chandrar!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik swung the ship's wheel around. Wil's face went slack as his friends turned. The boom swung across the deck. Wil ducked. So did Feshi. Peki, Venaz, and Yerra didn't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep of Khelt saw the three go overboard. There was a &lt;em&gt;splash&lt;/em&gt;, confusion—the [King] sighed. He looked at Wil and turned away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Mortals.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Alluring Prize; a Sailor's Nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drunken excitement. Incredulity. The first day, &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was chaos. But as the second day dawned, aching heads led to purpose. The ship set sail; for there was one last shipwreck to investigate. And Fetohep, overly patient and perhaps, regretting his generosity, had allowed it before their transit to Chandrar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the ship was in search of a final treasure. And—if you thought the excitement was at a fever's pitch, it was even higher. Because Wil and his friends had a thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final shipwreck might contain something even greater.&lt;/em&gt; What that might be, only Wil knew. And he refused to share. But his anticipation was a physical thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Dragonship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So the Storm Ship, eagerly led by Captain Lasc, sailed off in search of that ninth and final shipwreck. They had a ways to go. The first day of the final leg of their journey was libations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The second was hangover, planning. And on the third? There was a battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Under the sea, two Drowned Ships clashed. Captain Therrium of &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; led his crew through the waters. The Drowned Folk swam &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the magical field protecting their ship. Into another pocket of air. They hit the decks, showering water, and locked blades with the enemy crew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In near-silence. The two ships fought in the dark waters. Therrium, half-Eel, swung his sword with vicious grace. Each time he locked blades with another enemy [Depth Sailor], an electrical current &lt;em&gt;shocked&lt;/em&gt; his opponent, running though his enchanted blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His [First Mate] was just as deadly. Half-starfish, she cut and hacked with two blades, a hatchet and shortsword, eschewing safety. Her wounds began to heal and she was fearless. Even when the enemy [Captain] hacked half the fingers off her right hand, she just slashed with her other axe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The fighting was short, fierce, and bitter. But not &lt;em&gt;bloody&lt;/em&gt;—at least, not as much as it could have been. The other [Depth Captain] surrendered, presenting her blade to Therrium. The Drowned Man grimaced, counting the wounded; the other ship had surrendered rather than be slaughtered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You sail under &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; command now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He snapped at the [Depth Captain] who'd lost. She compressed her lips, but signed the document.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"For six months, aye. And the treasure?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We wait! A final shipwreck awaits and I will have the entirety of it or naught at all. The landfolk's luck is running strong. We wait."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That had been what the quarrel was about. The other ship had wanted to attack now and claim the Swords of Serept. Therrium had disagreed. Now, he had two ships under his command. But—he was restless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They have a Kheltian treasure, Captain. Better to cut our losses and seize them now, rather than later?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] examined her slowly-regrowing fingers as the others tended to their wounds. The defeated crew were doing the same, heads hung low. The Undersea Crews often came to blows. But they didn't kill each other; they preferred submission to slaughter of their own kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Patience has gotten us further than not. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; say we wait. After all—that [Lord] is as keen on the final shipwreck as he is on those relics. What's worth delaying claiming the blades?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crew looked up sharply as Therrium stared around. The [First Mate]'s eyes lit up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"An even greater treasure, Captain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Exactly. Now, get the ships moving. Get our [Mages]—I'll blow winds in the sails of the landfolk if I have to!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium gritted his teeth. He was taking a risk. More treasure. Something…his instincts were screaming there was a double fortune to be had. But he was worried. He cursed as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; moved too slowly for him, for all it was covering the ocean at a quick pace. But it would have been too slow even if it moved as fast as the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; for Therrium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because word was spreading. The students had found the Diamond Swords of Serept. And now—&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; was aware of that fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil Kallinad was not an idiot. Or he tried not to be. Nor was Captain Lasc. After that day of libations, Wil had suddenly realized the swords made him the biggest target on the sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc was already on top of that. He'd posted his most trusted [Sailors] around the chest. &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; Inky, in fact, but [Storm Sailors] who'd served with him for over ten years in some cases. And he had blunt words for Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you think there's something worth searching for, I'll deliver you to this final shipwreck, Lord Kallinad. But until then—I'll be plotting a course away from every major sailing route, sir. And I'll treat every vessel we come across as potentially hostile. Any [Pirate] gets wind of this bounty and we'll be fighting for our lives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The chest was under lock and key—well, metaphorically. It was sitting in the center of the ship; the crew had moved it there, but they'd feared to stow it below. Fetohep of Khelt had warned dire consequences for anyone but Wil who touched the blades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So, now the ship sailed. Wil had helped Lasc plot the most evasive route he could devise towards his final destination. But no one, not even the [Storm Captain] knew where the final shipwreck was. Wil was on tenterhooks—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For the first four days. But he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; at sea. And even with the [Storm Captain] and an excellent ship, the sea was vast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; moves faster than most ships her size, especially without as much cargo, sirs. We're running high on the waters, actually. But we'll still be six more days at sea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan announced. The [Strategists] nodded. They were taking turns guarding the chest with the [Storm Sailors]. And—debating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So, what &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; you do with the swords, Wil? The three of them you can pick, I mean?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hope I can ask Fetohep what each of them do. They must have different enchantments. And—I might bequeath all of them away."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil grimaced at the thought. But he had been debating for the last four days with his friends the most optimal way to use the bounty. Merrik looked shocked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You won't keep even one? You can't imagine how powerful a single blade might make you! &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;can't imagine it! Are you mad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We've been over this, Merrik. Wil is a decent fighter, but those swords are best used in the hands of experts. I myself would give them away if I owned them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz didn't look happy to admit that, but he had agreed with Wil. The [Lord] was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…I might give all three away. One &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to go to the King of Pheislant. The monarchy would be offended if I didn't. And it will boost House Kallinad's reputation through the ceiling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. Politics over relics?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik spluttered. Wil raised an admonitory finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It might deter Ailendamus. It's &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;, Merrik. The second blade? I might…give it to Lady Foliana."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Three-Color Stalker?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi was combing her hair. She glanced up. Wil nodded as the others inhaled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"In exchange for the Professor giving me suitable artifacts or money in return."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Smart. As if people weren't afraid of Lady Foliana enough already."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola was lounging on a bed; Peki was the only one absent, being chosen to sit with the chest. They rotated every half-hour—every few hours at night. The [Storm Sailors] were keeping watch too, but Wil didn't dare take his eyes off the chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If I get anything, I'll share it with all of you. Fair's fair."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw, that's noble of you, lad. And of course, we'll accept."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik laughed and the others chortled. No false modesty here. The students didn't look a gift-horse in the mouth; they immediately sold it off and counted their gold. Venaz glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It will be worth it, just to say we participated in this trip. Let alone if we find whatever has you so excited for the ninth shipwreck. And to visit Khelt. I hear it is a paradise. But where might the third blade go, Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lord Kallinad looked embarrassed. He scratched at his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—I might just make it a gift to the Order itself. But, um, I think it'd go best to my sister. Talia. She's a Knight of the Summer. And the Order of Seasons would owe me a debt. If she refuses—perhaps to one of the Knight-Commanders. I doubt they'd refuse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Smart."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others agreed. But Merrik looked wistful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If I didn't think that Fetohep fellow was being serious, I'd risk swinging the blades about. Not to &lt;em&gt;steal&lt;/em&gt;, but—I wonder if he'll let us hold them? Just once?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can always ask. He seemed rather reasonable. And generous."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola smiled. The others looked at her, nodding. Feshi sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt; I could go with you. But I can't travel all the way to Khelt and back and expect to make it to the Meeting of Tribes. I'll sail to Izril as soon as we make port."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're…passing by the House of Minos. Assuming this isn't part of a trick, we could charter a ship from there, Feshi."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz glanced at Wil. The [Lord] locked his lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't say anything. But we'll get you to the Meeting of Tribes, Feshi. Anyways, that's my plan. I know it's not dramatic—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it's &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;. No need to die over the blades. I get it. I just wish I could own them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik leaned back. He reached for a wine flask. Then frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Empty. Venaz, pour me something out of that keg."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur reached over and pressed on a tap. Nothing happened. The other students sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who's going to get more drinks? Not me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola instantly raised her hand. The others did likewise. Wil was slowest. With good humor, he rose. He walked up the deck, on top of the world. True, nothing was happening now and they had more time at sea—but he had done it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Strange—he didn't feel like he'd earned the blades. And he hadn't. But then—he wasn't going to own any of them. Privately, in his heart of hearts, Wil was hurt by that too. He would have loved to own…well, he didn't even know what the swords did. And that was for the best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Delivan, do we have anything to drink? We're out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil hailed the [First Mate] on the deck. The man looked up. So did Inky and a small gathering of [Sailors]. The [First Mate] grimaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You too? This might be worse than I thought. Lord Kallinad—we might have a situation on our hands that needs resolving soonest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan glanced around. So did Wil, reading the expressions on the other sailors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're out of drink. We must have used it up all during the party."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky crossed her arms. She looked bad-tempered. The other [Sailors] murmured. Wil hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, we're about a week from our destination. We'll have to make do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, we bleeding well &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Begal snapped. The [Lord] looked at him. Delivan gestured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad. Might I explain a few customs of the sea? Including the Sailor's Ration? Captain Lasc! We've a situation on our hands."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked grave. And Wil slowly realized they'd reached the [Sailor]'s worst nightmare. Worse than krakens, or monsters, or being becalmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. Rum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Merchant's Garden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Sailor's Ration was a nautical term. It referred to, well, the standard food a [Sailor] got per day. If they were running out, it might not be much food, or good food. Of course—any good ship had bags of holding, and barrels besides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Horrible hardtack, water, bread—all that could be eaten. But what couldn't run out, the truest part of the Sailor's Ration that they really meant when they referred to it was—rum. Alcohol. Liquor of any kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It &lt;em&gt;could not&lt;/em&gt; be allowed to run out. Or dire things happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Y'see, Lord Kallinad, a man or woman on the seas can live eating hardtack, even with their bleedin' gums. They can fight monsters and sail through storms. But not go thirsty. Each [Sailor] gets their tot per day. And they &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; it. It's the only thing that keeps them going. It runs out and, well, it's bad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan explained as Captain Lasc cursed over the absence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We shouldn't have breached so many kegs. But I didn't think to count for the celebration. There's no hope for it. We'll have to find someone to trade with. Worst case? We make for the House of Minos."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Over &lt;em&gt;alcohol?&lt;/em&gt; Captain Lasc, you agreed that being covert was key!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil was aghast. The [Storm Captain] shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad, lack of the Sailor's Ration is the surest path to mutiny. I won't risk it. The crew? They drink the stuff with &lt;em&gt;each &lt;/em&gt;meal. You want to imagine what happens when it runs out? Fights will start occurring within the day."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] covered his face. He could just imagine; he had classmates who were just as alcoholic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Please tell me we don't have to visit a port."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He wasn't about to have every [Thief] coming after the treasure. Although…did Minotaur [Thieves] exist? That might almost be worth seeing. But the [Captain] was shaking his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can cast about for local ships. I've a Skill—[Ship's Beacon]. Most [Captains] have some method, even if it's a [Message] scroll. By your leave, Lord Kallinad. We'll know if any ship is willing to trade us within the day. If there are any in these waters, they will; they know a Sailor's Ration. Won't take more than a bit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And sure enough—the [Captain] fired what looked like a glowing, green flare of light from the prow of his ship. And Wil saw an answering flare within five minutes, far distant. The [Captain] turned his ship. And that was that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're meeting a &lt;em&gt;foreign ship&lt;/em&gt; in the waters with a relic-class treasure just to get rum?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi looked horrified as the crew loitered on the decks. Most of them—including Merrik and Yerranola—gave her incredulous looks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. We can't do without rum!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Or whiskey.&lt;/em&gt; I'd sooner cut off my leg. At least that grows back. We ran out last night. You lot were lucky you had some left! I'd have come calling if I knew you still had some!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky hung over the railing, looking miserable. Like any true alcoholic—she was already looking &lt;em&gt;antsy.&lt;/em&gt; Wil glanced at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it can't be &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;bad, Inky. If you had to go without drink for a week—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd kill you and eat your liver, Lord Kallinad. You think your lot drinks? That's cute."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailor] didn't bat an eyelid. Venaz folded his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've seen you [Sailors] drink, Inky. I'd say the Titan's students can keep up with you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The part-Octopus woman laughed. So did the other [Sailors]. Inky shook her head at the Minotaur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sea Cow, you think that's all there is to it? We might not be able to outdrink &lt;em&gt;Minotaurs&lt;/em&gt;, but—we have a stiff glass of whiskey for &lt;em&gt;breakfast.&lt;/em&gt; We're &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; drunk. You've never talked to me when I'm not partly sloshed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even Yerranola looked impressed. Inky stared into the sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hard enough keeping sky watch, sea watch, and &lt;em&gt;undersea&lt;/em&gt; watch while you're sober."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So all that stuff you told me about enjoying the sea…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil raised one eyebrow. Inky glanced at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Obviously I was tellin' the truth, Lord Kallinad. But the drink makes it better. Think you'd get [Sailors] willing to stare at the sea for hours &lt;em&gt;sober?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that was that. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet &lt;/em&gt;cut through the waters. And soon enough, Wil saw a distant ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ship sighted! &lt;/em&gt;I'm readin' &lt;em&gt;The Gold of Paxil,&lt;/em&gt; Captain!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's a Balerosian ship. [Merchant] name. Seems true enough. Take us closer. And raise the flags!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc ordered. Wil saw the other ship doing the same. It was indeed a merchant's ship. A galleon, same as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nevertheless, the crew was leery of the other ship. They'd thrown a tarp over the treasure chest, and they stood at the railing, calling out to the other ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was crewed, Wil saw, by Lizardfolk. And the [Captain] was a Naga.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hail to you, Storm Captain! What seems to be the problem? Or are you here for trade?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A bestrewn Naga, covered in wealth from bangles to rich clothing as they so liked to do was at the helm. He was a [Merchant Captain] and smiled as the Lizardfolk called greetings. Captain Lasc shouted back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trade is our goal, sir! Do you have spare drink? We've spent our Sailor's Ration and my crew is in dire straits!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why of course! For a small fee, we can share our drink! Come aboard! I'll swear on truth spell that we mean only to trade in peace! And we've other goods—we're bound for Wistram! More than enough alcohol to go around!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's a relief. Those [Mages] won't miss a few dozen kegs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik murmured to Peki. The Garuda snorted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They drink a lot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil wasn't sure that his fellow students and he were the ones to be throwing stones. But the two ships were docking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a procedure for making sure the opposition wasn't planning something devious or underhanded. Lasc shouted across the deck while the other side cast a [Detect Lies] spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not a [Pirate] or planning to attack you in any way!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Me neither!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Naga [Captain] shouted back. The formalities completed, the two strode over the gangplanks and shook hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And what takes your ship around Minos' waters? Trade? We run this route; it's preferable to save time by going through Minotaur waters. And yourself?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Escorting a few of my passengers to Terandria. We ran into some trouble along the way. [Necromancers]. But all's settled; we just happened to use up most of our rum celebrating. We'd have stopped at Minos, but you were closer. You have our thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc lied fairly smoothly, blending truth with omission. The [Merchant Captain] chortled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So I see. May I know your name, sir?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Charles de Trevalier."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil lied smoothly. It was standard practice for the Kallinad family to pretend to be one of their enemies if they had to pretend to their nobility. Wil had chosen a particularly annoying member of the Trevalier family he'd known as a boy. The [Merchant] beamed, shaking his hand and going down the line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Charmed, charmed! Welcome, Lord Trevalier. And if I can interest you in my wares? I'll have the drinks delivered at once. Let's talk about the price…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lizardfolk [Sailors] were already merrily rolling up barrels of relief for the crew of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; to cheers from Lasc's crew. The [Captain] began haggling with the Naga as Wil and his fellow students stepped aboard the other ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As a formality. Wil hissed at Peki (whom he did not exactly trust to keep her mouth shut), and Yerra (whom he didn't trust for the exact same reason) to stay with the covered chest. They did so, much to Wil's relief. And Captain Xenic, for that was his name, seemed to be exactly what he seemed to be: a [Merchant] who plied his goods across sea routes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had an interesting ship. Wil spotted a wide, &lt;em&gt;glass&lt;/em&gt; deck in the middle of the ship. Perplexed, he found himself staring down into a veritable greenhouse of growing plants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's this? I didn't know you could grow plants at sea!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And why not, Lord Charles? We have a fishery as well. We add to it with what we catch of course, but as you can see—I have [Expanded Cargo Hold] as a Skill."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The garden and interior storage was indeed larger than the dimensions of the ship should allow. Fascinated, the students stared through the opening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a neat little system. Sun would shine down through the glass ceiling, giving the plants light. For air—the crew could pull back parts of the deck. And water?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Hydromancers]. And water is easy to desalinate! Well, the garden is a huge savings. Each ship has their little secrets. Storm Captains and their ship spells, Drowned ships which can dive…we have mostly food products bound for Wistram. The [Mages] import all sorts. Lots of sugar and some rather smelly beans for some reason. Cacao, I think. But can I interest you in any of it? Prices may be steep…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not in the market for much, Captain Xenic. But I'll gladly purchase some…sugar? My Garuda friend loves it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Out of politeness, Wil spent some gold on a few bags of sugar. Costly, but Peki &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; love it. As did Yerra. And Feshi. And probably Inky if her gold teeth were any indication. Or maybe that was bad dental hygiene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xenic insisted on taking Wil below and showing him more of the garden and fish tank, which was impressive. The Lizardfolk crew could help themselves to snacks from the breeding and growing fish; they were mostly Lizardfolk. Only a few Nagas on board, including Xenic himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That should be enough for two weeks without another party; more than enough time to get you to port without a disaster. Can I interest you in anything else?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, Captain Xenic. And I thank you for your hospitality."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all! Not at all! It's a fascinating company you have, Lord Trevalier."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Naga twinkled at Wil. To the [Lord]'s relief, Venaz had kept his mouth shut and Merrik and Feshi had stoutly done the same. Now, the Naga looked at the different species and Wil tensed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"May I ask where such a group gathered?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil hesitated, then did his best impression of a Trevalier. He turned his head and narrowed his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Minotaur is a bodyguard. As for my companions—I believe that is my business, wouldn't you agree?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Naga instantly bowed slightly, looking abashed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As you say, Lord Trevalier. My apologies. I am a curious sort."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I shall accept your apology."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil copied Fetohep's mannerisms there. The [Captain] apologized again, and rather to Wil's relief—that was the end of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one asked about the covered treasure chest; the [Sailors] were doing their best to block the view of the other crew anyways. The Naga didn't press too hard about Wil's companions; why would he? It was polite conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The barrels were loaded onto &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet &lt;/em&gt;and paid for. All without a hitch. Because, and this was important: &lt;em&gt;that was normally how it worked. &lt;/em&gt;Coincidental hijinks and unfortunate events did not occur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even so, Wil heaved a sigh of relief as the other ship sailed off. But it was done. He turned to Captain Lasc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; may we continue our voyage?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lord Kallinad. And we have the drinks to do it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] snatched a cup out of Yerra's hand as she bent towards the first barrel, already being breached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"With restraint to our passengers, of course. No more drinking games."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid sighed. But that was it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Gold of Paxil &lt;/em&gt;returned to its trip, Captain Xenic glanced over his shoulder. He had not asked about the odd passengers. Or the tarp over the chest. Or anything else, really.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because he hadn't needed to. The Naga already knew…all of it. And he carefully slithered into his cabin and checked the map.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aha. I have the coordinates. Someone, get a [Message] spell to Wistram, and…Lord Seagrass. I'm sure he'll be happy to pay for the information."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Xenic chuckled to himself as his ship sailed at speed towards Wistram. He also had an [Aeromancer] on board and he could have outrun or caught &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; if he chose. But he was a [Merchant]; he didn't rob ships, even if he thought he could have taken the treasure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he'd earn a large enough bounty for relaying the location of Wil Kallinad to these sources. Xenic was laboring over his [Message] scroll, neatly writing down a few observation and the coordinates when he glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain! Ships sighted on the horizon!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, what now? Do they need more water? Food? Wait—did you say, &lt;em&gt;ships?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Merchant Captain] slithered out of his cabin. He stopped on the deck as the Lizardpeople [Sailors] pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the distance were a trio of ships, headed straight for &lt;em&gt;The Gold of Paxil. &lt;/em&gt;Each one was flying a black flag, with a skull. And that skull was bleeding from one eye socket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Bloodtear Pirates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xenic's smile vanished. He whirled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Take us about! Now! We sail for the House of Minos! Send a [Message]! Now!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Lizardfolk scrambled to obey. Xenic shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Fire every single scroll-spell we have! Dump the cargo! All of it!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ship turned, shedding inventory as fast as it could. But the Bloodtear Pirates were sailing straight at them. They did not respond to Xenic's hails. They did not slow. And this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was just a diversion. A snack before the main course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Thirty minutes later, Captain Xenic slithered into his cabin. He stared down at the blood on his scales. He listened, as his crew surrendered outside the cabin. They had been…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slaughtered. The survivors might live, if the Bloodtear Pirates didn't seize the ship. And if they did—they'd still live. As [Slaves].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But not the [Captain]. Someone &lt;em&gt;crashed&lt;/em&gt; into the door that Xenic had locked. The Naga looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I should have known they'd be followed. A costly mistake, that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He lay against his map table. Watching blood run onto the precious paper. An odd sight. The Naga slipped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was looking for something. His head was fuzzy. But he had a purpose. The [Merchant] had been cheated. Not by Wil. He'd made a business decision—been unprepared for the stakes. He bore Wil no ill-will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Funny."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Naga chuckled, and then refocused. He was rather bitter about being a small player in this…story. A casualty at the wrong place and the wrong time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But even he could have one last bite. The door shook as someone &lt;em&gt;cracked&lt;/em&gt; the reinforced wood. But Xenic had found it. He idly studied the [Message] scroll. With a flourish, he wrote a few last lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…have been ambushed by the Bloodtear Pirates. In pursuit of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Captain Seagrass, hurry, if you intend to reach the ship on time. Yours…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Xenic signed his name. Then he activated the scroll. It flashed and &lt;em&gt;vanished&lt;/em&gt; as the Naga sat back. He was smiling, content, as the first [Pirate] strolled through the door. The Naga rose—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A sword cut through his midsection. The [Captain] of the Bloodtear Pirates turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Loot the ship quickly. We're returning to the hunt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all. A small detail on the waves. But it had mattered. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet &lt;/em&gt;sailed on, blissfully ignorant of what had happened. More days passed, without crisis or incident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were three days from their destination when it happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shocking Revelations and Sand Gets Everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can tell you now we're three days from our destination, Captain Lasc. But we'll be taking a different route than what we have planned. And I'd like to discuss what will happen when we arrive at the shipwreck. It may be…the [Divers] will recover more than they can immediately haul."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil Kallinad was speaking to Captain Lasc as the man plotted their course across the sea. They were relatively far from any useful landmarks. In the…well, sea. Featureless, at least from the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they were still within range of the House of Minos. Wil pointed to it as Captain Lasc turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your final destination is yours to keep, Lord Kallinad. I'll sail wherever you point me. If you want to steer us in circles for a few days, you have my command."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man really did seem to be decent and honest. Wil nodded at him, grateful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, Captain. Once we reach the shipwreck I think we'll know as soon as it's found. Assuming it's there. If it is…significant, we may end up calling in the House of Minos for support. Venaz assured me their navy would respond to his call."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc's eyebrows rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's a force of the sea right there, Lord Kallinad. Begging your pardon—no, I won't ask what we'll find. But what manner of danger might there be?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…I don't know, Captain. But if it is anything like the crab, I'll defer to your judgment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lord Kallinad. I wouldn't have it any other way. Then—tell me where we'll go today."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil was giving the [Captain] a slightly circuitous route towards their final destination that would get them there in 3 days—if he corrected their course the next day. That done, he left the cabin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How much longer, Wil? I'm &lt;em&gt;booooored.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola announced as she stared at the treasure chest. The students were now playing cards and relaxing next to the chest. Inky was teaching them a sailor's version of the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three days, Yerra. Be patient. We're nearly there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine. But I've gotten bored again. And the drinking is—okay, it's helping a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt;. But now I'm bored again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid flopped onto the deck, spread-eagled. Wil sat next to her as Feshi glanced suspiciously at Merrik's hands. He was gambling well; Venaz, and Feshi had tells. Peki and Inky on the other hand were doing well. Merrik's beard concealed most of his expressions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were done with discussing who might use the Swords of Serept best; Wil had considered everyone from The Blighted King to an Archmage of Wistram for maximum benefit. He'd stuck with Talia getting a blade if she wanted one, and possibly Foliana, but Venaz had assured him that there were better people to give the third blade to than Pheislant's monarchies. Wil would see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was in the future. Right now? Boredom, or rather, anticipation had resumed. And anticipation was worse, in a way. Yerranola stared up at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil patted her on the head. The Selphid bit at his fingers. She was going stir-crazy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Unless you want to make that more serious, do something &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;, Wil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Like what? Play chess?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Don't wanna."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Play cards, then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't wanna."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil exhaled. Yerranola was being willfully childish. He envied her, in a way. He cast around, had another lazy idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How about we put on the scrying orb?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—fine. We haven't done it in…a while. Actually."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola sat up. The other students glanced at her. They hadn't used the scrying orb; Umina and Marian had kept them abreast of the Professor's newest lessons. Wil set it up as Yerranola complained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm just &lt;em&gt;sick&lt;/em&gt; of that Drake. Noass? He's so—&lt;em&gt;dismissive&lt;/em&gt; of non-Drake events. You know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;We know.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi growled as she put down her hand and folded her arms. Yerranola watched as Wil prodded the scrying orb. A figure flickered into focus. Well—two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Noass was there. He was the regular anchor now—Sir Relz was more of a commentator while Noass delivered &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the news. And the broadcast now had a system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;If you're just tuning in, you're watching &lt;/em&gt;live&lt;em&gt;, Wistram Worldwide! The WWW's broadcast has all of the most &lt;/em&gt;important&lt;em&gt; events in—the entire world! And of course, our first topic tonight: the sea. Obviously, essential. And we've been keeping an eye on this story the entire time.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake's voice made Wil stir a bit. In the left side of the screen, he had a picture &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a picture, a separate viewpoint. Of a ship. On the ocean. The other students looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did he say the sea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mhm. We might find something interesting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky snorted as she shuffled the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"From a landsman? I doubt it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Joining us today is a special guest with a—seafarer's perspective. Of the sea. I'm joined in the studio by Gold-rank adventurer, Seborn Sailwinds. Adventurer Sailwinds, I understand you grew up on the sea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;That's correct. I'm a Drowned Man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Crab [Rogue] sat at the desk, staring unblinkingly at Noass. The Drake was sweating a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Er—you're new to Pallass, but I understand you have a historical career with the Halfseekers. But before that you were a [Sailor], correct?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;I wasn't a sailor. I was a [Pirate]. A member of the Undersea Crews. And I'm here to advertise my team. Hire the Halfseekers. There. I said it, Jelaqua.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn sat back in his chair. He stared into the 'camera' as he spoke. He didn't seem as…eager to be here as most of the guests Noass brought on. The [Commentator] coughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Er—we try not to advertise directly, Mister Sailwinds. So—so you were at sea? I understand it's a lifestyle, to uh, sail. Different perspectives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;Adventurer Seborn. &lt;/em&gt;And I'm a Drowned Man. Of course I lived at sea. I thought you were asking me intelligent questions.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Noass colored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well then, can you give us a rundown on the different sort of…enemies that might be inhibiting our people of interest?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured at the ship in the orb. Wil leaned forwards. It looked…familiar. But Seborn was speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;It'll mostly be [Pirates]. Or the Undersea crews. They're on a Storm Ship—I doubt many [Storm Sailors] will attack their own, but it might happen for treasure of this magnitude.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Storm Sailors? Ah—you mean—no, but &lt;em&gt;[Pirates] &lt;/em&gt;attack ships. [Storm Sailors] are, er, just [Sailors], correct?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Noass was metaphorically at sea, up to his earholes, and floundering. Seborn took a long drink of the complimentary water with a lemon he'd been provided and spoke irritably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;[Storm Sailors] aren't always honest; they can turn to piracy, but they don't have the class. And some Drowned Folk or those with some aspect of the sea can still be [Storm Sailors]. In the same way, [Pirates] can be Drowned Crews or airbreathers. And &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Drowned Folk join the Undersea Crews; they become [Depth Sailors], not [Storm Sailors]. And the Undersea Crews are only loyal to Drowned Folk. Understand?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Noass hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It all sounds…er, very complex."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;It's not.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drake was mopping at his brow with a handkerchief. That task was taken over by a Gnoll [Assistant], standing mostly off-screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—well, let's cut to this attack. I understand &lt;em&gt;The Gold of Paxil&lt;/em&gt; was sunk by a group of [Pirates] on an intercept course with this ship in all likelihood. By—the Bloodtear Pirates. What can you tell us about this group, Adventurer Seborn?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All the students looked up. Yerranola sat up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did he just say…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seborn was nodding as an image of the Bloodtear Pirates' flag appeared on screen, disappearing the one of the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Bloodtear Pirates. Marauders. They keep their word, but they give no quarter.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;They have a number of ships in their armada, spread out. Three is just an attack force. Still, more than enough to destroy a single Storm Ship.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I see. However, our, ah ship in question &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; carrying a full complement of [Storm Sailors] as well as regular ones and captained by an experienced [Storm Captain]. As well as six [Strategists]. Could that even the odds?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Three-to-one against Bloodtear Pirates? Not likely. How long do I have to be here?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw, come on, Seborn! At least smile for the audience! Hey, I'm his Captain. Can I go on—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another voice from the side. Noass snapped as Jelaqua, wearing a Drake's body, was pulled off-screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! Er—apologies for the interruption, everyone. So—&lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet's &lt;/em&gt;only chance is to outrun the opposition, is that right, Adventurer Seborn? But I doubt any group would lose the opportunity to seize &lt;em&gt;The Diamond Swords of Serept. &lt;/em&gt;Can you rate that as a treasure on a scale of one to ten?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Eleven?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—And I think we have Archmage Nailihuaile waiting, who can give us a rundown of some of the effects of the blades! If you're just tuning in, you're watching Wistram Worldwide &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;! With me is Adventurer Seborn of the Halfseekers, and we're…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The image flicked back to the ship as Noass kept talking. Wil stared. He stared at the ship. Which was…very familiar. He just hadn't recognized it because he hadn't seen an aerial view of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a good view. It had, well a deck full of [Sailors], a nice view of the ship. A [Captain] at the helm. A treasure chest in the center…and sitting next to it…a group of students sitting at a table. Two were sitting on the ground and one was staring into a scrying orb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil stared up at the sky. Then down at the orb. After about a minute, the image of the young man on the deck glanced up straight at the viewers for a second, and then looked back down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Wil. Why are we on the scrying orb?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola spoke very, very slowly. Wil's ears were just ringing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Diamond Swords of Serept.&lt;/em&gt; And that—that Drake was saying it over and over again. Announcing to the entire damn world that—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're being scried? We're on &lt;em&gt;the orb?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz stood up, incredulous. Feshi stood up, hair on end. She stared up, as if she could see the spell monitoring them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But how? &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt; But they shouldn't know we have the Swords of Serept. Not unless—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain Lasc! We have an emergency!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil was on his feet, shouting. The [Captain] looked up, and vaulted over the command deck. He ran towards Wil, looking alarmed. So did the other [Sailors]. Delivan—Venaz swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil! We have a spy! We have—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned his head. Merrik and Peki put down their cards. They stared at Inky. The [Storm Sailor] stared back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, no. Inky?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It wasn't me!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz slowly reached for a sword. Merrik was swearing, pulling his armor out of his bag of holding. Captain Lasc looked at Wil, bewildered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's going on? Lord Kallinad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For answer, Wil pointed into the scrying orb. The crew stared into it. And—on the orb—Captain Lasc was captured vaulting over the deck. The view cut back to Noass, who spoke urgently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um. It looks like something's going on. Hold on, viewers. We are of course monitoring the ship via [Distant Vision], not scrying; the ship is warded. Let me see if we can get ahold of our contact on board the ship. Mister Begal? Hello?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Suddenly, the voice was duplicated. One of the [Sailors] swore, recoiled, and clapped a hand to his side. A voice was speaking from the man's pocket. Wil's head slowly turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Begal?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn idiot [Mages]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc whirled as the [Sailor] grinned and backed up desperately. Lasc turned to Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's going on?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They know. &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; knows we have the swords! They're broadcasting it from Wistram! They have our position—&lt;em&gt;and we have [Pirates] on our tail!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil leapt to his feet. The [Storm Captain] drew his sword with an oath. Noass peered at the stone in his claw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh wait, I'm being told we might have to wait until later. We'll check back in later—uh oh. What's happening on deck?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone slapped the scrying orb. It went dark. Captain Lasc advanced and Begal stumbled backwards. The [Storm Captain] had drawn his sword and his metal gauntlet flashed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I should have known a crew like this would have one or two traitors. But you served on my ship four years. What did it take?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just gold, Cap'n. No hard feelings, eh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Begal was smiling widely, desperately as he backed up. Captain Lasc aimed his shortsword at the man's chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who hired you? How many more are with you? Tell us—and I might not keelhaul you right where you stand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sailor] looked from side to side. His eyes darted. And then—he smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How many, Captain? More'n one or two. Looks like the jig's up, boys. Show Captain Lasc how many of us were bought."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a sound. Metal, sliding on metal. The crowd around Wil moved. [Sailors] stepped back. The crew of three hundred was on deck. And of that number—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Over two thirds of the crew drew their blades. Wil felt his stomach drop through the deck. Captain Lasc stared around, eyes wide. Delivan swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All of you? You salt-sucking traitors!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, Captain Lasc. But &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; heard that there'd be real treasure on this voyage. We've been keeping our &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; employers updated every day and night."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another [Sailor] spoke up. She had a hand-crossbow aimed at Delivan's chest. The loyal crew, less than a hundred, faced over two hundred mutineers. Wil looked to his side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky stood with the loyalists. So did the [Storm Sailors], all of them. The female [Sailor] didn't seem concerned as the [Storm Sailors] stood, looking around tensely, outnumbered two-to-one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know [Storm Sailors] are good, but you and the [Strategists] are flanked, Captain Lasc. Throw down your blade. The treasure belongs to our employers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mutineers nodded. Captain Lasc's jaw twitched. Wil saw Venaz tensing by the table. But he had two dozen blades aimed at him. Merrik and Peki were standing together. But there were so many—and they had the drop on Wil's side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's negotiate. You heard King Fetohep. The curse—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil croaked. He saw the female [Sailor] turn the crossbow towards him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I reckon that Fetohep will negotiate with whoever had the blades, boyo. And my bosses can defeat one curse. They know treasure. There's no negotiations."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Begal nodded. He bared his teeth. He opened his mouth, but the female [Sailor] spoke over him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Bloodtear Pirates will have the swords. And any man, woman, or Selphid who don't want to be slaughtered will surrender now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil stared at her in shock. So did the [Sailors]. Begal hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Bloodtear…? We're working for the Undersea Crews! Therrium himself's paying us, you idiot!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The female [Sailor] blinked. She turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Undersea Crews?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another [Sailor] laughed incredulously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're hired by Savere! Are you both &lt;em&gt;mad?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait—who's with Savere? And who's Bloodtear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm with the Screaming Sails. The Bloodtears are our &lt;em&gt;enemies!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another [Sailor] shouted. The organized mutineers looked at each other. They tried to point their blades at each other. And that was a mistake. Because one man knew whose side he was on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc. As the [Sailors] around him wavered, his hand moved. He stepped forwards and beheaded Begal. He turned, stabbed his sword through another [Sailor]'s face. And his fist moved. He struck four chins and the [Sailors] crumpled. The mutineers stared as the [Storm Captain] raised his blade. He brought it down, slashing &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the [Sailor] threatening Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;To me, [Storm Sailors]! Slaughter these mutinous dogs!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The stalemate erupted into chaos. Wil saw Venaz explode upwards. The mutineers began attacking Lasc's crew—and each other, shouting. Three stabbed Venaz in the back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur ignored the blades. He grabbed the table, lifted it with a roar and swung it &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; him. Wil dove as [Sailors] were sent flying by the blow. The Minotaur lifted the table and &lt;em&gt;threw&lt;/em&gt; it. A group of mutineers screamed as he drew a battleaxe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Form up! Wil! Get behind us!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola and Feshi were fighting next to Delivan. Inky and the [Storm Sailors] howled as they drew their blades and cut into the lower-level [Sailors]. Merrik had his hammer out. He ignored the weapons bouncing off his armor and charged into the fighting. Peki was already punching and kicking, striking every mutineer—and some of the loyalists—around her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil stood. He drew a sword and the emergency wand he carried. He locked blades with a traitorous [Sailor]. The man was &lt;em&gt;strong. &lt;/em&gt;He raised his off-hand as Wil raised his wand. Both of them stared at the wand aimed at each other's chests. They shouted and dodged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A bolt of fire hit Wil in his chest. But his enchanted armor that Yerranola had made him wear took the spell. The other man was not so lucky. He fell with a hole in his neck. Wil turned, aiming his wand, slashing—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Battalion of Glory]! Use your damn Skills! Peki! Yerra! Wil! Get back here, Venaz!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik howled at the students. They began activating their skills and Lasc's loyalists formed a formation against the disorganized mutineers. Too late, the traitors realized they had to work together or die. They tried to rally. But they were unprepared for the students being able to use their Skills. Merrik and Peki.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Captain Lasc's wrath. The [Storm Captain] pointed, and the deck erupted with a line of spikes, impaling dozens of the traitors. He was a blur, as his armored fist struck faces and deflected blades and even bolts and spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His blade cut down traitor after traitor. The battle was short and swift. Wil was pointing his wand at a fleeing [Sailor] when Feshi's arrow took the female traitor in the back of the head. He looked around for another enemy, but they were all dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The deck was a massacre. Some of the traitors had surrendered. The rest had died. The [Storm Sailors] were panting. Their levels, aided by the [Strategists], had triumphed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But—&lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; ran red with blood. And less than a hundred crew remained. Wil found Lasc, leaned on a railing. The [Storm Captain] wasn't hurt badly. His wounds were already healing via potion. But he looked—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Lasc?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Traitors. I thought there might be. But not among my own crew. Some of them stayed with me for years, like that bastard, Begal, Lord Kallinad. But the ones who stuck around were—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc raised his head. Wil saw Inky helping fix up Venaz. The Minotaur had hacked apart [Sailors] but they'd cut into him without his armor. The Octopus-Woman grinned in response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Storm Sailors] don't jump ship so easily, mates. Even those of us who belong to the sea. Captain, what do we do with them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was staring at the traitors with his crossbow loaded and aimed. Lasc spoke curtly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They go over the plank. Or put a bolt in their heads, Delivan. Then get me any [Sailor] who can move."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aye, Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Lasc?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil stared at the [Sailors] as they were ordered towards the sides. Some just climbed the railings and jumped; the others pleaded as Lasc strode towards the wheel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If their mates are in the area, they'll live. Otherwise they can pray for Nelgaunts or the sea's mercy. I don't care. We can't hold them and I won't risk it. Lord Kallinad, we have to &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;. We're being &lt;em&gt;scried.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] pointed up. Wil realized what he meant. His heart leapt. But his mind—began to move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can't cancel the scrying spell, Captain Lasc. They have us via remote surveillance, not a scrying spell. But we can &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; the spell if we sail through fog or anything to obstruct it. I heard at least &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; different groups being shouted at us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So did I. Each one dangerous names. We can't fight any of 'em. Not with a third of my crew. We sail for the House of Minos at once! &lt;em&gt;To the sails! Get me my emergency items!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc roared. [Sailors] ran. They were understaffed, but there were enough to do the work. Wil saw the boom turning; he looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Merrik! Get the scrying orb!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why? So we can see that idiot who's given us away?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf groused. Wil pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So we can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; who's coming after us! Venaz! Contact the House of Minos!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I need a [Message] spell!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur ran belowdecks. Wil saw Captain Lasc gritting his teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're less than a day away. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; I use all of my [Gale] scrolls. We'll blow a maelstrom into our sails, Lord Kallinad. But I don't know if—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He broke off. Wil saw the [Captain] stare at something past his head. Wil felt a shadow fall over his back. He heard a sound, roaring water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, he turned. A warship had surfaced next to &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. And a Drowned Man stood on the railings, looking down at the two. He was half-Eel, his body rubbery. And he wore a [Captain]'s hat. He aimed a sword down at the crew as he spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;I am Captain Therrium of &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow.&lt;/em&gt; The ship behind you is &lt;em&gt;The Sinking Light&lt;/em&gt;. We are the Undersea Crews. Surrender the treasure to us and you will live. Resist—and die.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Man's crew stood at the railings. Aiming weapons down. Wil froze. He saw Captain Lasc hesitate. And then take his hand off the wheel. Slowly, he raised his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Salt take me. How long were you there? We watched the sea—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;From the beginning. We dove lower than your eyes, [Storm Captain].&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A woman with a starfish's body on her right half grinned down at Lasc. And on the other side—the other Drowned Ship was closing. Wil Kallinad closed his eyes. He heard boot steps on the deck. And then—the Drowned Folk were herding the [Sailors] into the center of the boat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola shouted. The students had their weapons out, but the Drowned Crew surrounded them. Captain Therrium glanced dismissively at Peki and Merrik as they backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Hold your blades, landfolk. I don't intend to spill your blood. And I would have let you pick up the last of the treasure. But those idiots leaked too much information. So. This is it?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He scowled, but smiled as he strode over to Kheltian casket. The crew was frozen as the Drowned Folk clustered around. Therrium sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Ah&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're making an enemy of the Titan of Baleros, Captain Therrium. And House Kallinad. I beg you, don't do this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil's heart was breaking. He saw the [Depth Captain] turn his head. The man smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I fear no landman, [Lordling]. Open the casket."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed at a [Depth Sailor]. Cautiously, the man did—using an oar. Therrium sighed as the diamond blades flashed with light. He nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;We'll take nothing else. Grab the casket and put it on my ship. Leave the landfolk unless they resist.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He strode past Wil as the Drowned Crew cheered. Well—the ones from the other ship looked disgruntled, but a group of the [Depth Sailors] seized the chest. Wil stared at Therrium. The Drowned Man paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;It's nothing personal, Lord Kallinad. You did much that even seafolk acknowledge. But your adventure was failed from the start. Thank yon friends for it.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded at Venaz and Yerranola. They paled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm so sorry, Wil—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola began. Venaz clenched his fists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't suppose you'd accept a duel, Captain Therrium?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;And spill blood needlessly? No, Minotaur. I'm a practical [Captain]. No fool, like Rasea. We'll be gone without blood spilled—well, other than already spilled. And let the world see how the Undersea Crews work.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Captain spoke, looking at the sky. Then he glanced around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The scrying orb was still there. The [Mages] had enhanced it as much as possible, but it was barely more than an aerial view. But the [Depth Captain] was still visible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And—Captain Therrium ignored Noass babbling about the 'exciting and unexpected new developments'. He narrowed his eyes at the Drowned Man with a half-Crab body. Seborn stared into the picture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Ah. My boy.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium spoke slowly. He reached for the orb. Seborn's eyes narrowed. He cut off the Drake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Noass. I recognize that [Depth Captain] and crew.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You &lt;em&gt;do?&lt;/em&gt; Tell us—who are they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Rogue] spoke slowly. And it was as if he locked eyes with his father from afar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;That would be &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow,&lt;/em&gt; one of the Undersea Crews. And the [Depth Captain] is Captain Therrium Sailwinds.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sailwinds? Um—no relation?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Noass grinned. Seborn folded his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Relation. Captain Therrium is a lawless [Thief]. Despised even by other Drowned Folk for &lt;em&gt;not honoring his word. &lt;/em&gt;A backstabbing shrimp.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crew of &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; jolted to a stop. They slowly turned to stare at Captain Therrium. The [Depth Captain]'s eyes narrowed. But then he grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Arrogant brat. I'll give him his dues with this. And a lashing, which he also deserves. Load it up! And hurry! I don't intend to stick around! I want us diving and out of range in five minutes!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He roared at his crew. They lugged the chest towards the ship. Wil helplessly watched. His mind spun with ideas—all of which Niers would have termed 'death-inviting'. Therrium was just…too cautious. He kept his crew on the decks, aiming their weapons at&lt;em&gt; The Emerald Signet. &lt;/em&gt;Perhaps if Captain Lasc used [Depth Explosion]? But—that probably only worked &lt;em&gt;underwater.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And—the Bloodtear Pirates weren't here. No one was coming. So, as the Drowned Folk carried the casket, the [King] sighed. He raised one hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Sand flurried up from the casket, blowing the lid open. A figure rose from the deck as Therrium whirled. An undead [King] stood on the decks. His eyes flashed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thieves. The Swords of Serept are not yours to take. Begone from this vessel."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep of Khelt looked at Therrium. The [Depth Captain] recoiled, and then his eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Fetohep of Khelt.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded, slightly. The ruler of Khelt's flaming sockets flashed with light. He turned his head and the Drowned Crew froze. The ones holding the casket hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Relinquish my treasure to this ship, Drowned Man. It is not yours to take."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Depth Captain] glanced at Fetohep, and then at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;And if I were to promise they'd reach Khelt? They will not by &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet. &lt;/em&gt;The ship is mine, as are its treasures. But I'd not be averse to taking the same offer. Three blades, for a lifetime.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep's gaze had been flashing silent ire at Wil. Slowly, his head rotated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did you mishear me, mortal? I gave you an order."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium was taken aback.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;You…intend for me to put the treasure I've taken back? What of your deal?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead ruler sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mortals. You seem to not understand. My offer extends &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; to Wil Kallinad. Gratitude to the one who discovered my artifacts. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a ransom. And you have taken this ship? What of it? My treasure is &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;. I do not negotiate with thieves."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He grinned that undead grin. The [Depth Captain] heard a muffled laugh. Venaz turned his head away. But the Minotaur was smiling too. Captain Therrium put a hand on his sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;I see. In that case—I'll have to claim the Swords of Serept forever. [First Mate]?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raised his Human hand. A Drowned Woman pointed her wand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;[Dispel Magic].&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep's form—wavered. The sand lost its cohesion. It fell to the deck, dissipating. Therrium snorted. Sand instantly began to whip around the chest, and the crew shouted, trying to hold onto it. But the [Depth Captain] only pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curses.&lt;/em&gt; I've seen the sand trick. Hold it down.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Anchor Lash]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of his [Depth Sailors] pointed. A pair of anchors flew and lashed around the chest. The sand stopped lifting it up. Therrium waved the crew onwards as Wil's heart sank. The [Depth Sailors] grabbed at the chest again. One of them, a half-Shrimp Drowned Man who'd been very hurt by Seborn's comment, grabbed the handle. Then, puzzled, he looked down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A hand was grabbing &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; arm. It was made of sand. And Fetohep's face rose out of the box and the sand reformed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Fool.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;[The Desiccation of Zeikhal].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Before Wil's eyes, the Drowned Man—dried up. He turned into a mummy as the water was sucked from his body. A corpse. And then—his form dried up further. He fell to the ground, turning to dust. Only some yellowed bone remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Crews stared at the dust. The ones holding the casket let go. It instantly clattered to the deck. Fetohep rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have earned my wr—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium rolled his eyes and pointed a wand. The bolt of magic blew apart Fetohep's head. He turned to his [First Mate].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Lash the damn chest to the side of my ship. He can't use the sand trick underwater. We'll blast it with as many [Dispel Magic] spells as we need to.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Aye, Depth Captain! Grab the chest! Use ropes, idiots!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] shouted. The Drowned Crew moved, throwing grapples. But before they could grab the casket—it shot open, &lt;em&gt;snapping&lt;/em&gt; the anchor ropes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time a raging whirlwind of sand rose into the air. It engulfed all three ships. Wil shielded his face—but the sand only affected the Drowned Crews. They shouted, stumbling around. And a figure materialized in front of the stunned crew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Begin sailing, Kallinad. The sand will rage for ten minutes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep of Khelt's flaming eyes stared at Wil. The [Lord] saw Captain Lasc jerk. Figures were rising out of the sands, attacking the Drowned Crews. Therrium whirled, hacking them apart with ease, but they kept coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hurry. That Drowned Captain…&lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be able to combat the lesser elements of my curse. I do not care to waste my time on him. You have your chance. If you lose the chest again, I will recover it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] glowered. Wil nodded. He turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain Lasc!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] was running for his wheel. The [Sailors] scrambled, cutting loose mooring lines. Captain Therrium saw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You were warned! Cut them all down!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He tried to fight clear of the sands. His crews did likewise. They saw figures moving in the screen of sand. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A table? It &lt;em&gt;crashed&lt;/em&gt; into a group of Drowned Sailors. And Captain Therrium saw a group of forty [Storm Sailors]. Inky, and Merrik and Peki in front. The [Strategists] stood at their backs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Unit: Enhanced Strength]. [Unstoppable Advance]. [Arrowguard Formation]…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was murmuring Skills. At the same time, the other three [Strategists] were doing the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Lucky Dodge]. [Keen Blades]. [Ram's Charge]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil pointed at Therrium. The [Depth Captain] recoiled. He saw more sand-warriors coming out of the sandstorm whirling around him. And—four [Strategists] plus two [Commanders] were combining their abilities. He spun around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Back to the ship! Fall back!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Crews needed no encouragement. They streamed back to the ship. Wil exhaled. He looked at Venaz. Then—they turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Unit: Enhanced Strength]! [Unstoppable Advance]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur began chanting again as Wil and the other [Storm Sailors] faced the second crew. The other [Depth Captain] saw Wil pointing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Ram's Charge]. [Blades of Glory]! [Everpiercing Swords]! [Unit: Form of Giants]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] saw her face pale. She shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Retreat! Let them burn their Skills!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her crew ran, as the sand-apparitions followed. Wil grinned. He didn't have [Blades of Glory], or the other Skills he was shouting. The [Storm Sailors] rushed forwards, cutting the lines. Venaz was laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Neither crew realized or remembered they'd used the Skills in a battle not ten minutes ago! They had to recharge! It didn't take either [Depth Captain] long to realize the trick. They howled, but the gangplanks and ropes had been thrown off the ship. And &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;After them!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium was red in the face. He saw the [Storm Captain] unfurling a scroll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Galewinds]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc shouted. Instantly, a breeze filled &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet's&lt;/em&gt; sails. It shot forwards as the two Drowned Ships turned. And still—the sandstorm was battering the two ships.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For six more minutes. Captain Therrium was shielding his face. He cursed Fetohep's magical protections. He'd grab the chest and strip them one layer at a time. He knew &lt;em&gt;curses!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Emerald Signet emerged from the sandstorm with the two Drowned Ships in hot pursuit. Captain Lasc had a death-grip on his ship's helm. His lookouts were shouting information as Delivan strode to the back of the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Permission to fire ship-spells, Captain?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Granted!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aye, sir! [Depth Explosion]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A blast rocked &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow.&lt;/em&gt; Therrium's ship listed for a second—but it was reinforced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn! They have armor on them! These aren't ordinary Drowned Ships! And they're &lt;em&gt;fast!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not as fast as we are! Which is why they're throwing spells! &lt;em&gt;Brace!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky shouted. She was halfway up the mast, staring backwards. She dropped to the deck as magical bolts of light began shooting from the other ships.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dead gods, that's a bombardment spell! Watch out! Those are [Light Spears]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dozens of the oversized magical arrows were hitting &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. Wil saw one burn a [Sailor] off her feet. He took cover behind the mast with the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Take cover! We're gaining! We're headed straight for the House of Minos!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc bellowed, ignoring the spells raining down around him. Two tore through the sails and he swore as the spells caught the fabric on fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Douse those flames! Get to cover and get the wounded belowdecks! Drop all unnecessary cargo!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was steering the ship, trading some speed for a slight variation in their movement. A huge blast of fire missed the sails as Lasc spun the wheel, anticipating it. Helplessly, the students could only watch the other two ships gaining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have to do something!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"King Fetohep—can you help—King Fetohep?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil turned. The casket was inert again. Merrik swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. I knew something was up! The 'curse' must have limited magic! No wonder the [King] wanted us to take the casket!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry. A [Storm Ship] can outmaneuver Drowned Ships. And Lasc has a final option if we keep our distance. We can do this—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was reassuring the others as he peered from the bow, using the few ship-spells Lasc had available to him through his bond as [First Mate]. Wil saw the other ships slowing a bit, even as they used their own wind spells to fill their sails. They were indeed slower; they were heavier in the water, built for withstanding pressure in the depths as well as above the sea!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But something made Wil loathe to celebrate. He turned his head. And his mind recalled a pertinent detail. Just in time too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain! Ships from dead ahead! They're flying [Pirate] flags!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategists] looked up. None of them looked surprised. On the other hand, the sailors whirled, looking alarmed. Captain Lasc stared ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Those flags. Those are the Bloodtear Pirates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky went dead white. Feshi poked her head up as she aimed a bow at the ships to the rear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Any relation to the Bloodfeast Raiders? It's a very common name, yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Maybe because both groups slaughter anyone they catch!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan shouted. Feshi paled. Wil saw Captain Lasc turn his head desperately, but it was the &lt;em&gt;sea.&lt;/em&gt; There wasn't much room to maneuver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And—if the Drowned Ships were slower, the Bloodtear Pirates were not. Their sails were filled with magical wind and they were as fast as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Maybe…faster?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil saw the [Storm Captain] turn his head again, and then caught his eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad! Anything you and your friends can do would be appreciated!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil started. And then he realized—the [Captain] was asking him for help. Inky, Delivan—the [Storm Sailors] were outmatched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet, Wil knew nothing of the ocean. On the other hand…he narrowed his eyes as he saw the approaching Bloodtear Pirates. The pursuing Drowned Ships. And he realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; was his forte. A battle. It didn't matter where or when. He knew little of the majesty of the sea. But war? He glanced at his fellow classmates. This was all they did. Wil took a breath as his mind began to race.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Absolutely not. But I'll listen to your idea and decide which one's best."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur grinned. Yerranola looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You two have ideas too?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Almost like a time quiz, but the deadline is death. Eh, Peki?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik was calculating something on his fingers. Feshi nodded. The students broke into a huddle as the [Sailors] stared. Inky looked at Delivan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're mad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Landlubbers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action, Drama, Reaction, and More Action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear Pirates stormed through the seas towards &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; and the pursuing Drowned Ships. They flew the colors of [Pirates]. And they issued no [Messages], shouted nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had only one desire when they hunted. They were quite genial other times. But on the chase? Never.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They saw the pursuit and closed on &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; at all speed. Three ships. Captain Therrium hesitated when he saw them, but he bore on, cursing. It was a race to the treasure, nothing else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear Pirates were readying attack spells when they saw something &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt; from the first ship. A Garuda flew off &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. She raced ahead of the boat, screaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Help, help! We've been attacked by Drowned Folk!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She didn't seem to notice the [Pirate] flags. The Bloodtear Pirates exchanged glances. The lead [Captain] saw the colorful Garuda flying at them. Definitely a landlubber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Heave to!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bellowed. The [Pirates] aimed at the Garuda. She landed on the deck, crying, in front of the [Captain.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But they're trying to &lt;em&gt;kill&lt;/em&gt; us! They stole the treasure! But they want to kill us all!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They did?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] stared at Peki. He eyed the water dribbling down her cheeks. She didn't seem to be actually…crying. She nodded. The Bloodtear Captain glanced at his crew. He shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Capture her. Get all three ships. We'll have to sink them all, anyways."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda stared at the [Captain] as he grinned at her behind the helm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're going to attack us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He laughed. Peki thought about this and shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay. Watch the boom."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Huh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She &lt;em&gt;kicked&lt;/em&gt; the wheel. The [Captain] swore, grabbing, but a foot kicked him off his feet. He went tumbling—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And his ship &lt;em&gt;turned&lt;/em&gt; as the boom swung around. It crashed into the second ship, and both slowed. Peki flew off as the Bloodtear Pirates loosed spells and arrows after her back. The [Martial Artist] nimbly dodged. They ruled the seas, but she had trained to fight in the air. Everything but booms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The third ship came on, though. It was on a collision course with &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;! Desperately, the Storm Ship turned, but the pirate ship turned to catch it. They too had a magical wind in their sails. A magical wind—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Galewinds]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki flapped past them and cast the scroll. The [Pirate Captain] of the third ship looked up as a second wind blew &lt;em&gt;crossways&lt;/em&gt;, blasting the sail around. He swore as the ship &lt;em&gt;turned&lt;/em&gt; against his will. He began to fight the two winds as Peki flapped off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, the old, 'distract them with Peki', and then 'catch them off-guard with Peki again gambit'. Classic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik chortled as he watched &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet &lt;/em&gt;racing past the ships. All three turned to join the chase. Now—&lt;em&gt;five &lt;/em&gt;ship's worth of spells were flying at &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet's &lt;/em&gt;rear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Gnoll braced behind cover as she stared at Merrik. Peki landed on the deck, panting, but only slightly singed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How often do you use that tactic?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'd be surprised."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Our turns.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil and Venaz appeared at one side of the ship. They winced as a hail of [Fireballs] exploded around the sails.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sails are down! Replace them now!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;We need five minutes!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky howled as Captain Lasc felt his ship slow. Desperately, the [Storm Captain] looked over his shoulder. The other ships were coming alongside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Board them and take the treasure! Repel the Bloodtear Pirates!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium was howling as his ship exchanged fire with the others. Ahead, &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet, &lt;/em&gt;floundering, was throwing up a white flag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kill them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] pointed. But he saw Wil, Venaz, and Yerra dragging something to the port.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stop! Stop! We surrender! We'll give you the casket! But kill us and it goes over!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil shouted. All five ships stopped. They drew alongside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;It's a trick!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The first mate opined. Therrium peered through a spyglass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. It's the real casket! They can't create a fake although—get me a [Detect Magic] spell!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was the casket. Genuine. One of the Bloodtear Pirate ships streamed forwards and the other Drowned Ship, &lt;em&gt;The Sinking Light&lt;/em&gt;, rammed them. They began to fight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Give us the treasure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another of the Bloodtear Pirates was blocking &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow. &lt;/em&gt;Fearless, their crews were boarding, hacking at Therrium's crew. The Drowned Man slashed through the enemy as he roared, trying to get his ship closer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] had a crossbow aimed at Wil's head and the [Pirates] were poised to catch. Wil nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Open the casket."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] was in no mood to play games or be tricked again. Wil slowly did so. The diamond swords shone from within the casket. The [Pirate Captain] stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get me a null magic net. And hand it over."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, the [Strategists] balanced it on the railing. The Bloodtear Pirates &lt;em&gt;yanked&lt;/em&gt; it away. They stared at the treasure, forgetting &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; for a second. One of the [Pirates] reached for a shimmering blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stop, idiot! Wait for the net—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] saw a hand grab the unlucky [Pirate]. Fetohep rose, sighing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He didn't cast a spell. Sand just flooded the [Pirate]'s nose, mouth, eyes, ears—she fell back, choking. The Bloodtear Pirates drew back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Neutralize the magic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] ordered. Fetohep looked at him. He glanced to the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is tedious. But amusing in its own way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead [King] pronounced. He said that, but he was grinning. Always grinning. The [Pirates] turned as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; shot forwards again; the sails were full and restored. The [Pirate Captain] frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do we pursue, Captain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…No. Let them go. We'll deal with the spectre and the two Drowned Ships."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] came to a quick decision. He looked around. A pair of [Pirates] had a net that cancelled magic and were sneaking up on Fetohep's left. The [King] pointed a finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magical sand blasted the ambushers. Then, the undead [King] lifted his other hand. A whirlwind blasted the [Pirates] back. It whirled under the casket, pushed it &lt;em&gt;up.&lt;/em&gt; And—to the disbelief of the [Pirate Captain], the casket &lt;em&gt;flew&lt;/em&gt; through the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It landed on &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; as the ship stormed ahead. Wil saw Fetohep rise from the casket as the Bloodtear [Pirate Captain] screamed curses and resumed the chase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I warned you that once you lost the casket, I would grant you no more chances."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, your Majesty. What about a ruse?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of Fetohep's burning flames in his eye sockets flashed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I shall consider it amusing. Show me how you continue to struggle, young [Lord]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear Pirates and Drowned Crews stopped fighting as they realized &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was getting away again. They continued chasing, fighting each other as well as the ship ahead. And now—the [Strategists] were in their element.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You want one of the swords? &lt;/em&gt;Fetch!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi howled. She heaved over a glittering blade into the sea. One of the Drowned Ships began to dive until Therrium cursed the other [Depth Pirate] out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;It's made of glass, you idiot!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Glass and string. Nice try, Feshi. My turn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra consoled the heartbroken Gnoll. The other [Strategists] were trying another trick. They dumped the barrels of liquor overboard. And as they floated towards the other ship, Feshi loosed an arrow for Yerra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Bursting Arrow]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The barrels &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; with fire. The other ships swerved. The [Strategists] were laughing, trying to exchange ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Peki, fly one of the spare sails in front of the other ships! Blind them!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, we'll have you attack the rudders! Anyone got a powerful wand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were throwing ideas around left and right. Peki took into the air and began dropping explosive alchemical flasks Feshi had brought, from out of arrow range. But the other ships were coming on, doggedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a chase. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; had managed to gain a five-minute lead. And it kept to it; it was lighter in the water with less weight. And the Bloodtear Pirates, for all two were smaller ships, were fighting it out with the Drowned Crews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For all that, it was neck and neck. And—Captain Lasc looked at his stash of emergency wind scrolls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three left."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We just need to get in range of the House of Minos! I've sent a distress call!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz shouted. He was staring ahead, trying to see the distant archipelago. But they were still far distant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How many ships are in the area? How fast are they coming to rendezvous?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil turned his head, trying to calculate over the map table. Venaz looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, we just need to get &lt;em&gt;in range&lt;/em&gt; of the isles! We'll have support! We're nearly—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash.&lt;/em&gt; Something from behind. Wil turned his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What was—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Harpoons! They just shot them into our hull!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik howled. One of the Bloodtear Pirates had launched the metal harpoons. Inky raced up from belowdecks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're taking on water! I need hands below! Help me patch up—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;More explosions. The other ships were loosing more spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods. They're recharged. Captain Lasc! We might not survive a volley! It'll tear us apart—leave us dead in the water at the least!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan hunkered down as spells rained around &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; The [Storm Captain] bit his lip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could use my last card, but we might all perish. Lord Kallinad! Have you anything left?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not unless King Fetohep aids us. I think—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil ducked his head as something shredded the command deck. Lasc fell back, swearing; something had opened his shoulder. He looked back; the ships were gaining; they'd put more holes in the sails.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Here they came. Therrium was in front this time. The Drowned Man's blade was bared. Captain Lasc slowly drew his blade and planted it in the deck. He turned back to staring ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain Lasc! A ship to the port!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Another&lt;/em&gt; [Pirate]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola shouted hopelessly. But Venaz' head had turned. He snatched Delivan's spyglass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! That's a warship from the House of Minos! Keep going! We're going to make it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He grinned wildly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just &lt;em&gt;one?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young [Lord] looked alarmed. There were &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt; ships in pursuit! And this Minotaurian Warship didn't look &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much bigger! In fact, it was turning in the distance!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is it not engaging?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! It's—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Captain, warship ahead! It flies the colors of House Minos!"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Sailor called down to Therrium. His head rose as he hunkered down, avoiding flaming arrows from the damned Bloodtear Pirate ships. He looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"We're already in Minos' waters? Damn. &lt;em&gt;Catch that ship! Fire all spells!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed at &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. His [First Mate] moved to obey. She strode to the front of the ship. Therrium saw a flash. He raised his head, then felt something &lt;em&gt;hit&lt;/em&gt; his ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;What was that?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He roared. Then he saw a plume of splinters. His [First Mate] stared at her missing legs. Then—at the ballista bolt made of metal that had &lt;em&gt;shattered&lt;/em&gt; the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The warship is firing at us! Damned Minotaurs!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear Pirates saw the impact on &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow.&lt;/em&gt; One of the [Pirate Captains] saw the warship presenting broadsides, far, &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; in the distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then close with them and destroy the ship! They can't reload in—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splash&lt;/em&gt;. The [Pirates] ducked as something &lt;em&gt;hit&lt;/em&gt; the waters next to their ship. Another ballista bolt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So they have two ballistae. So wh—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crack&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; ballista bolt hit the side of the ship. The Bloodtear Pirates looked up. Then—a stone &lt;em&gt;cracked&lt;/em&gt; into the decks of the other Drowned Ship. The boat rocked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three ballistae and a catapult. Damn. Fine then—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another&lt;/em&gt; bolt hit the decks. The [Pirates] slowly turned to look at their [Captain]. He snatched a spyglass up. Impossible. They couldn't have &lt;em&gt;four—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The warship had four. And a catapult in the center. As the [Captain] watched, he saw distant figures reloading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They did it like this. Two Minotaurs &lt;em&gt;pulled&lt;/em&gt; the arm of the catapult down. One slammed a boulder out of a bag of holding into the firing arm—the catapult was adjusted and fired. In less than thirty seconds, another boulder was in the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the ballistae? Just as fast. Minotaurs just &lt;em&gt;pulled&lt;/em&gt; the massive siege weapon back, reloading it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Devils in the deep.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear [Pirate Captain] had heard stories. But the Minotaurs surprised him. They kept firing; before a bolt landed, another was in the air. All five ships began to take evasive action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium was swearing. But he pointed his ship ahead at &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bring down the Minotaur's warship first! This isn't over! Send out a call to any Undersea Crews nearby!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaurs weren't even using &lt;em&gt;spells.&lt;/em&gt; Wil stared. They just had siege weapons, but the weapons had incredible &lt;em&gt;range.&lt;/em&gt; And the Minotaurs were expert marksmen. They were pumping out a rain of fire that the other ships had to dodge or be sunk by, even with [Reinforced Hulls].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods! I had no idea that's how Minotaurs &lt;em&gt;fought!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola was staring. Venaz was laughing proudly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No [Pirates] challenge our waters! Well—a few do, but most know better! Minotaur warships are a terror of the seas! And we fight on land just as well! I &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; you—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students looked at each other. Venaz' boasts were being backed up a bit—if only by the dramatic save. The Minotaur stood on the prow, bellowing towards the distant ship. Wil heard an answering roar back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But—Lasc kept glancing back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're still coming, Mister Venaz! And they might be damned experts at close quarters, but they'll be outnumbered five-to-one! Those are all expert, high-level [Pirates]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry, Captain Lasc. The other ships won't make it. See?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaurian ship was moving backwards, as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; fled in its wake. But the other ships kept coming; they were &lt;em&gt;tough&lt;/em&gt; and even the impacts from the ballista bolts and catapults weren't doing more than &lt;em&gt;slowing&lt;/em&gt; them. Wil glanced over his shoulder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz? Are you &lt;em&gt;sure?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He could see Captain Therrium in the distance. The [Depth Captain] was pointing. And—Wil heard someone swearing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My [Dangersense] is going off. Captain Lasc—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan looked backwards. An [Archer] was standing on the deck. Lasc peered through a spyglass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Damn&lt;/em&gt;. No wonder the Bloodtear Pirates have abandoned attacking &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow.&lt;/em&gt; Everyone! &lt;em&gt;Get belowdecks! They've got a poison archer!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked up. Lasc pointed at the [Archer] that Therrium had placed on the prow. She was sighting—and she was half-Drowned. Wil saw yellowish skin, something like…spikes? He saw her spitting something. Lasc pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Blowfish. One dose from her arrows and you're dead."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crew ran for the decks. Wil looked at Venaz. Within a few more minutes, they'd be in range. No—were they already? Therrium was pointing at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stop your ship or die. This is your last chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned man shouted. One of the Bloodtear Pirates was accelerating, using a skill on the right. Wil saw Lasc's eyes flick from left to right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mister Venaz—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hold course. We're nearly safe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur crouched behind the safety of the deck, but he looked—confident. Wil saw the Minotaur vessel turning ahead, offering more covering fire. But the two ships were catching up to the wounded Storm Ship. Wil saw Therrium raise a hand. The [Archer] drew back, sighting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the Bloodtear Pirate ship began to draw alongside. The [Pirates] whirled grappling hooks, shouting. Wil saw Lasc bare his teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Prepare to repel boarders!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He reached for his sword, planted in the deck. Wil reached for his blade, staring at the casket. He saw Venaz looking up at the sky as the Bloodtear Pirates' ship drew alongside. Wil looked back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Time to fight. Wil, stay behind us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola rose, Merrik and Peki by her side. Feshi reached for another arrow. And Wil saw Venaz close his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Her wrath. Honor to you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He stood. Wil looked up at him. And then—he saw a shadow flash across the sky. Venaz knelt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] drawing alongside &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; looked up. He saw something flying through the sky. Rotating. It fell towards him. He stared up. It looked like—but it was too large.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that…an &lt;em&gt;axe?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It cut through the mast, crashed through the deck and the [Captain]. The ship &lt;em&gt;buckled&lt;/em&gt;, and then—sank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium stared at the gigantic axe buried in the ship. He stared at the sky. He reached for the helm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear Pirates turned. The Minotaur warship launched another volley, but the other four ships fled. Fled, in a moment. For reinforcements, to regroup. They asked no questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was an axe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Axes, the Minotaur [Prince], a Moment's Peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What in the name of the Grandfathers was &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik stared at the place the ship had sunk. Wil looked at Venaz. The Minotaur replied calmly, smirking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That. Was an axe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students looked at him. The other ships were fleeing. Wil turned to Peki.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peki, punch Venaz."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda raised a fist. The Minotaur stepped back, scowling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was what I meant! We're in range of the House of Minos. Well—it must have expanded last I checked. She leveled."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She? Who?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain! Lord Kallinad! Minotaur warship is turning! They want to board!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky called out from the crow's nest. Venaz's head turned. But he pointed at the place the Bloodtear Pirates' ship had sunk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Her range. That axe was thrown by the King of Minotaurs herself. It was her great Skill. One of the reasons we are &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;. The [Axe of Gigant]. A shipbreaking blow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed into the distance. Wil saw the other warship drawing alongside. He looked at Venaz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz. I've known [Kings]. Even the King of Destruction. We &lt;em&gt;studied&lt;/em&gt; him. I've never, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; seen a Skill like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Because your [Kings] were rulers. Our King won her title by strength, Wil. Strength and honor. And her class, her first class? Was [Axe Thrower]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur warship was filled with Minotaurs. And like Venaz, they had knelt the direction the axe had come. Now—Wil saw Venaz pointing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The waters were stirring. Something rose, from where the [Pirate]'s ship had sunk. An axe rose out of the waters and slowly flew back the way it had come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was much smaller than when it had landed. But it flashed through the air, rotating. Wil and the others stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The pride of the Minotaurs. Be honored, Wil Kallinad. For you, our King threw one of her personal weapons. She does not do it often; even most [Pirates] do not know of her strength."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz beamed. Wil nodded, speechless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And are we…safe?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik looked up at Venaz. He nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So long as we remain here? Of course! We'll have time to replenish our stocks. Repair the ship. And perhaps even sail with a fleet as an escort—depending on if Kallinad can pay for it. But once we reach the House of Minos' harbors even The Iron Vanguard would fear to invade!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He laughed, spreading his arms wide. Wil looked ahead. The other warship was moving alongside theirs. He saw the ballistae, the catapult. And—striding alongside the decks, his arms spread in welcome, a Minotaur in full armor. Venaz's eyes widened. He turned to Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And here I thought we couldn't get more lucky. Wil—you'll have the honor of being escorted by a &lt;em&gt;Prince&lt;/em&gt; of Minotaurs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Prince?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil stared at the distant Minotaur. Venaz was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As you understand it. He is next in line for the throne. Excluding our King's son—this would be her younger brother. As honorable as she is. And nearly as mighty. Er—he's not the one I beat to take the Professor's classes. Don't tell him I bragged about that. And be respectful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was older, gray mixed into his mane and fur. But as big as Venaz. He roared a greeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Venaz of Hammerad! In the name of the House of Minos, I welcome you home!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Prince Khedal! The honor is ours! Your timing was most fortuitous!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Minotaurs strode up the gangplanks as the ships docked. Khedal was a unit of a Minotaur, even as they reckoned such things. He and Venaz struck each other on the shoulders and grabbed each other's forearms as they locked horns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he had a &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt;, like that of the [General] of Pheislant. A high-level person. He turned to Wil as Venaz began to introduce the crew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Lord Kallinad. I have seen your story unfolding. It is the privilege of the House of Minos to aid you, as well as one of our own."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He inclined his head. And he was suddenly, incredibly formal. He gave Wil a bow—a Terandrian courtier's bow. It was impressively done. Wil found himself fumbling his reply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The honor was ah, mine, Prince Khedal. Your warship was timely. And the aid of your Que—your King was impressive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Khedal was nodding. His horns were actually gilded with silver—and his armor was as ornamental as functional. Wil saw dozens of Minotaur [Sailors] hard at work; the [Storm Sailors] eyed them nervously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The King of Minos directed our ship to your defense as soon as she saw you were inbound. That she provided the honor of her Skill was unasked for."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I shall surely thank her. And if my companions and I are worthy of it—we would be honored twice by an audience."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was nodding. Khedal studied Merrik, Peki, and the others. The Garuda whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strong Sea Cow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Prince's eyes narrowed. But then he was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Few are worthy, but she would wish it. And of course, we shall bring your ship to harbor. Come—have you replacement sails? If not, my [Oarsmen] will bring you to shore. It is not far."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned to Captain Lasc. The [Storm Captain] saluted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our sails are going up as we speak. It is an honor…Prince Khedal?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, it is. We were prepared to fight to the death in your defense. I do not know if it would have been fitting for those not of House Minos, or even one son. But our King is far wiser and more honorable than I."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur Prince nodded slightly. Lasc blinked. So did Wil. Khedal was somehow &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; uptight and arrogant than Venaz. Wil saw where he got it from if it was a cultural thing. However—he was also commanding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let us return to harbor before we speak more, Venaz of Hammerad. You have been gone too long. No doubt you will be feasted in the Thronehall of Minos. You must tell of us of your accomplishments. We have witnessed some, such as Daquin."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. I have failed as much as triumphed. But I hope to speak of the accomplishments of my companions as well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz hung his head as Khedal nodded. Wil felt his knees going weak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safety&lt;/em&gt;. He looked at Yerra and saw her and Feshi staring into the distance. Perhaps they were just shadows, but the Archipelago of the House of Minos awaited. A mysterious place. Wil looked back at the casket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And saw something on the horizon. The [Lord] stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz. Prince Khedal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Minotaurs turned. Wil pointed silently. Prince Khedal looked over his shoulder and frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Spyglass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One was placed into his hands. The Minotaur sighted. Then he looked up abruptly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It seems my boast of safety was premature. There is a &lt;em&gt;fleet&lt;/em&gt; approaching."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A fleet?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Storm Ships. &lt;em&gt;Sixty&lt;/em&gt; of them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sixty?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Prince-Commander Khedal. Another sighting. Southeast this time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur turned. He sighted again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Eighty warships."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A third call. Khedal looked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thirty six. Closer to forty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did he say &lt;em&gt;Storm Ships? &lt;/em&gt;That can only be—Lord Admiral Seagrass. &lt;em&gt;The Tyrant Seagrass.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan's eyes were wide. He looked at Lasc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But we've broken no laws of the sea, have we, Captain Lasc?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not a one. Perhaps Lord Seagrass is here to give us an escort."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. And perhaps my beard is a nest for baby chicks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik snorted. He looked at Prince Khedal. The Minotaur was consulting with his subordinates. He looked up, abruptly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We could sail for the House of Minos' shores. And repel this Lord Seagrass. We have clashed with his ships before. He will never take Minos' shores. However. I do not believe this is wise. Not for a single son of Minos, and a treasure that is not ours."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Wil. The [Lord] numbly nodded. Venaz looked at Khedal, clenching his fists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But Prince Khedal—! Are we to surrender the treasure after all this time? Fetohep of Khelt has charged &lt;em&gt;Wil&lt;/em&gt; with delivering it! Do we bow to dishonor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Khedal's hand moved like a blur. He grabbed Venaz so hard Wil saw the other Minotaur's armor move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Never.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Khedal's voice was low. He pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain Lasc! Head north! &lt;/em&gt;Now! We will sail past the House of Minos! Open the Bottle of Winds!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaurs leapt to follow Prince Khedal's orders. The Minotaur turned as he strode across the gangplank. He nodded at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I cannot in good conscience risk the life of our King and subjects in a siege if this Lord Seagrass would dare it. However—I have placed you under my protection. The least we can do is escort you closer to another harbor. We will delay this Lord Seagrass and his fleets as long as we are able. &lt;em&gt;Minotaurs! &lt;/em&gt;Make ready for battle!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A roar came from the warship. Venaz clung to the railing, looking alarmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Prince Khedal! &lt;/em&gt;You cannot risk your life! You are Prince to the House of Minos."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur turned back to Venaz. He looked gravely at the younger Minotaur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do not rule the House of Minos, Venaz of Hammerad. My life is worthless before that of my King. And honor is everything."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spread his arms, indicating the sea, the sky, the ship, the other Minotaurs. As proud as the sun. Fearless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil looked at Venaz. The Minotaur's jaw moved. Then he clasped a fist to his chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You do us the greatest of honors, Prince Khedal. We will not dishonor you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that was it. Captain Lasc was swearing as he moved his ship and the Minotaurian vessel kept pace. The two ships raced forwards, propelled by winds blown from a jar Khedal held.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was the final hour. Wil saw Fetohep rising from his casket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The world has not forgotten Khelt's treasures, it seems."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead [King] smiled. Wil looked at his friends. And in the distance—the fleet of over a hundred ships drew closer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Stormlord Captain] Seagrass. He uses his fleet to trade and make a fortune. He's tamed his parts of the sea. No one challenges him—he's a [King] of the waves."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky breathed. Wil looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If he's a [Stormlord], don't you owe your allegiance to him?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailor] grinned at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even a [Stormlord] doesn't command us [Storm Sailors]. We pledged to this cause and we'll…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She eyed the other navy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Run as long as possible and then surrender when we've done most of what we can. We might still make it. There's one trick Lasc has left. A [Storm Captain]'s desperation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Which is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lord Kallinad! To the prow! More ships ahead!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Alright! &lt;/em&gt;I'm done! Stop with the 'more ships'! It's getting ridiculous!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola threw down her hatchet on the deck and threw her hands up. She stomped up the deck with Wil. Lasc was calm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry, Miss Yerranola. I don't think we'll have more."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Don't reckon there are many more ships in the sea, Miss."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed. Ahead of them, Drowned Ships were rising out of the sea. Captain Therrium eyed the Minotaurian warship, and &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; as dozens of Drowned Ships rose around him. The Undersea Crews, all of them in the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From the west came an armada. Captain Lasc was counting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Bloodtear Pirates, the Death's Heads, the Salt Dogs—I see a dozen [Pirate] bands. More."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ooh, the &lt;em&gt;Death's Heads? &lt;/em&gt;They're Selphids. Maybe I can talk them out of killing us!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola stared into the distance. Merrik stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good. That leaves only…a few dozen warships. From &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; side."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Salt Dogs are Gnolls."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Think you can talk them out of fighting us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola looked at Feshi. The Gnoll [Strategist] shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. They're evil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students and [Sailors] stood at the railings. Looking around. Wil wondered aloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How did they all &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think everyone was following us already. Kind of flattering, when you think about it. What's our game, Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Toss the swords over the edge and pray they fight over it while we run?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola suggested. King Fetohep gave her a cold look. &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; seemed amused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I should mention this to Atwood."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil had no idea what that meant. And then—well—he saw the final ship show up. The last, fitting element.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A glowing ship on the horizon. It sped after both ships, faster than any other ship on the ocean. It shone with brilliant light. Wil recognized it now, the second time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary.&lt;/em&gt; And standing on the deck was Captain Rasea Zecrew. Yerranola called out as the ship sailed at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, thank &lt;em&gt;Rhir!&lt;/em&gt; They're going to save us! We can get on the ship, speed out of here—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ahoy! Looks like a real fight! Look at all these &lt;/em&gt;ships! I haven't seen so many in a decade in the same place! It was worth sticking around!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Rasea excitedly drew up alongside &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. The Minotaurian warship was turning and Prince Khedal was &lt;em&gt;staring&lt;/em&gt; at Captain Rasea with clear rage. The ballistae on her ship were duplicates of the ones on his warship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] gave Wil a wink. He just looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…&lt;em&gt;Are&lt;/em&gt; you coming to bail us out, Captain Rasea? Help us escape?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, that sounds like a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun. But no. We're robbing you. Mind handing over the Swords of Serept?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She winked at Wil. Then she did a double-take.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, did you recruit an undead sand-person onto your ship?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep looked offended. Wil just stared at Captain Rasea. He felt…let down. Not so much by the impending doom and the three vast navies as…her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Rasea, you promised me you'd let our ship go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had &lt;em&gt;promised.&lt;/em&gt; And somehow, in this moment, this singular broken vow stung most of all. The [Pirate Captain]'s eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—obviously, I lied. I just thought you wouldn't give up the treasure beforehand. I was right to wait. The Treant proved that. But I didn't &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt;, lie. I gave you my oath."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you still broke it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Not exactly.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] smiled. Lord Seagrass was pursuing from behind. The Drowned Crews were advancing, chanting. The [Pirates] were roaring as they came on. But Rasea just smiled. She stared at the sky as Wil looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here's a lesson from the sea, Lord Kallinad. You can trust a [Pirate] like me—but only her words. I swore by the Flag of Savere that you'd not be troubled by us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed at her mast. Everyone looked up. The flag hung beneath her colors. Wil nodded slowly. And Captain Rasea swept her hat from her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So. Lads? &lt;em&gt;Burn the flag.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her crew pointed up. Wands and arrows. The Centaur fired two shots. Wil saw the flag explode into flames. He stared at Rasea. She laughed as she put the hat back onto her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But that's &lt;em&gt;Savere's &lt;/em&gt;flag."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It burned in the scrying orb as Noass commentated fast as he ever had and Seborn stared at the sight. And Niers Astoragon watched his beloved pupils. Captain Rasea laughed without a care in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So? I only put it up because my sister gets prickly if I don't! I care nothing for nations! For rules! For laws or armies!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stood on her ship as it turned towards &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Captain Rasea Zecrew bowed. And her eyes shone with the purest light of adventure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Insanity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"After all, I'm a &lt;em&gt;[Pirate].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then she grabbed the rope as the boom swung by her head. She soared through the air. And landed on the deck of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Captain Lasc drew his sword and Rasea leapt at him. They locked blades as the other fleets shot through the waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The final battle for the Swords of Serept began.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Final Battle. A [Storm Captain]'s Skill. A Choice is Made.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;War at sea. That was the only word for it. Three navies were clashing in the ocean. The first, a massive trading fleet and armada led by the [Stormlord Captain], one of the five most powerful [Lords] in the world. The 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most famous…according to landfolk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Admiral Seagrass. He stood on the deck of the largest ship in the fleet. Smiling like steel. His trimmed beard, his precise, almost flamboyant but also military dress and his words all added to his appearance. Each syllable was clipped and clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had been both lawbreaker and the law itself on the seas. Now, his fleets that brought goods from continent to continent ruled the seas. He spoke as his [Storm Captains] angled, loosing spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"An odd detour from our trading route. The cargo had better be worth the cost. Get me those blades. Send the eastern fleet to stop those [Pirates]. The rest—down the Undersea Crews! Encircle &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Over a hundred ships sailed forwards, crewed by [Storm Sailors]. The [Pirates] turned their ships, swearing as they saw one of the powers of the sea headed at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the Undersea Crews came on. Captain Therrium was leading the charge. They were aiming at &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;, which was locked in battle with the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt;. And a single warship from the House of Minos stood in the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The battle looked like a…dance from above. The watchers through the scrying orbs, from Niers Astoragon to the King of Destruction and Archmage Nailihuaile and the rest saw the ships meeting, clashing, and separating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They did not form an untidy scrum like some landfolk battle. Too many ships locked together meant that if one sank, it would pull the others down as masts and rigging entangled. And fire would spread. So the ships formed smaller knots of combat, boarding each other, separating—leaving vessels to drift into the ocean depths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some of the Drowned Vessels did it on purpose. They rose, smashing into Storm Ships from below. The [Storm Captains] hurled magic from their decks; the [Pirates] attacked with every trick, from improvised firebombs to swinging across the gaps to light parts of the other ships on fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chaos and confusion. &lt;/em&gt;And at the heart of it—Wil Kallinad and his friends. He saw Captain Lasc moving backwards across the deck, dueling Captain Rasea Zecrew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Shining. Her entire body was lit up by the light and it was blinding the [Storm Captain]. But he refused to flee. He stepped backwards, his sword slashing at hers. And his left hand moved like lightning, punching, deflecting her sword. He struck her twice, but the [Pirate Captain] moved back each time. And she was laughing as she cut him deep across the leg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;To arms!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz roared. The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary's&lt;/em&gt; crew were joining their [Captain]. Or trying to—Delivan had the helm. He roared at Venaz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Help Captain Lasc! We won't survive if the Illuminary boards! They'll cut us to ribbons!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah! Three at once? A fine battle!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea whirled as Venaz charged her from the left. She slashed and the Minotaur halted. She &lt;em&gt;ducked&lt;/em&gt; as Peki kicked at her head; she was too fast! And her body lit up in a flash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Anglerfish woman darted forwards as the others were blinded. She stabbed Peki in the arm and the Garuda recoiled. Rasea kicked her across the deck, blocked a slash from Lasc—and turned to confront Merrik. The Dwarf charged in, and her blade cut into his armor. But he forced her back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Wil, get back! She's too high-level!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola shouted. Feshi was trying to aim into the melee, but Rasea was now fighting four-on-one. And pushing all four back. Wil looked around desperately. The [Pirate Captain] was the least of their worries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Drowned Ships incoming!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky pointed ahead. The Undersea Crews were streaming forwards. Wil saw Therrium pointing at him. The Blowfish [Archer] was aiming her bow. And two ships were in the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary &lt;/em&gt;and Prince Khedal's warship from the House of Minos. A portion of the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary's&lt;/em&gt; crew swung onto the nearest Drowned Ship, stalling them, fighting against the larger crew fearlessly. And Prince Khedal stood on the sides of his ship as his Minotaurs fired their siege weapons constantly, focusing on single ships before moving to the next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So. This is the product of greed. Minotaurs. For a son of the House of Minos. For honor. We do battle. Nothing less. &lt;em&gt;To me.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur Prince looked around. A group of Minotaur [Sailors] stood at his back. They were armed with long-handled axes. Armor. Khedal stared at the dozens of ships headed for him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Give no ground. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; must escape. You—join the Humans. The rest of you—board and sink these trespassers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A group of Minotaurs rushed towards &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; They dove into the waters and swam towards the other boat. Prince Khedal locked eyes with Captain Therrium. He pointed as the first ship crashed into his warship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;For the House of Minos! Charge!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He leapt off his deck and onto &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow.&lt;/em&gt; Drowned Sailors stared up at the Minotaur as he drew two large axes from his back. Captain Therrium looked around. Prince Khedal had landed on his ship alone as the Minotaurs fought the other Drowned Crews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Are you mad, Minotaur?&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Surrender now and I will spare your ship."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur looked around. Therrium's crew laughed. Prince Khedal's eyes narrowed. They were green-and-yellow. Not red, as Venaz's were, or the other Minotaurs fighting into a rage. They were hacking through the Drowned Folk. But Khedal just waited, axes in hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned his head. The Blowfish [Archer] loosed an arrow tipped with the deadly toxin. The Minotaur leaned out of the way. The arrow missed. The old prince turned. He saw a [Depth Sailor] leaping at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He hacked the Drowned Woman apart with one of his axes. Turned. Gracefully, he cut two [Sailors] in half with his other axe. He brought the other axe back, cleaving through a [Depth Sailor]'s guard. The Minotaur walked forwards, ignoring the blows to his armor. He began cutting down Therrium's crew one by one, his blades leaving a trail of red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium stopped smiling. He snarled as the Minotaur's blades flashed. One minute, then two—the crew assaulted him from all sides. But all that happened was that they died. Khedal had no helmet, but he kept turning his head, avoiding arrows and spells. And the rest of his body was too armored. And he was cutting apart dozens of the crew, headed straight for Captain Therrium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take us down! Drown that damned Minotaur&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Depth Captain] ordered. He drew his sword and clashed with Khedal. The first blow from the Minotaur threw him back across the deck. Therrium's body surged with electricity. He slashed, connecting with Khedal's side as the Minotaur turned, hacking apart another [Depth Sailor].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The deadly charge of electricity made all of Khedal's hair stand on end. And nothing else. He turned and Therrium leapt back before an axe could end him. The Drowned Crew backed up as the Minotaur turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Worthless. You are all without honor, much less &lt;em&gt;skill at arms.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He glared about. And blocked an arrow to the back of his head from the [Venom Archer] with the flat of his axe. Therrium stared uncertainly. But then he felt his ship &lt;em&gt;sinking&lt;/em&gt; into the waves. He grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Diving! Depth shields aren't down! Brace!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Helmswoman] bellowed. Khedal looked around as the Drowned Crews grabbed ahold of parts of the ship. The ship was &lt;em&gt;diving&lt;/em&gt; into the waters, and without the magical bubble that kept oxygen and atmosphere on the ship. Waters engulfed him as Therrium felt his other, eel-half breathing in the water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He grinned. The Minotaur was stranded on his boat. Khedal was suddenly &lt;em&gt;underwater&lt;/em&gt; as the Drowned Crews slowly moved through the water around him. They swam at him, as the Minotaur looked around. Blinded. Slowed. Unable to &lt;em&gt;breathe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Folk closed.&lt;em&gt; Hand-to-hand&lt;/em&gt; underwater; no arrows and fewer spells would work. They swam towards him. And the Minotaur Prince? His eyes slowly turned &lt;em&gt;red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Blood turned the waters crimson where &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; had sunk. After three minutes, a form surfaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Prince Khedal. His head broke the waves and he inhaled. He looked around—saw another ship passing by. The Minotaur swam towards it with one arm. He drove the axe he was carrying in his other hand into the side of the ship—and then drew the other one. He began to climb onto the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Blood and water ran from his armor as the Drowned Crews saw the Minotaur coming over the side. Khedal's eyes were red with rage. But he was calming down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Worthless tricks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pulled himself over the railing and stood up. The [Depth Captain] drew her sword. Khedal threw one of his axes through her head and strode forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Behind him, &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; surfaced. The waters were still red with blood. Therrium gazed at the body parts of his crew that ran across the deck. He looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Keep away from that Minotaur.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Get me those damn swords!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Boarding from the port! [Storm Sailors]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The battle on board &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was a wild melee. Wil saw figures fighting around all sides of the ship. The students and Captain Lasc and his crew had formed a desperate circle around the chest. And their ship was being assaulted from all sides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;By order of Admiral Seagrass, surrender!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Storm Captain] strode over the decks. His [Storm Sailors] charged a group of Drowned Folk who snarled—another Octopus-type spat ink into the faces of the [Storm Sailors] before a crossbow bolt took her down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky was standing next to Wil, aiming Delivan's crossbow; the [First Mate] was desperately trying to steer the ship out of danger. Merrik and Peki were defending the Helm. But the ships kept &lt;em&gt;coming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can't get away. Wil—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola was shouting as she thrust back a pair of [Storm Sailors]. They stabbed her—the Selphid buried her hatchet in one head, ignoring the blades in her chest. Wil pointed his wand, blew the other [Sailor] off her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a hopeless battle. All he could think was that they had to abandon the chest. But even that was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Difficult&lt;/em&gt;. There was nowhere to run and the chest itself was being guarded. Fetohep stood in front of it, calmly looking around. An enemy [Storm Sailor] stumbled through Captain Lasc's defenders. He looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Thief.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead [King] swung a blade made of sand. Sand—but it cut through the [Storm Sailor]'s face. Fetohep calmly blocked two more [Depth Sailors] slashing at him. The ruler of Khelt turned, and his blade cut both down, finding holes in their guard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was a &lt;em&gt;[Warrior]. &lt;/em&gt;And a good one! Even the other high-level [Warriors] were avoiding him. And—Fetohep looked &lt;em&gt;amused&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In this battle, there was no amusement in Wil's heart. Just thundering adrenaline. But Fetohep wasn't the only one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hail to Lord Seagrass!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A form swung across the air. The [Storm Captain] cutting towards Lasc turned. Just in time for Rasea to shear the top of his head off. The [Storm Sailors] cried out as Rasea the Shining landed among them with four members of her crew. They diced the invaders in a blur. Then they pointed at Wil's group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh dead gods. Here they come—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra turned. She charged one of the four [Pirates]. Captain Lasc punched at another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll take that one! Inky—the other! Wil, Feshi, cover us!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz cut with his battleaxe at the Drake with a cutlass. Wil aimed his wand as Feshi shot an arrow. The four [Pirates] slid across the deck. One was dueling &lt;em&gt;Lasc&lt;/em&gt;—another cut Yerra straight down her body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ah! Dead gods! They got my inner body!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid shouted. She &lt;em&gt;kicked&lt;/em&gt; and the Gnoll went flying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Rampaging!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She roared as she charged forwards. Captain Rasea was laughing. She was dueling Fetohep himself. The [King]'s eyes flashed as he parried her enchanted blade, but his hardened sand-sword was breaking with each clash. Rasea speared him through the chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well done, mortal. Your name?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rasea Zecrew. Your &lt;em&gt;Majesty.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She swept him a bow. Then beheaded the apparition. The sand-Fetohep collapsed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea reached for one of the Swords of Serept. A glowing, blue blade. Then she flicked her hand up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep's reaching hand missed hers by an inch. Rasea winked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thought so. What a pain—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ruler of Khelt rose out of the ground again. He had reshaped himself out of the magical sand. Rasea grinned. She saluted him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Back up, lads! We need a full crew to grab that damn box!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her four [Pirates] and Rasea leapt backwards as more [Storm Sailors] flanked them from the left at Wil's direction. None of them had fallen—and Venaz was bleeding. He cursed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're &lt;em&gt;high-level. &lt;/em&gt;We can't hold them off!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Crew of the &lt;/em&gt;Illuminary&lt;em&gt;. On me.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Rasea stood at the railing. And Wil saw sixteen more shapes swinging onto the deck. His heart sank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Step aside, Lord Kallinad and you lot. Be a shame to cut your adventure short today."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea's eyes glinted. Wil raised his sword and wand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Rasea—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thwoom.&lt;/em&gt; The ship shook. Wil and the [Pirates] whirled. &lt;em&gt;Three&lt;/em&gt; Storm Ships had docked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;For Lord Seagrass!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hundreds of [Sailors] poured over the railings. Rasea grimaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, well. Merchant Seagrass brought his trading fleet. Back up!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another impact. Two Drowned Vessels. Therrium strode onto the deck, eyes blazing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Get. Me. Those. Swords!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Crews and [Sailors] hit each other in a melee. Rasea looked towards Wil and Captain Lasc's crew, a shrinking knot in the center of the fighting. She eyed Fetohep, defending his treasure. Her eyes…slowly passed over the diamond swords.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Cap'n? Are we going in?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Oldblood Drake hacked apart a Drowned Woman. Rasea looked at her crew. A Centaur with a pair of crossbows calmly shot two [Sailors]. The Illuminary's crew was waiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Huh. You know, lads. I just had a thought."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirates] groaned and grinned. Captain Rasea eyed the diamond swords.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Back to the ship. Now!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They dove over the railings, taking themselves out of the fight. Rasea swam like a fish towards her ship; she grabbed the line and was flung onto the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain? Too hairy for you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll [Helmsman] laughed in disbelief. Rasea just grinned in reply. She pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take us out of the melee. Get me to the Bloodtear's ships. Over there!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were sinking two Drowned Vessels; giant holes had been taken out of the Drowned Vessels and the crews were swimming to other friendly ships. The Bloodtear Pirate group, eight ships in total was pulling back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seagrass' navy was on the advance. And the Undersea Crews and [Pirates] were &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; outnumbered by them. It was Prince Khedal and the Minotaurs who were taking on the ships on &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet's&lt;/em&gt; starboard side. They cut through the [Sailors]. And only Therrium and the other Drowned Folk were keeping the battle equal on &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Illuminary shot towards the Bloodtear Pirate's ship. They saw the famed [Pirate] ship coming and the Bloodtear Pirates began aiming spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hey! Hold!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Rasea bellowed. Her ballistae were aiming at the lead ship. But she hadn't fired. Yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Captain of the Bloodtear Pirates hesitated. He met the shining gaze of the woman and held up a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No one attack! Yet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea strode up the gangplank. She wasted no time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, Bloodtear's Lot. I had a thought. We're all going after that damn treasure. But the way it's looking, only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of us is going to get it. And there's a treasure worth more than even the Swords of Serept or whatever. Waiting to be claimed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A bigger treasure? Which is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear Captain looked incredulous. For an answer, Rasea pointed. The Bloodtear Crew turned their heads. And Rasea the Shining grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Seagrass' command ship floated in the middle of his navy. The Bloodtear Captain looked at Rasea. And her eyes blazed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Merchant Seagrass himself. Why are we wasting time on swords? You with me? If you are—spread the word."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Bloodtear Pirates looked at each other. And then they grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The navy of ships began turning. [Pirate] vessels and Drowned Ships broke away from &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Wil didn't know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; at first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nor did the others. Lord Seagrass turned his head, spotting the ships moving in concert. Thirty in total, Undersea Crews, [Pirates]—but they weren't fighting each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What are they doing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes narrowed. But then he saw. The ships were turning. Coming his way. The [Stormlord] saw a glowing ship leading the charge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Admiral Seagrass! The Illuminary is coming about!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Send forward all ships!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Stormlord Captain] bellowed. But the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; was shooting across the waters. It surged past a group of Storm Ships. And Rasea was standing at the helm of her ship. Her eyes shone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lads, today we topple the tyrant of the seas. &lt;em&gt;Merchant Seagrass, I've been waiting to meet you! With me!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grabbed hold of the rope. The boom &lt;em&gt;snapped&lt;/em&gt;. And Rasea flew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's &lt;em&gt;insane.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the Bloodtear Pirates remarked. The others nodded as they saw Rasea let go of the rope and fly through the air with her crew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Eight landed on the deck, scattering [Storm Sailors]. Lord Seagrass stared as Rasea the Shining pulled her hat out of her bag of holding. His warship was the largest ship on the sea bar none. Hundreds of [Storm Sailors] for each of the [Pirates]. But more [Pirate] and Drowned Ships were sailing on his ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rasea Zecrew. Today's the last time you haunt my trading lines."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Stormlord Captain] slowly drew a sword with a green-grey blade. The [Pirate Captain] drew her shining blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Merchant Seagrass. If you've the guts—come and take my head! I'll wear your &lt;em&gt;hat. &lt;/em&gt;Boys—get ready. Strobe pattern."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The glowing Anglerfish side of her body began to light up, flashing bright, disconcerting patterns of light, blinding everyone but her crew who kept their backs to their [Captain]. They advanced, fighting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The knot of Lasc's crew was shrinking. Inky was lying against the chest. Someone had cut off part of her tentacle-leg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It'll grow back—just—just—watch your backs!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailor] cocked the crossbow and shot. Venaz whirled. He brought his axe down and cleaved open a head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're lost. We have to retreat. Take another vessel. Wil, what's our plan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We go with the [Storm Sailors]. Or we fight with Prince Khedal. Either way—we abandon the treasure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil looked at King Fetohep. The [King] stood next to the shining swords. He looked at Wil Kallinad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad. We can still make it out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc was clutching at his side. He looked at Wil, wide-eyed with battle's fury. Wil stared at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;How?&lt;/em&gt; There are too many ships! &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; can't outrun them, let alone—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We won't have to. Lord Kallinad. By your order, I'll use my Skill. A [Storm Captain]'s first and last Skill. It's an act of desperation. It could sink us &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. But if you want to fight—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He bared his teeth. Wil looked at his friends. A [Storm Captain]'s…? Inky looked alarmed. But all eyes fell on Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's your choice. If there's a chance—I say take it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz lifted his crimson axe. Feshi hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil—there's such a thing as a battle you don't have to win at any cost. The Professor taught us that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola glanced at the swords. She saw Peki kicking people off the command deck, Merrik smashing an enemy [Captain]'s foot into the deck. The Selphid turned to Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't want you to die, Wil. But whatever you decide—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] closed his eyes. He didn't know. Too many lives were in his hands. But so much blood had been shed already, for this treasure. He looked to the figure standing there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"King Fetohep. What would &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;say? Is your treasure worth all this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured around at the fighting groups, almost ignoring the treasure as they tore each other apart. And the ruler of Khelt—smiled. He spoke, as Wil saw the Undersea Crews pushing back the [Storm Sailors]. The Storm Ships were retreating; covering Admiral Seagrass whose ship was under attack from all sides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Show me your resolve, son of House Kallinad. Or do you think my blades are so easily won? Risk everything for them. Or leave them and I will take my treasure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He flicked his sand-sword up. And Wil saw his flaming eyes glinting in amusement. The [Lord] felt a chill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He knew this would happen. &lt;/em&gt;He had known from the beginning. This—was this all the undead [King]'s amusement? Or—Wil's eyes snapped open. And he thought of the Professor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Was it a test? He met Fetohep's gaze. And turned his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Lasc? Use your Skill. Everyone—this is it. King Fetohep? I hope these blades are worth it. &lt;em&gt;On me! &lt;/em&gt;[Stoneskin Formation]. We have three minutes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crew spread out around the chest. Their skin deflected blades—for three minutes. Captain Lasc closed his eyes and raised his hand to the sky. Wil didn't hear what he said. He turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A single force was advancing along the deck. Drowned Folk. And at their head—Captain Therrium. Prince Khedal's warship was engulfed on all sides; there was no one coming to help. The Drowned Man looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Lord Kallinad. My crews have paid a heavy toll. There's no second chance. 'Twould have been better if you'd given over the blades to begin with.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Therrium. We're the Titan's students. We &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; our second chances. If you want to lose more—come and get them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil felt relaxed. Venaz grinned as he hefted his axe. The [Depth Captain] sighed. He raised his sword. And glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clouds were racing over the skies.&lt;/em&gt; He looked at Captain Lasc as the [Storm Captain] sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;You fool. Summon as many storms as you like. We'll be done with this ship and it will be sunk before it arrives.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps. But if you take too long, this [Storm Captain] will brave it. Come on, Drowned Man. Take my treasure off my ship. I dare you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc strode forwards. Wil edged to the side. It was &lt;em&gt;time.&lt;/em&gt; He saw Fetohep smiling. He just needed—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A distraction.&lt;/em&gt; Captain Lasc and Therrium were striding towards each other as Merrik and Peki jumped over the deck. The Drowned Crew outnumbered the waning [Storm Sailors]. And a shadow fell over…all of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Water hit the decks. The Undersea Crews, Captain Lasc's [Sailors]—and the students gazed up as&lt;em&gt; something &lt;/em&gt;made a sound. A hissing roar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A wall of flesh and scales. A serpent's head. Gigantic. The Sea Serpent rose, as high as the masts. And standing on top of it was a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; angry man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This investment has cost me. But I will have those swords. Now."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Admiral Seagrass landed on the decks. Therrium and Lasc looked at each other. They turned to face the [Stormlord Captain]. A &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; Sea Serpent and a Nelgaunt's head rose out of the surf. The sea monsters regarded the deck full of—food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He owns &lt;em&gt;sea serpents?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola whispered. Captain Therrium bared his teeth. In the distance—Lord Seagrass' warship was on fire. But the Admiral was on deck. He glanced up at the sky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some idiot summoned a &lt;em&gt;storm? &lt;/em&gt;Surrender. All of you. And I'll let you live."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Sea Serpent &lt;em&gt;hissed&lt;/em&gt;. Captain Lasc and Therrium gave each other another look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;I take no orders from landmen.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And I don't sail under your command."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So be it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Seagrass drew his blade. The two [Captains] leapt forwards. The Sea Serpents hit the decks, biting [Sailors] in half, but the Drowned Folk were already leaping for the railings. They attacked the gigantic monsters from the water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Kill them! Take the swords!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium bellowed. Seagrass pointed as he deflected the two swords in a duel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Pride of the Waves]. &lt;em&gt;Get me my blades.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailors] pushed back, suddenly fighting twice as viciously. Both sides hit Lasc's crew and the students. They fought, desperately. And—fell back. Back, towards the mast, the treasure chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was it. Wil saw the waves of enemies incoming. He looked at Fetohep. And he could have sworn he saw the undead king's left eye flash at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Choose, Lord Kallinad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil nodded. He closed his eyes. And then he reached down and picked something up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky's head turned as she reloaded Delivan's crossbow. She saw the [Lord] holding a transparent blade that glittered in the fading light as rain began to fall. A magical sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A relic. Wil held the Diamond Sword of Serept aloft. The fighting crews looked at him. And Wil understood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Blades are meant to be used."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep nodded, pleased. Wil took a breath. He felt the blade humming in his hands. He saw Admiral Seagrass turning as Lasc staggered backwards, cut. The&lt;em&gt; Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; was sailing at his ship and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rain was falling. The waves were growing choppy as heavy winds began blowing. A storm was coming. And Wil held the blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Green diamond. A greatsword. Yet it was &lt;em&gt;light&lt;/em&gt;. He marveled at the power rushing through his hands. And then—Wil turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Venaz.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He tossed the sword. Every head turned. The Minotaur whirled. He dropped his axe, saw the sword curving towards him. And he grabbed the hilt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Stunned, the Minotaur looked at the [Lord]. Then his eyes focused on the blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;He has the damn sword! Get it!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Depth Pirate] shouted. She lunged. Venaz whirled. And his form &lt;em&gt;blurred.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [War Strategist] turned. And the greatsword whirled through the air. &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt;. As if he were under a [Haste] spell. He slashed—a Bloodtear Pirate looked down at her sundered blade and the deep cut in her chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur brought the blade down. So fast Wil didn't even see the arc. The greatsword cleaved through armor and blades. The Minotaur slashed left and right—the [Depth Sailors] and [Storm Sailors] fell back, crying out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Windblade of Serpisel."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep of Khelt smiled. Venaz swung the sword and cleared the deck around him. Wil heard a bellow in the distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Prince Khedal was raising his axes. Roaring in delight and surprise. The Minotaur crews bellowed as Venaz held up the blade. And the enemy crews fell back in disarray.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All but Lord Seagrass. His eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stop that [Lord]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed a finger. Crossbows &lt;em&gt;snapped, &lt;/em&gt;but Fetohep calmly cut the bolts down as Wil ducked behind the chest. And he was reaching for another sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The second blade was clear diamond. It had an odd hilt, with three reflective leaves. Wil rose with it as a [Storm Sailor] charged him. He raised the sword and the man stumbled back. Wil slashed—but the blade didn't speed him up. The [Storm Sailor] ducked left, grinning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. He lanced out and caught Wil in the shoulder. The enchanted leather peeled away as the [Storm Sailor] cut Wil shallowly. The [Lord] cried out. His friends were engaged, even Venaz. He saw the Minotaur turn and blur towards him. But the [Storm Sailor] was right there. He raised his blade as Fetohep watched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Wil stabbed him through the side. The [Storm Sailor] turned. He looked at Wil. And then—down at Wil, trying to shield himself with the sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;glowing&lt;/em&gt; sword. And a third Wil Kallinad raised his sword. He thrust—the [Storm Sailor] staggered back. He looked at the three Terandrian [Lords]. Down at the two holes in his body. They weren't…illusions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not fair."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He murmured and collapsed. Wil Kallinad, shaking, saw another Wil staring wide-eyed at him. And on his right—another Wil. All three looked at each other; mirrored perfectly but for the cut on one of the Wil's shoulders. Then they turned to Fetohep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Threefold Mirrorblade. A pity. I would have given that to young Atwood."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ruler of Khelt looked highly amused. Wil saw the crew charging forwards, trying to get to the chest. Through &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; pairs of eyes. All at once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The image should have unsettled him. But—he heard sounds, tripled. And &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; minds could process it. The other two Wils looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take the left side. I'll take the right."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One Wil spoke. The other fake-Wil nodded. He raised a hand, concentrated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't use any Skills. But I can see—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Think—wait. My gear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All three pulled out a magical wand and stared at it. Then—all three aimed. Three enemy [Depth Sailors] went tumbling down with holes in their chests. Astonished, the [Lords] looked at Fetohep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lesser artifacts."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [King] looked pleased at their expressions. Two Wils plunged forwards, into the fighting. Yerranola stared at a second Wil who cleaved into a [Storm Sailor]'s shoulder. He &lt;em&gt;ducked&lt;/em&gt; a blade—the other Wil had seen it coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Depth Sailor] planted a sword in Wil's stomach. All three [Lords] cried out. But the illusory-Wil just blinked. Then he stabbed the woman in &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; chest. Yerranola looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Didn't hurt. Is that how it feels, Yerra?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid's mouth dropped open. The fake-Wil grinned. And advanced, fearless. The tide was turning as Venaz whirled, fast, putting his entire weight behind the swings of his enchanted blade. He was pressing Lord Seagrass back; the [Stormlord] was wary of the enchanted blade, and Venaz' reach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tulm the Mithril stared into the scrying orb. He turned to Xol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I want that one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I as well. If desire were deed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The War Walker nodded slowly. He didn't take his eyes off the battle reflected in the scrying orb. And even Tulm the Mithril was gazing at the blade Wil held.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Envious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relics.&lt;/em&gt; Everyone was fighting twice as hard to get to the blades. But Venaz, the two illusory Wils—and the final blade. The entire world watched as Lord Kallinad reached into the chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The last blade. Wil stared at them. There was a red scimitar, a yellow single-sided blade, the black dagger, a blue—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Which one?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep was watching as the other two Wils fought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Just pick a damn color!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik roared. Wil looked around. Venaz stumbled backwards—Lord Seagrass had nicked him with his blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Idiot. You don't deserve that sword."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He reached for the greatsword as Venaz swore; he had grown pale as Seagrass' enchanted sword had cut him. The Minotaur rolled as a Wil charged forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Seagr—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] beheaded the artificial Wil. The real Wil recoiled; and he saw one of the leaves grow dark as his clone vanished. Did it have to recharge? But Venaz was running back and Admiral Seagrass was staring at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Give me the third blade, boy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throw it here and my crew will give you passage!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium ordered. One of the Sea Serpents was screaming as Drowned Sailors clung to it. It dove, escaping the fighting. Wil reached into the chest, fumbling, as both [Captains] approached. He saw a flash of light off the portside bow. But one of the swords rose in his hand. He turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yerranola, catch!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He threw the black dagger—it had been chance that guided his hand. Yerranola whirled. Her eyes went round.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me? But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The dagger clattered onto the deck. The Selphid had missed. She ran at it as everyone shouted. She dove—and a foot kicked her away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aha! &lt;em&gt;Mine!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Rasea Zecrew crowed. She grinned; she'd swung off her ship &lt;em&gt;again!&lt;/em&gt; She reached down—and a fake Wil tackled her. The [Pirate Captain] cursed. She stabbed Wil through the chest multiple times and he vanished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get the sword!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky dove for the blade. A dozen hands yanked her off. Wil saw the blade skittering across the deck, slicing a few feet—where was it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone grabbed the blade. And held it aloft. The fighting deck stared at the black dagger, held aloft. And at the furry paw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi met Wil's eyes with her wide, brown ones. The black dagger &lt;em&gt;flashed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. That would be the Sarcophagus Dagger of—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A figure rose out of the decks. No—it stepped out of Feshi's shadow. Out of the blade &lt;em&gt;itself.&lt;/em&gt; Wil saw glowing eyes. A skeletal figure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In fact—a skeleton. Wearing faded armor. The figure was dressed like some ancient warrior of old. And it—no—she—spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Protect Khelt's chosen.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She held a glaive. And she swung it around. Two of Seagrass' [Storm Sailors] fell down, screaming as the frozen blade cut them, turning their skin black with frostbite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A second shadow stepped out of the blade. This time a skeletal [Archer].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Serve eternal.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It loosed an arrow through a Drowned Man's chest and into another figure standing behind him. Feshi stared around, terrified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ancient Kheltian protectors. The Sarcophagus Dagger of Devi. A good tool for a [Strategist]. Let the champions of Khelt fight. They will rise eternal. Now, we have made our bargain. Return the rest of my blades, Wil Kallinad. And you and your comrades shall possess these blades until you die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep's eyes glittered. Feshi looked around, horrified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I do not want this. &lt;em&gt;Necromancy—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll staggered back from the undead, staring at them. But more were rising. Fighting. And Lord Seagrass pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Claim the chest!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He advanced on Feshi as the undead servants of Khelt formed a wall. They were good—but the admiral was hacking them apart. Their shadows returned to the dagger as Feshi fled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Protect the chest!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The last remaining Wil ordered. The real Wil stood. And his friends placed themselves in a circle around the box. Merrik grumbled at Fetohep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mind loaning me a blade?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. They have been given to their owners. Fate has chosen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The storm was whipping the deck. Sailors slid back and forth as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; began to rock. Therrium was cursing. He looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;You could have been saved.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Indeed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seagrass from one side, Therrium from the other. Lasc blocked Therrium. And Rasea slid forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can't get away, Seagrass!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Damn you, you idiot!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The admiral cursed as Rasea leapt at him. Wil looked left and right. He saw ships being blown by the storm. It was getting worse and worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's time! &lt;em&gt;Delivan! Take us into the storm!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate], unnoticed at the helm, spun the wheel. The boom moved—&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; ducked. Peki and Merrik charged left as Therrium backed up. Venaz was hacking at the Drowned Crew and they were afraid of the Minotaur with the enchanted blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Feshi's undead. The Gnoll, looking terrified, but resolute, pointed the dagger and Khelt's elite undead charged, forcing the Drowned Crews back. But that left—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra, and Wil. Rasea was battling Admiral Seagrass, but he was pressing her back. He tore left as Wil and Yerranola attacked the remaining enemy [Storm Sailors]. The last Wil went down as they hacked him apart. But the real Wil was unharmed but for a few cuts. And his Mirrorblade could still cleave flesh and metal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Push them off the decks! We can do this!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil raised his sword. He saw the Drowned Crews falling back in disarray. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was sailing into an oblivion of rain. It hammered the decks. And the storm was blowing the ship forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Admiral! We can't stay in the storm! We have to—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Storm Sailor] broke off as Seagrass snarled. He slashed at Rasea and she staggered as the energy-sapping blade cut her. He looked at Yerranola and Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sword or not, you can't defeat me. Give up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He warned the Selphid and Wil. The two [Strategists] looked at each other. They glanced at Fetohep. The [King] waved a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have given you enough aid."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damn.&lt;/em&gt; Wil saw Seagrass advancing. He saw a Sea Serpent rising behind the [Stormlord Captain]. Seagrass gestured. The Sea Serpent reared back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And a shape exploded out of the depths. It &lt;em&gt;yanked&lt;/em&gt; the Sea Serpent down. The surprised monster screamed once. As something &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; ate it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Seagrass paused. He was still pointing. He turned his head. Wil froze. He saw the waves move. And in the distance—one of the Storm Ships making for &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; exploded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A shape burst out of the waves. It &lt;em&gt;snapped&lt;/em&gt; the frigate in half. Wil saw the entire ship crash into the waves. And he saw the waters break as another ship disappeared. It was—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The &lt;em&gt;Kraken?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola whispered. No. It was—a &lt;em&gt;whale. &lt;/em&gt;Wil saw a gigantic head. And—&lt;em&gt;teeth.&lt;/em&gt; The Tearwhale surfaced, and &lt;em&gt;snapped &lt;/em&gt;a [Pirate] boat in half.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Tearwhale pod! They're in a feeding frenzy!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Storm Captain] turned his ship. Captain Rasea leapt to her feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Evasive! Damn! &lt;em&gt;Stop attacking my ship!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Damn them! Damn you all! Back to the ship! &lt;em&gt;Dive! Get out of range!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium howled. His crew flooded back to his ship. Captain Seagrass stared at the frenzy in the waters as the whale tore apart one of his pet Sea Serpents. A massive shape surfaced and Wil saw a frenzied eye. Biting jaws—he shielded his face as the Tearwhale crashed back into the sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get out of here!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even Rasea was running for her ship as a whale hit it from below. But Admiral Seagrass? He turned back, blade poised. And a figure charged him. He swung his sword. And beheaded Yerranola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yerra!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil shouted in horror. But the Selphid's body kept moving. She &lt;em&gt;tackled&lt;/em&gt; Seagrass. And he stared at the headless Selphid. Too late—he put the sword through her chest. But he missed &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; And she rushed him towards the railing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get lost!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Stormlord Captain] went over the railing. Yerranola raised her arms. Wil saw something orange peeking through her decapitated neck. She turned as the [Storm Sailors] looked after their leader and then dove over the sides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Selphids rule! Did you see that, Wil? I did it!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A tiny voice was coming from her inner body. Wil stared as the headless body held up a hand to high-five. He weakly slapped her hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did Yerra just throw Lord &lt;em&gt;Seagrass&lt;/em&gt; off the ship?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky was leaning on Venaz as the Minotaur dragged her over. Wil looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki was lying on the deck as Merrik flopped down. Feshi was backing up from the obedient undead who were following her. Delivan was leaning on the helm as Captain Lasc clutched at his side. [Storm Sailors] were looking around for the enemy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But there were none left. The storm engulfed the ships. And the Tearwhales—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil felt an &lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt; that threw him to the deck. All the ships were fleeing. And the predators of the deeps were &lt;em&gt;hungry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take us out of here! We're sailing into the storm!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc seized the wheel. Wil Kallinad saw Fetohep studying the whales. The ruler addressed Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If they eat the swords, I shall be displeased. But I have been entertained enough. Bring my swords at all haste, Wil Kallinad. You have proven you were worthy of wielding them. For now. Do not ever be less."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He vanished. The sand fell to the ground. Wil, disbelieving, looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sail into the heart of the storm! We're still being followed!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc overrode Delivan's objections. He pointed back. Wil saw two ships swirling, refusing to give up the chase as the whales battered them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;Illuminary &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;The Passing Shadow. Seagrass was lost to the waves, possibly dead, but probably not. The Storm Ships were in disarray. Even the [Pirates] and other Undersea Crews had had enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the other two ships? They were coming at &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Therrium had blood in his eyes. And Rasea was laughing as she dodged a whale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; sailed forwards, Wil saw a ship block the two coming at them. He saw a warship, a horned head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Prince Khedal had a deep cut down one cheek. And his armor was damaged around his side. His Minotaurs were wounded. Depleted in number. But the Prince looked at Wil. He clasped one fist to his chest as he looked at Venaz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We will buy you time. &lt;em&gt;Sail on,&lt;/em&gt; Lord Kallinad. And Venaz of Hammerad—you are the pride of the House of Minos. You must not die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He raised a hand as his ship intercepted both [Pirates]. Wil shouted after him. But Prince Khedal didn't look back. They disappeared as the rain shrouded the world. Venaz stared at the Prince of Minotaurs. And the sword he held. He started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Prince Khedal will not die. He is second only to our King. And I—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He held up the sword. Wonderingly, he looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You gave me the blade."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I guess I'm not trading it for favors. You can pay me back later."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil weakly grinned. Venaz looked at him, and then reached out and hugged Wil, one-armed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;pay you back. Somehow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I have it? It was meant for Yerra. I—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi had managed to make the undead go back into the dagger. She held it out. But Yerra stepped back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You got it first, Feshi. And you heard what Fetohep said. It might be cursed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students looked at each other. They might have said anything, or everything. They were alive, against all odds. And at that moment—Lasc shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;All hands on deck! Move! I need all hands!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students jerked. Inky was trying to move, with her severed tentacle-leg. She pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We don't have enough hands! We need your help! I'll show you what to do!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students saw her pointing. The sails were in danger with the rain coming down. There were holes in the hull. And only a few [Sailors] were left. Venaz raced forwards, using the speed-enchantment of his blade. Wil saw one of the mirrors on his blade recharging and a second Wil ran to help patch the holes. Feshi, grimacing, pointed her blade and one of the undead appeared and began to scale the masts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ship entered the storm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Ending. A Port, a Final Chase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was how the battle ended. Not with capture, the loss of the treasure. But a storm. The storm Lasc had called.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it was a terrible storm. A storm at sea; a [Storm Captain]'s first and last Skill of resort. Even in dire straits, they feared to use it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because the storm obeyed no one. And it could crack even a ship like &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; in a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil and the crew fought through the storm, securing the deck, patching holes in the hull. He watched his alter-self thrown off the deck and experienced the darkness of the sea until the fragment of him vanished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc bellowed orders. He was navigating the ship, somehow finding a course. The waves grew higher. Wil saw one rise over the ship; it would have destroyed the mast had the sail still been attached. It &lt;em&gt;smashed&lt;/em&gt; the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Storm Sailor] was blown over the sides. No one was able to find them in the surf. The students and most of the crew sheltered belowdecks as water ran below. They bailed, desperately, running up and taking cover from waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only Captain Lasc stayed at the helm, refusing to budge. The waves shook his ship. But the [Storm Captain] screamed defiance and sailed through wave after wave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil didn't know how much time passed. Hours. Then—days. The battering of the storm became background noise. He didn't know where they were—if they were nearing the edge of the storm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But they were still being chased&lt;/em&gt;. Twice, Wil saw the two ships. &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; surfaced and Lasc took them into the storm rather than fight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet, the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; was the more deadly foe. It broke through the waves, a beacon in the darkness. Wil saw Lasc turning his ship. It was hot on their tail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One last ploy. One bit of strategy. Wil saw Rasea, a glowing figure on her shining ship. He thought he heard her laugh as she shot after his ship. Captain Zecrew shot forwards as a massive wave engulfed &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. Wil shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Now!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc turned the ship. It stopped—the crew extinguished all the lights. Wil saw the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; shoot over a wave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea was at the helm of her ship, staring ahead. She was laughing as the wind whipped at her hat and clothing. She shot forwards, chasing &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; She never saw the hiding ship as the waves rolled up, obscuring everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hope I never meet her again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola had found a new body. She shuddered as the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; became a distant glow in the waters, surging forwards. Merrik stared after Rasea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, but I like her. Shame she keeps trying to kill us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They lost the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary.&lt;/em&gt; Therrium's ship? They saw and lost and saw it again. But the storm was their foe. Lasc traded places with Delivan, and then Inky, as they lashed themselves to the helm. And—slowly—they broke clear of the storm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rains lessened. The waves stopped throwing the boat. Wil didn't know when it happened. But one day he woke, and the heaving was gone. He stumbled up abovedecks and saw a blue sky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sky!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki was laughing and flying overhead. The crew cheered. Captain Lasc, panting, looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If any of you were [Sailors]—you'd be [Storm Sailors], Lord Kallinad. After that? After that battle?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We've all leveled. That's prize enough, Captain Lasc. What now?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil had the Mirrorblade sheathed at his side. Venaz had constructed a harness for it on his back for his greatsword; he only moved like a blur when he was holding it, though. A small flaw in a miraculous artifact. Even Feshi acknowledged the power of her sword. But she candidly feared what her clan would say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet—they were not done yet. Lasc looked around. And he calculated their position.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're in range of a port. We'll make for it at once. Fortune favors us. We're close to the exact spot you'd want us to be, Lord Kallinad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Where?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] smiled wearily. He pointed in the distance, and far, so far Wil could barely see it, something broke the horizon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Walled City of Zeres. Once we reach it—we'll be safe. The Drakes are as secure as The House of Minos."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Almost."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz had to be contrary. But the sails rose and &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; shot forwards. The wind was at their backs. Wil was staring as, in the distance, he saw &lt;em&gt;land&lt;/em&gt;. And a tall—city. It was curved around the mouth of the harbor, the walls massive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Walled City. Zeres, the City of Waves. And from there—my clan. Izril."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi murmured. Wil nodded. He had only been to First Landing. Izril. He inhaled, breathing in the salt air. Nearly done. The adventure was nearly—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; surfaced behind &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Every head turned. Merrik groaned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium stood at the prow. His face was thunderous. He pointed as his ship gave one final chase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drop everything. Drop the anchors. Drop the food! All we have to do is reach the harbor!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc roared. His ship sped ahead. But it was battered. And the Drowned Ship was—keeping pace. It was throwing spells as the two ships raced towards Zeres. Wil stood at the prow, looking back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the distance, the Walled City was waiting. Wil saw a distant fleet of ships moving in and out of the harbor. He looked backwards. Therrium was pacing up and down the deck. His ship was beginning to &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What if Peki throws an artificial Wil at Therrium? We can waste them. No offense, Wil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"None taken."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki tried. But even the fake Wils were heavy and a hail of attacks came up from the enemy ship and nearly blasted her out of the sky. Therrium pointed at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My swords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil looked back. His friends lined up near the railing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Time for one final clash. Wish I had one of those swords. But my hammer will do good enough. Let's show this Drowned Man what the Titan's students can do!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik roared. Peki landed next to him. Venaz drew his blade and his eyes gleamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We won our treasure. And I have a debt to pay."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"None of you die now!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola warned the others. Feshi sighed as she summoned more of Khelt's warriors. The two ships began to close. And Wil saw a flash in the distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zeres' towers lit up. And the Walled City shot something into the distance. Captain Therrium looked up with the others. He ran for the helm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A ball of magic hit the water next to his ship. It &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; like Lasc's [Depth Explosion] but twice as big. The Drowned Ship rocked. Wil saw a bolt of lightning arc through the sky and hit the sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Zeres is attacking! Look! The navy's coming! They know it's us!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was dancing and shouting; Drake ships were storming out of the bay. Wil saw distant crews of Drakes rowing against the wind. Magnificent Drake warships as their Walled City launched more spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damn you landfolk! Damn your Drakes! Damn your Walled Cities!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium was shaking with rage. He saw the Drake armada coming at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Captain. We can't fight that.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His [First Mate] was regrowing her lost limbs. The [Depth Captain] stared in despair at the distant ship. His was still pursuing. But—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was over. Wil and the others were laughing. Cheering the Drakes. Yerra was yanking at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come on! Get below! Let's get down before that Therrium launches a spell at our rears! It'd be like him!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Depth Captain] was fuming. He saw Wil laughing, Merrik hugging Peki, and Feshi—Venaz raising his greatsword over his head. He bowed his own head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;We've lost the treasure. All of it&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His crew looked at him. The Depth Captain turned. He'd never hear the end of it. But—he had one last thing. No victory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Just vengeance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Glisal&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Aim for that [Lord]. Kill him.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spoke to the half-Blowfish [Venom Archer]. She looked at Therrium's face. Silently, she spat the deadly venom onto one arrow. She sighted. &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; pursued for a second longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A bowstring twanged. Therrium turned the ship. It sank under the waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A single arrow flew, curving through the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We did it. What do we &lt;em&gt;do?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Go to Feshi's clan? Deliver the swords? We have to get to Chandrar! We promised Fetohep, didn't we? Dead gods! Another sea adventure? Can we hire a Courier to deliver the swords?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's just get to harbor. We'll sort the rest out later. I hope House Kallinad can pay Lasc for his ship!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students were celebrating. Merrik kept slapping Wil—and since he was short, some of the slaps were more on the lower back and buttocks. But everyone was laughing. Venaz was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This—I have to repay you, Wil. The swords are bound to us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured to the greatsword. Feshi stared at hers. Peki eyed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can I fight the undead?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know. I mean—yes, Peki. But I don't know. The undead? My people &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the undead. Ever since the Necromancer slew the Great Chieftain, Kerash…it may be trouble, no?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll deal with it, Feshi. Maybe Fetohep will allow us to trade blades? Let's just—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The arrow fell. Curving with the power of a Skill, towards Wil's back. Yerranola laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I just wish &lt;em&gt;I'd&lt;/em&gt; picked up the blade. I just never thought—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked up. Saw the flicker in the sky. Without a word, Yerranola shoved Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He hit the deck hard. He saw her shielding him, arms outstretched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Yerra, why did—?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz blinked. He saw Yerranola stumble. A black arrow shaft was sticking out of her chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yerranola!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik shouted. Peki's head whipped around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Arrows! Take cover!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked around. But &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; was gone. Yerranola lay on the deck. Wil scrambled to his feet. He ran to Yerranola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yerra? Speak to me! Are you alright?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This couldn't be happening. Not now. Not after so much. Not after their adventure had—he saw the Selphid raising her head. Grinning, weakly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm okay. I just got scratched! Dead body, remember? I'm alright. I just—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was smiling. Laughing. Her expression froze. Her head fell back. Wil reached for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yerranola?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid was silent. Wil shook her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He waited. But the dead face didn't move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yerra?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">489231</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 05:43:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - Interlude – Strategists at Sea (Pt. 1)</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/487748</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As was his wont, Niers Astoragon was taking private time for himself, rather than moving from city to city to conduct surprise inspections, or managing his company, teaching his students, or the thousand and one things he liked to do to keep himself occupied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In fact—free time was something he was notoriously averse to. But of late, he'd been regularly scheduling break-time in which anyone interrupting him was immediately attacked—usually with a thrown pencil or the nearest object at hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Of course, those close to him knew the Fraerling's good mood was because his &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; board had arrived. And his opponent and the world's most famous [Strategist] now regularly played—and communicated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was their thing. And the Titan was in a good mood. For a while. But he liked to be too complex for any one singular emotion at a time. And the game with his opponent aside—he was a bit perturbed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peclir. Where's the files on…Talenqual?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Fraerling was exasperatedly sorting through the notes in one of his miniature file cabinets as the [Chamberlain] walked in to serve Niers a cup of tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not, in fact, a Titan-sized cup which was in fact a tiny cup made for Fraerlings, but a regular, Human-sized cup of tea. Niers could eat and drink his body weight as could all Fraerlings due to their unnatural and magical constitutions. However…it was still a lot of caffeine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bottom drawer, third cabinet from the left, sir. If you haven't changed your filing system."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan grunted as he yanked open a drawer. He rifled through the files and pulled one out. Then he glanced up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Put the cup there, Peclir. Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trouble, sir?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just your usual annoyances. The Flying Brigade, eh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers busied himself with his reports until Peclir had put down the tea and left. Only then did the Titan check to make sure the door was closed, sweep the room twice with one of his numerous seeing spells for any observers, magical or otherwise. And after that he still murmured to himself in a low tone of voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He trusted Peclir; the man was an essential part of the headquarters of the Forgotten Wing company. However—Niers hadn't confided this with Foliana yet. It was too close. Too…vast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet—she hadn't arrived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers Astoragon sighed. Peclir himself had made the arrangements, through Venaz, at Niers' request. It had been just a whim, born of Daquin and a chance encounter with a City Runner—well, a [Rower] named Luan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Send the Last Light of Baleros here. How hard could it be?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers flipped through the reports, organized by date. He frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something must have prevented her from making the scheduled meeting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He'd kept tabs, as he did with the guest speakers or visitors to his academy. He liked to bring in any number of people, from [Veterans] who could share their experiences on the front lines to active-duty [Commanders] to [Mages], and so on. After all, his students would become the best in the world and Niers Astoragon intended them to learn from a variety of sources, including himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ordinarily, the famed [Doctor] and member of the United Nations company, Geneva Scala, would have arrived to lecture or demonstrate her abilities, as Peclir had arranged. There was even a travel expense and fee for her presentation, obviously. But she'd cancelled at the last minute, refunded the fee. The question was: &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers Astoragon was all too aware of his position. If he demanded it, an entire army could march on Talenqual at a moment's notice, sack the entire city if he needed to, and take the [Doctor]. All on a hunch. All on a supposition that her company was made of…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he wouldn't do that. For one thing, Niers Astoragon believed in things like &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; killing innocent people if you could help it. Secondly, any move he made was watched by the other three Great Companies of Baleros and any number of his enemies. He had to be stealthy in how he met Geneva. A month's lead, or a few weeks? It could mean everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And yet, and yet. Why wasn't she here? Niers consulted his reports. There were clues in the meticulous details his [Informants] and [Spymasters] sent to him. And here—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Light of Baleros is treating victims of Yellow Rivers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Just a line in one of the latest reports. As well as figures. Treating victims. Niers read it, and then began to cross-reference the data with other reports in other folders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;By the time the door to his study swung open and an invisible Squirrelwoman hopped in, Niers Astoragon was swearing. He didn't even bother trying to locate the invisible [Rogue].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Close the door, Foliana. We have a problem."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You could say that. We might have a plague on our hands."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers threw down the reports. How had no one noticed? &lt;em&gt;Brothels&lt;/em&gt; across every major city. Foliana reappeared as she perched in a chair by the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How do you know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There are cases of this disease. Yellow Rivers, it's being called. Something incredibly nasty spreading through brothels and armies. I didn't take much heed and most people haven't. It's like any number of regular illnesses. But look. Talenqual, top of the page."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Foliana read the latest report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The Last Light of Baleros—Geneva Scala, United Nations company—treating Yellow Rivers disease in two children. Different symptoms, but similar. &lt;/em&gt;Ew."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not what you think. Unless I'm mistaken, they &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; get it normally. If they did, you can add some people to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; list. But I think this sickness has multiple ways of being contracted. And if so…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers paused. That explained a lot. And he began to worry. The [Strategist] paced back and forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Yellow Rivers disease? Let's hope it's not a magical plague. Like the Sporepits Plague. Millions died."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a difference in plague vs…&lt;em&gt;plague.&lt;/em&gt; You could take down a normal illness with some Skills, for instance. [Healers] were good at fighting infection depending on their level. But magical plagues? They could wipe the world clean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I need to investigate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This [Doctor]? Why? Give her more money, mm. If you're worried."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Foliana glanced at Niers. He hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's deeper than that, Foliana. Don't pry. For now. But this means my plans have changed. Damn. I need…an agent. Or two. Happily, the students are on summer classes. Hm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He scratched at his beard. Foliana watched him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Many of his students had left. For their homes, to visit their families, for a vacation from the grind that was class at his academy. And a small group had gone…to sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Huh. Wil would have been my first pick. Or Yerra, or Feshi, honestly. Umina and Marian I know, but—well, Umina's troublesome for a number of reasons of late. And Marian is surprisingly weak at improvisation in the ways I'd need."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers mused to himself. Foliana tilted her head left and right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you regret sending them on the treasure hunt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Titan looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Those six? Never. It will be good for them. It's just inconvenient for me at this moment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He meant Venaz, Wil, Feshi, Yerranola, Merrik, and Peki. Niers hadn't chosen the group, but he had given Wil the map. And now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were at sea. Hunting for sunken wrecks. Having an adventure. The one Wil Kallinad had always dreamed of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An adventure. Foliana and Niers glanced at each other. And the old leaders remembered their youth as adventurers. Foliana sipped from Niers' tea cup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It will be dangerous. They might die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's &lt;em&gt;my tea&lt;/em&gt;, you overgrown tree rat!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers swore. But he nodded as Foliana put down the cup. He stomped over to it and looked around for the long straw he used. Or the mini-cup he could scoop his drink out of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True. It's dangerous. But the seas have their own rules. More importantly—it will be good for them. All of them could use the experience. They're all…incomplete as students. You know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. You must be a bad teacher. Mhm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers ignored Foliana. He counted on his fingers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Each of them has weaknesses. Venaz is astoundingly competent in every area, as befits a [Strategist] who has seen combat. The Isles of Minos sent their best. But he's as pig-headed as Marian; arrogance &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; run in the blood of both species. He needs to learn when to run. Wil's far better than thinks he is, but he's hesitant to be bold. And when he does? Pig-headed, again. He'll burn himself fighting, like he did against Tulm rather than go crafty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Isn't it bull-headed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't interrupt me, Foliana. I know which animal I mean. Yerranola and Feshi are good at craft, but they suffer from relying on cunning over trusting their ability to win a death match. Come to that—they haven't &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; that experience yet. Merrik and Peki? Fine commanders, if you give them orders. But they need to open their heads."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could do it with a knife. So does this adventure make them better? Fix their problems?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Foliana was being classically unhelpful. Niers sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not the point. None of these things are problems. Each of them would make a fine [Strategist] in their own way. You don't need to patch every hole in your style. It's just—what they lack isn't one singular flaw. It's this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He walked over and poked at Foliana's arm. A grey patch of fur. She shooed him away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rude."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers laughed as he stroked his own white and grey beard. Mostly turning to grey, or white. How time caught up with you. He looked at Foliana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They don't need any one thing, Foliana. What they need is…the adventure. They're young. They have to experience…everything."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She paused. And her eyes flickered. Now, Foliana understood. And she nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But they could die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Or find no treasure at all. But that's what an adventure is. I hope they all come back safely. And with treasure. But that's an adventure. And the seas?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Niers leaned on the lip of the cup. He stared out the window, at the sky. And he smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let the young have their adventure, Foliana. We have work to do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean you. &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; on holiday."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And far from where the two were sitting, as Niers threw his tea at Foliana, far from even the continent of Baleros, on the vast seas, a younger [Strategist] named Wil Kallinad looked at those same skies. And he sighed too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because adventure wasn't all it was cracked up to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It turned out that the sea was boring. Crossing it, that was. By and large, it got &lt;em&gt;boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was what Wil Kallinad hadn't known. Well, he'd &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; it, having crossed the sea once, but he'd assumed it would be different for…an adventure. And this was what it was, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An adventure.&lt;/em&gt; The high seas, the wind in your hair, searching for the sunken shipwrecks of old. For &lt;em&gt;treasure&lt;/em&gt;, from perhaps thousands of years past. Fighting monsters, evading [Pirates]—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It had been two, two and a half weeks at sea. And Wil Kallinad looked up from the diary he was keeping. He didn't have much to write.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Water. Water. Water. Water. Waaaaaater. Water. Water. Water? Water. Water…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone was saying the word over and over again in the background. Just to be fun, she varied how she said the word 'water' every few times. That meant you couldn't quite tune her voice out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods, I swear I will drown you in this drink, Peki. Shut up!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another, deeper voice swore from the left. Wil saw a Dwarf, short, stout, with huge arms and a frame that made him stronger than most Human men sit up at the table. The voice stopped for a second and then came back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Make me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The speaker was a Garuda. Her feathers were predominantly green, but mixed with yellow and red. She was a splash of color in the cabin's interior. And the small room she and Wil and Merrik were sitting in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With a sigh, Wil closed his diary. Mainly to stop the fight he knew was about to break out. Merrik reached under his bunk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh yeah? &lt;em&gt;Oh yeah?&lt;/em&gt; Try it, you overgrown parrot. Hold on, where's my hammer? Hold on, I said!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The five-foot tall Dwarf tried to fend Peki off as she leapt off the bunk she'd been sitting on. It was Wil's bunk; he and Venaz were sharing a room. Merrik and Peki had invaded his because they were bored. Now, the Garuda [Martial Artist] and [Commander] danced forwards, and punched Merrik in the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ow! Stop it! I need my axe! And my armor!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fighting doesn't wait for clothes. Make me stop. Make me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peki—please stop punching Merrik."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda obligingly put the Dwarf in a headlock. Merrik swore as he grabbed at her arms, but light as Peki was—she was an expert in unarmed combat. He couldn't break free, or use his own considerable strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Headlocks too, Peki. Please stop fighting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda let go of Merrik with a sigh. The Dwarf &lt;em&gt;gasped&lt;/em&gt; for air. Red-faced, he glared at the Garuda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If I had my hammer or my armor on—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd hit you on the head. Easy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You were &lt;em&gt;strangling&lt;/em&gt; me. I have [Body of Stone]! Try punching me and see how that goes! I dare you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki raised a fist. Merrik held up his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Not without my helmet! &lt;/em&gt;I don't want a concussion again! I'm just saying that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; I had my helmet—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd still win."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil sighed. The two were in his cabin because they had been getting on each other's nerves and wanted company. But he didn't exactly want &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; company. Still—there was a limited amount of space on deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It had been nearly three weeks. Three weeks of…inaction. A storm had been the most excitement they'd had. The [Strategists] had been prepared for calamity and shipwreck, monsters and trouble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had not been prepared for boredom. And in the confines of this tiny vessel…it was getting to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why don't we go upstairs? The fresh air will do us all some good. We're nearly at the next location, anyways."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil hopefully suggested. Peki and Merrik looked at him. Their faces indicated what they thought of that suggestion, but they grudgingly acquiesced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, glorious daylight. How I've not missed you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik announced as they trooped upstairs. Technically, the term was &lt;em&gt;on deck&lt;/em&gt;, but none of the [Strategists] were sailors. And using the lingo felt silly at times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where's Venaz? Feshi? Yerra?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil looked for the other three [Strategists] who were his companions for the voyage. The ship was far from empty of course; it was a galleon, large, with a vast crew of over three hundred hands. They were on deck, adjusting the sails, calling out to each other, performing different tasks—but the three [Strategists] were passengers. Apart, aloof, separate from the [Sailors].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Over there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki fluttered up, towards the front of the ship. The Garuda's ability to casually fly always struck Wil with envy when he saw it. But today at least, Peki didn't seem to feel like swooping around. She did fly each day, and practice her exercises, but even the [Martial Artist] seemed to get bored of training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was pointing to a group at the front, or prow of the ship. Peki flew ahead of Merrik and Wil as the [Sailors] navigated around them. They were both used to the sway of the ship, but neither could move as nimbly as the [Storm Sailors].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Storm Sailors], the regulars of the sea. This was a ship led by a [Storm Captain], and crewed by [Storm Sailors]. Such ships were considered better than most trade ships, because while they were common, you had to earn the [Storm Sailor] class and its counterpart as a [Captain].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They weren't always honorable ships either. Sometimes, they were. But a [Storm Captain] could turn to piracy if need be. The sea was a different place than on land. There were few [Knights] who fought at sea. And the sea…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sea was &lt;em&gt;boring. &lt;/em&gt;Honestly. It was. Wil stared at the relatively flat landscape of green and blue as he walked with Merrik grumbling about arrogant Garuda. It was a matter of perspective, he supposed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sea contained [Pirates]. Monsters. Treasure. Adventure, and drama and romance and everything in between, just like land. The &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; was that there was a substantially larger amount of sea than land. And the continents were &lt;em&gt;vast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the sea was vaster. And when all you experienced of it was the top portion (which was the least notable part of the sea, which extended miles into the dark waters below), you tended to get a lot of uniformity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it wasn't as if Wil or Merrik could walk off the ship and go for a nice stroll on the waves. Neither of them had Waterwalking Boots, and even Peki couldn't fly far. Besides, what was there to do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well—one thing you could do was bring entertainment. And at this moment, three [Strategists] were playing chess at a table set up near the front of the boat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was playing Feshi, and Yerranola spectating. It was a game of chess. A tradition among Niers Astoragon's students. Only—there wasn't so much rapt attention and competitiveness among the two players so much as…vague disinterest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Check."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur, Venaz, spoke curtly as Peki flew over towards them. Feshi moved a piece out of the way. Venaz moved a piece.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Check. Again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi moved her king. Venaz moved his piece a third time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Checkmate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You win."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The female Gnoll pushed over her king with a sigh. Venaz stared at the board. He didn't gloat, or point out her mistakes as he had the first hundred times they'd played on the ship. This time he just sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Another match? Oh look, there's Wil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yaaaaay."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola slid down in her seat. The Selphid was wearing a female Human's body for the trip; she'd brought a few bodies and kept switching them out to keep them 'fresh'. She stared up at the sky. Wil and Merrik slowly walked over to them, the same…look on their faces. They were getting close to the sixth location. But none of them had any excitement left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ship turning! 'Ware the boom!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice cracked across the deck. The [Strategists] looked up. Now &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; was someone with some pep in her voice. A [Storm Sailor] glared across the deck as she shouted at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ship was indeed turning. At the prow, the [Captain], Captain Lasc, was turning the ship, moving the thick ship's wheel. All well and good. Venaz went back to staring at the chessboard. His right eye was twitching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were &lt;em&gt;bored&lt;/em&gt;. Venaz sighed as he pushed the chess board back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not in the mood to play. Feshi, Yerra?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two chorused as one. Venaz nodded. With care, he put the carved stone pieces into his bag of holding, and the board.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe we should bring out the scrying orb. Hopefully there' something &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Television had come to this world. But watching it all day still made you go insane. The others were nodding. And the voice cried out again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Watch the sea-cursed boom, you idiot bird!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked up. Peki glanced around. Just in time to see the boom of the ship and sail &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; with the galleon. Because…that was what happened when a ship turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All the [Storm Sailors] were out of the way. But the inattentive Garuda, who did not voyage on the sea, was directly in the path of the ship's boom. And it swung into her and &lt;em&gt;smacked&lt;/em&gt; her out of the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peki!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola sat up quick. Feshi and Venaz saw the Garuda hit the deck, roll, and spring up. Venaz sat forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hah!&lt;/em&gt; That was entertaining!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki was unharmed. She'd tried to block the boom, and then, realizing that was impossible, transferred the energy into the roll. She was patting her ruffled feathers down as Wil and Merrik strode over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peki! How many times &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that? &lt;em&gt;Eighteen?&lt;/em&gt; Watch the boom!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik needled Peki as the Garuda eyed the offending boom of the ship—which was connected to the sails, which a ship would turn to catch the wind. That was also how ships worked, incidentally. And when a ship turned—or the wind blew hard, the boom moved. By accident, it was called a jibe. Either way—you watched the boom. Everyone seemed to get that but Peki.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Didn't hurt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda defiantly flicked her wings out. Merrik rolled his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And it still swats you each time! I thought you were a [Martial Artist] from Pomle!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Am."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, you seem to get hit by a &lt;em&gt;ship&lt;/em&gt; quite often."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can hit you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki raised a fist. Merrik raised his and Venaz got up, looking excited. But before another brawl could break out—a [Storm Sailor] strode across the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Oi, you salt-brained sack of scum! Don't you learn? Watch the boom!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She bellowed at Peki, pointing angrily at the piece of the ship. Peki and the other students from the Titan's academy turned and stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They saw a [Storm Sailor] glaring at them. One of many on the ship. They had names. Personalities. Some of them were probably people. But they didn't make a point of getting to know Wil and his friends. Wil was familiar with the [First Mate], Delivan, and Captain Lasc, but all the others were a blur of 'don't touch that', or 'captain's orders', or 'you're in the way' to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was just another one. Only—she—stood out. She was short, as [Sailors] went. Skin dark, tanned from the sun. Dressed in a [Sailor]'s garb, relatively lightweight and not entangling to avoid issues if you had to swim. Sleeves and leggings rolled up, crusted with salt; you didn't wash often on a ship, and hopefully didn't need to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, her legging was rolled up on one leg on her left side. Her right…leg…was harder to roll up on so she'd just cut the cloth away. That helped her octopus-leg stand on the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategists] stared. The [Storm Sailor] &lt;em&gt;glared&lt;/em&gt; at them. She pointed at Peki.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You got stuffing in your ears?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had…two normal arms. One normal leg. A normal, Human face. So she wasn't your classic Drowned Woman, or one of the Drowned People in general. You could normally tell because half of their bodies were some sort of sea creature's. Just her leg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Oh—and when she opened her mouth, Wil saw a &lt;em&gt;beak&lt;/em&gt; in her mouth. An interior set of jaws. Like a bird's jaw, but—different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A cephalopod's beak, in fact. An octopus' beak they used to eat. That was an octopus-fact. It was a second mouth &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; her mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailor] didn't seem to care about the stares. She pointed at Peki.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stay out of the way of the boom, you got that, landbird?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki stared at the beak. Then she stared at the [Sailor]. She shrugged, face blank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why? Doesn't hurt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The short [Sailor] looked incredulous. Her right tentacle-leg extended a bit, and she stood tilted slightly left, slightly taller.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You? Who cares about &lt;em&gt;you? &lt;/em&gt;If you hit the damn mainsail, there'll be hell to pay! I've seen you &lt;em&gt;punching&lt;/em&gt; the boom as well! You crack the wood, Captain Lasc'll be eating chicken tonight!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki looked blank. Her classmates stared at her. The [Storm Sailor] stared and her jaw worked as she tried to figure out if Peki was being funny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He'll have you tossed in the ocean! Stop flying about like an idiot!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all she came up with. Then she stomped off. Well—one foot stomped. Wil and the others watched her go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Amazing. See how her leg's moving? It's not a balanced walk by any means. But the tentacle-leg actually works on a moving deck. Imagine her trying to run. On land."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz whispered a bit too loudly. The others looked at him. Wil slowly sat down, boredom forgotten for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've never seen anyone like that. She's not fully Drowned Person, is she?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. And [Storm Sailors] don't like to crew with them. Rivalry on the sea. We &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to ask about it. Hey. Hey, &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik instantly waved at the nearest [Sailor] passing by. The man grunted; he was swabbing the deck. People &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;had to do that. It was to keep it from allowing moss or mold to grow, and to keep the planks wet and thus swelled with water to prevent leaks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;More ship-facts. The [Sailor] grunted, but he leaned on his mop as he came over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His tone wasn't exactly &lt;em&gt;polite&lt;/em&gt; for guests, but he wasn't spitting on them either. Merrik waved conspiratorially at the part-octopus [Sailor].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's up with &lt;em&gt;her?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Merrik. We shouldn't gossip."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Why not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf looked at Wil. The Terandrian [Lord] hesitated, but the [Sailor] turned out to be only too happy to gossip. He looked around conspiratorially.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Her? The one that just yelled at you? Oh, that's Inky. She's got a tongue on her almost as bad as that fucking beak."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategists] were instantly fascinated. This was the highlight of their day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tell us more. Take a seat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I should be working."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man hesitated. But Venaz instantly pulled one of the chairs out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're chartering this ship. Sit down."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur ordered. The [Sailor] weighed this, glanced about, and sat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Whaddya want to know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everything. What's with the beak, the leg—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Does she have any more octopus parts? That is octopus, right? Not squid?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola was as fascinated as Merrik and the others. Of course, the Selphid was a body-connoisseur. She looked at people…mainly for their bodies. The man just shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'd have to ask some of her mates."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you mean mates as in—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Merrik. Don't be disgusting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi reached over and &lt;em&gt;poked&lt;/em&gt; the Dwarf with her paw, hard. The Dwarf grunted. The [Sailor] however seemed to appreciate the Dwarf's humor. But Merrik was a friendly sort. Everyone got along with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If we're all her mates, it's only a few who've seen underneath. And only a few cared to if you get my drift. She's part-Drowned. Part octopus, aye. You saw the beak and the leg? The rest's just ink and suckers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Suckers?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"On her hands. And the soles of her feet, so I hear. She spits ink and makes it everywhere else. That's the name. She's not one of ours. Just a crewing member for the trip. But she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a [Storm Sailor], so old Lasc took her on. I've seen her twice; she knows the job, but she ain't ours."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;By 'ours', he meant a member of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. The regulars versus the people they might hire on for the journey. The students nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're not a fan of hers. Why, does she cause trouble?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sailor] hesitated. Yerranola instantly poured a drink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fancy some rum? Straight from the larder."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't mind if I do. Thanks. You lot are alright!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sailor] downed the shot appreciatively. He wiped his mouth and went on, lowering his voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nah, she's good at her job. Wouldn't be part of the crew otherwise. Helps kick the others into shape. But she's—you know? Part &lt;em&gt;fish?&lt;/em&gt; One of them. Drowned Folk. Only, they wouldn't take her, so she crews with us air breathers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He spat to the side. Wil frowned. It was Feshi who asked the obvious. The Gnoll leaned over. Parts of her fur were dyed with color, but she hadn't kept it up of late. Feshi Weatherfur cast an eye towards Inky, who was walking over to the mast. She put her hands on the mast and instead of grabbing onto any ladder or handholds, just &lt;em&gt;climbed&lt;/em&gt; up the mast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Suckers. See? Unnatural. But she's the daughter of a Drowned Person and a Human. Don't know the details, don't care. But she didn't take the Sea's Bargain—don't know if she &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, since she's already part something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sailor] explained. His name was Begal. Or his nickname. Sailors were big on nicknames. That was probably his actual name, though. Like Inky, he'd been born to sailor's families and lived on the sea all his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he was all normal, for all his heritage was mixed through multiple species. He had a bit of Gnoll—even a bit of Drake in his ancestry, way back, which tickled Feshi's fancy no end. But they didn't &lt;em&gt;count,&lt;/em&gt; as Begal explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"On the sea, there's only Drowned and non-Drowned. And Drathians, if you want to get technical. They're an odd bunch. But they're still not &lt;em&gt;Drowned Folk.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's so wrong with them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Begal's brow darkened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're at war with us non-seabreathers. You know [Pirates]? Most of 'em are Drowned Vessels. Sure, lots are [Pirates], but Drowned Vessels'll sink both [Pirates] &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; regular ships. They're a law of their own. A nation without borders under the sea. Well, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; claim the entire sea's theirs. Bastards, most of 'em. No [Sailor]'ll crew with a Drowned bastard."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…And a part-Drowned person?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil was eying Begal's face and Inky as she kept climbing towards the crow's nest to relieve whomever was on watch. The man shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, they were kicked out of the Drowned since they're not fish &lt;em&gt;enough.&lt;/em&gt; Their faces aren't, you see? Can't breathe in water. And I suppose the Drowned folk don't like anyone who's not taken the Sea's Bargain of their own will."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sea's Bargain. It's when they join with something of the deeps. Become part-fish, part-crab, part-clam—whatever it is. Anyways, Inky can crew since she has the class—dead gods, &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; not a [Storm Sailor] so Lasc'll use anyone who's got the class. But she's not and never will be one of us. You feel me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other students nodded. Begal nodded. He pushed himself up after a third shot of rum and nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You students from the Titan are alright, then. Didn't think you'd be, but you're not half as bad as the other lot we've had onboard. Thanks for the drink."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He nodded at them and hurried back to his duties before he could catch the eye of any of his superiors. The [Strategists] kept quiet for a few seconds until he was out of earshot, then Yerranola spoke up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So how much of that is a [Sailor]'s tales and how much is real, I wonder?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? The man just told us everything there was to know, Yerra."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz raised his brows. The Selphid glanced back at him. She was frowning, and Wil, sitting to her left, knew Yerranola was vexed. Not quite why, yet, but she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hear it's not like that for Drowned Folk. And they're hardly the scourge of the seas. Lots are quite peaceful, but it's [Storm Sailors] and other marauders they fear. And if that's how they're treated, no wonder. It's a wonder Inky crews with this ship if this is how she's treated, but maybe she doesn't have a choice. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the Sea's Bargain doesn't work like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She folded her arms. Venaz gave her an incredulous snort. The Minotaur folded his arms and flapped one hand airily. He had…strong opinions which his fellow students were used to. Even so, his superior tone grated at times. Most of the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yerra, I grew up in the isles of Minos. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the sea, and that [Sailor] told us nothing I haven't heard myself from every manner of sea folk. Drowned People are dangerous."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not all of them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra's eyes flashed and she clenched a long-dead hand. Wil eyed her, worriedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yerra—don't mind Venaz."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm just saying—what did Inky do to deserve being talked to like that? The man—Begal—even said she's a good [Sailor]! What has she done? He didn't name a thing except that she was part-Drowned! And she was born that way!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She yelled at me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki refused a shot as Merrik poured another round for the students. So did Wil, but Feshi, Venaz, and Yerra all drank up with Merrik. Yerra was glaring at Venaz. Wil was trying to calm her down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't often that Yerranola, as affable as Merrik—perhaps even more so—got angry. It was surprising to Venaz and Feshi, who knew her from class, but Wil, who was close friends with Yerra and recently, Feshi and Venaz, knew his friend. The Selphid was touchy about…outsiders. She herself had experienced enough of what she was seeing or projecting onto Inky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Either way, the lesson is to not get hit by the boom. Peki."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll dodge it next time. It's fast. Good training."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others rolled their eyes or sighed. But they relaxed, after that brief moment of interest and insight into their monotony. After a few seconds, Venaz produced the scrying orb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;And now, I believe we have a performance by a high-level [Bard]. Let me get the name. And there's some to-do about a marriage going off-the-road so to speak, between a…Lord Bein and Lady Hetessana of northern Izril? Am I pronouncing that right? No, wait. Lord Bein and Lady Dealia. Apparently, the [Lord] was allegedly cheating on his fiancé with a Lady Hetessana Wellfar…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others groaned as the now-familiar voice of Noass began speaking. Sometimes he would cut to fascinating things like the battle in Jecrass, but the King of Destruction's armies still had to move and clashes were fast and usually not caught 'live' as it were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And it was a week still before the drama around Lord Bein's infidelity would come to a head. Wil saw the broadcast cut to a [Bard], who bowed towards the audience and began to declaim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh &lt;em&gt;tribes.&lt;/em&gt; Venaz, turn it off. I cannot &lt;em&gt;handle&lt;/em&gt; another Terandrian ballad, no?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi groaned as she covered her ears. The Minotaur sighed. He slapped the scrying orb into his bag of holding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What then? Another game of damn chess? Go? Shogi?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, no, and no. Can't we get drunk?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm bored of being &lt;em&gt;drunk&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik slammed his cup down. The others nodded. Venaz cast about for anything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Swimming then? What about a simulated battle, Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll just get left behind the ship again, Venaz. And we always argue about how we run the simulation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was true. The Minotaur flopped back down on deck and stared vacantly into the horizon. His hands moved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's just—we need—figurines. Like the Professor has. And &lt;em&gt;rules.&lt;/em&gt; That would make it easier. Some way of…of deciding arguments, instead of which battalion would win an engagement."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Like a board? Sounds like a game."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes! But…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur trailed off. The others leaned on the table. Bored, bored, bored. None of them looked at Wil, but he sat there. Staring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;After an indeterminate amount of time, someone spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're nearly at the next spot, ladies and gents. Captain Lasc wants to know if any of you'll be wanting to watch the proceedings?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan, the First Mate of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; approached the table with the bored students. Wil looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sea…didn't &lt;em&gt;look &lt;/em&gt;too different. Ah—but wait. There was a distant rock. And something like an island in the far distance? It was precisely where Niers had written the shipwreck might be. Wil rose to his feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll go, of course. Captain Lasc has my gratitude."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The details were exceedingly precise, Lord Kallinad. Anyone else? If you'll be wantin' to dive, we can get some of the suits rigged. Excepting, well…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man looked at Merrik, Peki, and Venaz, all three of which wouldn't fit the diving suits. Wil saw all three wave their hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't think that will be necessary, Delivan. But I will watch. Anyone coming?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at each other. Yerranola rose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll come, Wil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was mainly friendship that made her speak. The others shook their heads. Slowly, Wil, the [First Mate] and the Selphid walked off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alongside one section of the deck there was a bustle. [Sailors] were congregated around a group of [Divers] getting ready to jump into the ocean. Some had suits on—with helmets made of glass and metal. Others? They were practically naked, stripping down, only taking a single glass bottle plus a stone or weight to help them sink. Yet more had an amulet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Divers]. Bottles of compressed air. Diving suits. Or just Amulets of Waterbreathing. There were any number of techniques to brave the ocean even if you weren't a Drowned Person. And &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;, which had been hired to help Wil investigate Niers' list, was specialized in recovering shipwrecks, among other things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Normally—or rather, at first—the other [Strategists] would have been &lt;em&gt;all over&lt;/em&gt; the proceedings, wanting to try to dive or borrow an amulet from the experienced divers. And worrying about monster attacks, speculating over the treasure—asking why most of the [Divers] would have to stop at regular intervals on the way back up to avoid being sick or dying. The bends, a phenomenon unfamiliar to most landlubbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And they had been. Especially over the diving bell, the metal container that would be heaved over the edge of the ship and lowered to preserve air and pressure. Not all the [Divers] would use it; but only because nearly forty would be going down through various methods. They had been so excited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The first five times. But all the excitement, the hype, all of it had turned to disappointment the first few times. But the students had known that treasure wasn't guaranteed, or even likely after all this time. They had told themselves that the second time. And the third. And the fourth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time Wil and Yerra went off to watch as Captain Lasc marched down the deck. Few of the [Sailors] were watching too. Although—and here was a brief spark of interest—Inky was one of the [Divers]. She had an Amulet of Waterbreathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There. If she can breathe underwater and she's not accepted on a Drowned Crew, it must be prejudice as that Begal said. I was right."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz pointed that out to the others. Feshi sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz, you are more stubborn than one of my clan's dogs with a bone. Drop it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur &lt;em&gt;harrumphed&lt;/em&gt;, but he said nothing more as the others watched the [Divers] go under and the diving bell being lowered. It was Merrik who sighed and looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay, I bet…forty six hypothetical gold pieces that we find something this time. Even if it's a minor artifact or gold."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No bet. That's too open-ended."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi instantly replied. The dives &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; found objects before. Some gold, a few very minor objects like a green vase that turned out to be silver—but all the wrecks had been picked clean. Or the undersea currents or something had moved the contents. Or there hadn't been anything to begin with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why forty-six hypothetical gold pieces? Hypothetical?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz stared at Merrik. The Dwarf shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If I was going to bet them. Hypothetical, yeah. Peki and I bet them all the time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am one hundred and eighty two hypothetical gold coins in debt. I bet thirty nothing comes up, Merrik."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda nodded as she dipped her beak into a glass of water. Venaz frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But why did Merrik bet &lt;em&gt;forty six?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was really bothering him. Merrik ignored the Minotaur as he turned to Feshi. The Gnoll was idly fiddling with a bone necklace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was Feshi Weatherfur, of the Weatherfur tribe. As was her tribe's custom, she dyed parts of her fur different colors. Beyond that? She, like many had come to the Titan's Academy to become one of the world's best [Strategists].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was very good at ambushes, moving battles—not as good as Marian, but she was in the special class for the best students. If she had any specialty, it was laying traps. But she wasn't the class' best. Now, she sighed through her nose as she sprawled out on the table. Merrik eyed her sidelong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Feshi, You know what I'd do if we are on Terandria and had forty-six gold pieces? No—if we were home? We should visit, by the way. Once we're done with…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured at the people at the railings on the port side, calling out to each other, checking to see if anyone wanted to come up. Wil was there, looking tense. Upset. Yerra was patting him on the shoulder, clearly trying to get him to laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can't. We're going to Izril. I need to attend the Meeting of Tribes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, yeah. Damn, I forgot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik sighed. He went on though, undeterred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Terandria's a great place, though. Safe. Safer than Baleros. Still has its fair share of monsters—well, you can't eradicate them. But it's got some good places. Like my home. You should all visit. It's a wonderful mountain city."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others nodded. Merrik looked around and his voice rose slightly, with the confidence of all those far from home had that their home was special.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It &lt;em&gt;is!&lt;/em&gt; Come and visit!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz stirred. He looked up over his umpteenth cup of the strong swill the [Sailors] favored. It was being provided to the guests free of charge. Well—Wil's family had paid a small fortune to hire the vessel and crew for his adventure. Venaz had been calculating just how much money would be lost. For…fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean, the mountain of the Dwarves? Dwarfhome Mountains?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik snorted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's just the colloquial name. Dwarfhome. &lt;em&gt;Technically,&lt;/em&gt; we're the Mountain Kingdom of the Dwarves, Deríthal-vel. But most people can't pronounce that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Derithal-vel. There. And why are we visiting? For the lovely sights of a…mountain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You pronounced it wrong."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik smiled smugly at Venaz's glare. He shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's the place to buy weaponry! I thought &lt;em&gt;you'd&lt;/em&gt; appreciate that. Even you, Feshi. There are some decent [Bowyers] there, but you could buy a bow made of metal!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pass. And I'm not interested in a bunch of Dwarves. Too short for me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll sighed. Merrik ignored that crack. But Venaz seemed to take that as another point against visiting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've always been curious. But what do Dwarven women…? We don't get many Dwarves in the House of Minos. So do they have…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He made a gesture for a beard. Peki began laughing. Merrik glared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey! It's not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Dwarven women. Most look Human and not all of 'em have beards. That's stereotyping, right there. Actually…most don't have beards. That's a weird fetish. Don't understand it myself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? How many other species are there?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other students listened as they watched one of the divers return. Inky. She was already shaking her head at Captain Lasc, but he was clearly ordering her back down. Merrik had to think about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Humans are a good population in Dwarfhome. And apprentices from every species come to learn our craft. 'sides, us Dwarves have a lot of Human blood in us. We're taller than our forefathers were…mostly because of all the interspecies marriages. Tens of thousands of years of it. But Dwarf blood is stubborn. Still."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He shrugged. Venaz nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How defensible is Derithal-vel?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Still saying it wrong. Very defensible. We're &lt;em&gt;Dwarves.&lt;/em&gt; We have Dwarven steel—the best [Smiths]…but we don't fight in many wars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not even the one with Ailendamus and the other nations? Isn't Wil's homeland potentially part of that? Aren't you worried?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi was searching for some salted fish. She gnawed on it and shared it around; the others ate mainly to have something to do. But it did help make them thirsty for the drink, which made them willing to eat the fish…Merrik grunted. He looked a bit sad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, well. We go to war now and then. But we're attacked seldom. Truth is…Dwarfhome is mostly a giant smithy. We provide arms, sometimes take sides. But Terandria relies on our steel. And there aren't enough of us to kick around in an army anymore. Well, not that we want to lose. Good numbers, but not compared to all the Humans in the rest of the continent."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Declining populations?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You try outbreeding Humans."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The four [Strategists] shared a hearty laugh. Some of the passing [Sailors] looked sideways at them, but the other four species nodded at each other. Merrik sobered. But then he smiled, suddenly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True, we don't invite war because it's dangerous. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; there's another reason for it. We don't get attacked because Dwarfhome has never been taken once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He folded his arms. The other [Strategists] glanced at him. It was the kind of statement that invited instant ridicule for anyone in the Titan's classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What, &lt;em&gt;never? &lt;/em&gt;You're pulling gold out of your ass, Merrik. Don't give me that look, Peki, that's how the saying goes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz snorted incredulously. Merrik's eyes twinkled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not. You can debate it as much as you want, but that's not a false claim. Not. Ever. We've &lt;em&gt;surrendered&lt;/em&gt;, but no one's ever breached Dwarfhome by force of arms."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What about surrender via attrition? Starvation?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope. Surrendered because we didn't want a bloodbath. But never starved to death. And even when we endured decades-long sieges—they stormed us and never got through. Not. Once. Top that? Not a bad reason to visit, eh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf leaned back, looking satisfied. It was a challenge. The other [Strategists] glanced at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not bad. But Minos is a paradise. Almost no crime—safety—[Warriors] who have reached a martial peak. I know Peki speaks of Pomle, but the reason I left was that Minos was &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; safe for me. Being a [Strategist] is my ticket to joining our mercenary forces. And that is an &lt;em&gt;honor&lt;/em&gt;. Only the best of Minos get to go. Did I mention I beat the [Prince] to earn the honor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Only every other day, Venaz. But if Minos is &lt;em&gt;so perfect&lt;/em&gt;, why don't more people join? Or why don't the islands expand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola strolled back over. She made a face as the others looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Diving isn't going well. Looks like another wreck."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Damn.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz swore. The others groaned and put their heads down. Venaz covered his eyes and looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No one tell Wil this, but I think he should have insisted the Professor give him whatever answer he wanted for his family. Why don't we expand, Yerra? The House of the Minos was one of the last gigantic empires. Our Kings still remember. They decree we will not be so dishonorable again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Good [Kings]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The best. Our King is wise—a seasoned warrior—we may pass by the House of Minos. If we do, I can arrange shore leave for all of you. Perhaps even an audience. She's quite generous. And the very font of honor."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;She?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Before Venaz could explain about the female King of Minotaurs, Peki spoke up suddenly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pomle is great. We don't have [Kings]. We fought to get free."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Peki! Is that national pride I hear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik chortled. The Garuda looked around defiantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pomle is strong. A hundred Pomle warriors once held off an army of a hundred thousand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, but that was when it was &lt;em&gt;founded&lt;/em&gt;. Can they still do that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda made the others pause. Merrik was pursing his lips and the others were, despite themselves, looking forwards to a good debate. But then it was Feshi's turn to sigh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I miss home. When we get to Izril, I'll take you to my clan, along with Venaz's nation. The Weatherfur clan isn't the biggest clan—well, we're pretty big. And powerful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She didn't sound very modest because she wasn't being. The others looked at her, curious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have to admit, I'm not up on Gnoll clans, Feshi. What makes the Weatherfur one unique?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik stroked his beard. Feshi smiled. She indicated her colored fur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We color our fur like the rainbow. Because we know where and when to send our flocks. We have very large ones and we predict the weather. Well—traditionally. Our clan is one of the biggest. Silverfang, Weatherfur, Ironscent—we're among the bigger ones. Not the biggest in the pack…and we lost Garusa Weatherfur. Our pride. She would have made us important at the Meeting of Tribes. I wanted to become a [Strategist] because she was a [General]. I would have…liked to serve under her command."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others stilled. Feshi looked sad. Yerranola interrupted them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If we're talking about home—you should visit a Selphid place sometime. We're friendly. Just not beloved in Baleros."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked once at Venaz. The Minotaur paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What are Selphid communities like?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra grinned. The same grin she had among all her bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Small. But some of our people are as old as Dwarves or half-Elves. We stick together. No one who's around another Selphid goes hungry. We have to stick together. You know, because of the empire."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Two species with a recent history of world domination looked at each other. Venaz gave a short nod. He sat up, looking extremely awkward. He took a long moment before he spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yerra. I may have been wrong. Why don't we ask this Inky for her side? Just to ratify…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur's not-quite-an-apology was interrupted by a sound from the side. The [Strategists] and two [Officers] looked up. Wil Kallinad was striding along the decks. His face was white. Captain Lasc, Inky, and the other [Divers] were returning. Yerra turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It didn't take them long to find out. There was nothing in the shipwreck. Inky herself had found a tag that [Treasure Seekers] used. The shipwreck had been picked over long ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Six down. Three to go. The students looked at each other. Then they went to comfort their friend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings Above and Below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing. That's the sixth one. I'm sorry, everyone. I think I've led you all on a pointless chase. That was one of the biggest leads. It was meant to be the Gailenwright's Eye. And it was nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil sat on the bed as the other five students stood around him. Venaz blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Gailenwright? &lt;/em&gt;One of the most famous ships in modern history, crewed by one of the [Pirate Lords]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't get excited Venaz. That was &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;. And it wasn't the Gailenwright. And nothing was left."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young [Lord] was still pale-faced. White, not so much with shock as with despair. The other students sobered. Venaz lowered his hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not that bad, Wil. There are still three more shots. Even if—I mean—statistically, there's still &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; chance of…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola looked around for words. But…the problem was this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was easy to say 'it's just bad luck', or 'the probability' was this. They'd been doing that the entire trip. And if it was just that, it would be easier to keep hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But all six shipwrecks hadn't just been duds. They'd been looted already. By [Divers]. [Treasure Seekers], using treasure-hunting Skills. The Titan's notes, his secret file of all possible treasures…wasn't unique.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've never thought of it, but the Professor doesn't have any real experience with sea-battles. Some, but he's not an expert on it. He's…a land-strategist. And his research might not exceed that of most treasure seekers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz muttered to himself as he sat on the lower bunk that was his bed. Feshi patted Wil on the back as Merrik poured himself another drink and offered Wil a glass. The young man refused. Peki began doing squats. No one really knew what to say that they hadn't said five times before. But reality was sinking in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad! Are you shipshape? I just need a moment, sir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A knock at the door. Captain Lasc came in as Will called out. The [Storm Captain], a hardened man from the sea, but not as bulky as you might expect—even lean, and young, for a man of his rank, saluted slightly. Wil might have been young, and he might have been a guest, but Lasc often worked for the Kallinad family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just wanted to have a word after the dive."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sure the crew is upset, Captain Lasc—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man smiled slightly, a slightly unfamiliar action to him. And he tried to moderate the tone of command that was his by right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry, sir. The crew looks at this as easy, paid work. You won't get any trouble from them and it's a fine attempt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc looked cheerful, having already resigned himself to finding little on this voyage. It was a good way to be. Not so for Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, Captain. We have only three more spots to go. Then we can proceed to Izril. Perhaps a stop at the House of Minos?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As you wish, Lord Kallinad. My crew is willing for all of it. Just wanted to let you know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The door clicked shut on Lasc's heels. Yerra spoke after a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, &lt;em&gt;he's&lt;/em&gt; cheerful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He gets paid either way. But…my family won't be as pleased."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil buried his head in his hands. It was Feshi who thoughtfully spoke up after a moment. The Gnoll looked from Wil to the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, Wil. If nothing is found on this voyage, the Professor's list was &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; wrong. Not even a bit of treasure? I think he would be as upset as you. And he might…offer you whatever it is you didn't get for your family if that turned out to be the case."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at her, surprised. Wil's head rose slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He wouldn't. Would he?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's prideful. He wanted to give you an adventure and if you didn't get it? You could…negotiate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Negotiate with the professor? For a gesture made with all his knowledge?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz looked horrified by the thought—and then thoughtful. Wil looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But that would be—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's the Titan's secret. If it's a trash secret, ask for a refund. Feshi, you're a genius!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola laughed. The Gnoll smiled to herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know him. He &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; generous, yes? It's worth bearing in mind."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That, more than anything seemed to cheer Wil up. He looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—well—we don't &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the other locations are a dud."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But if there are, we have backup. Rhir's hell, Feshi! That's genius! And it's what the Professor would approve of. Let's—hey, let's send him a [Message]! Just tell him that and ask what he says."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. That would be—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He'd &lt;em&gt;love it&lt;/em&gt;, Wil! I bet he'd bring it up in class and ask the others what they'd do!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's an excellent idea. I wish I'd had it. We can all draft the [Message]. Make him the bet—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And if it goes wrong, it was Venaz's idea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki put in. Everyone &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at the Garuda's sly look and burst out laughing. In a great humor, they began drafting the letter. And Wil smiled. But he paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three more places."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The downed ship of Archmage Zelkyr. The possible resting place of the Diamond Swords of Serept. A Dragonship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Each one a treasure to make your skin tingle. But…Wil smiled. Maybe it was the Titan's lesson after all. But he joined the others in composing a [Message] spell that night. After all—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It never hurt to ask.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And far below the ship where the six students composed a [Message] that did indeed put Niers Astoragon in stitches—and wonder if his information really was that poor—a similar conversation was being had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An underwater ship, crewed by Drowned People was following &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. But they'd stopped to check something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Depth Captain. Our scouts have found nothing in the shipwreck that the landfolk did not find. It was indeed picked clean."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [First Mate] whose body was half-starfish saluted a Drowned Captain. He was half-Eel. His name and title was Depth Captain Therrium Sailwinds of the Undersea Crews. And his ship, &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; was feared above and under the sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…He wasn't happy. He growled curses that the rest of his crew, moving in the silence of the waters, looked up fearfully to hear. Not only because his wrath was terrible, but because he had violated one of the precepts of those who sailed under the waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make no sound, lest ye attract what draws to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the cursing was short-lived. Captain Therrium, a man who had three sons, a ship to his name, and quite a lot of gold, was used to risky ventures. He just hated it when they fell through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Damn the landfolk who plundered the ship!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His voice was a deep, bubbling growl even as a whisper among the silent vessel. Of course, &lt;strong&gt;he sounded like this,&lt;/strong&gt; as did much of the Drowned Folk, but they all did, so to them it was normal conversation. The First Mate winced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Actually, Depth Captain…I think the [Divers] were ours. The marks looks so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. Well then. &lt;em&gt;Scavengers.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium moderated his tone. He sighed. And only then did he hear the muffled obscenities coming from his left. The half-Eel Drowned Man turned his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…A &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; Drowned Ship was floating next to the first, having drawn alongside. And the other [Depth Captain] was cursing through the magical barrier that kept the waters out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Damn you, Therrium! Three weeks it's been and not a sight of treasure!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; mark!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] whisper-howled back across the gulf between them. He saw a half-Shrimp Drowned Woman, her antennae moving as she furiously pointed one feeler-hand at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You don't own the ship until you've sunk it, Therrium! We have a right to the sea!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then don't curse my name for a dry spell!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Disgruntled, Therrium turned his back and motioned for the [Helmsman] to take the ship away. The other Drowned Ship drifted back as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two &lt;/em&gt;ships were following &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. Two that Therrium was aware of, including his own. More than one person had heard Yerranola and Venaz's careless slip of the tongue about the Titan's treasure. But it was turning out to be a fruitless endeavor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nevertheless…the other [Depth Captain] was pulling back, but she was no doubt making the same calculation Therrium was. Was it &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt; the risk of following this ship underwater? Spending time and thus, food and coin on a worthless endeavor?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium held the course. But…it was a funny thing. Wil Kallinad didn't know it, but more than one person was hoping for his success. And waiting for that moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romance, Duels, and Slugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Again, as was his wont, the Professor refused to say if Wil would get a different reward if he turned up empty-handed after his trip. But the other students opined that it was the Titan's way of saying 'yes'. Also, they'd received [Messages], letters, really, from Marian, Cameral, Umina—even Kissilt and the others about how the Professor had shared the [Message] in class and immediately begun a lecture on naval tactics in response to Venaz' allegations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was a good moment. But it didn't last. Soon—monotony set in. Only—this time the students knew their enemy. And one of them—Merrik—decided he was ill. He had cabin-fever. Sea-fever. Boredom-fever. And the only cure was sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alright. So, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; I get lucky, here's how we'll do it. I'll hang my helmet on the doorknob, like so. That means I'm busy. Don't come in. Bunk with someone else, got it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf was showing Peki the symbol they would use. She had the top bunk and he had the bottom in their room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola was paired with Feshi. Venaz with Wil. Peki was with Merrik, but the two didn't mind the gender difference. They were friends from Niers' officer training classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki eyed the thick, plate helmet that Merrik wore, forged from his home's forges. It wasn't enchanted, but his hammer and mail were lightweight. &lt;em&gt;Strong&lt;/em&gt;. Stronger than regular steel and made by experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you understand, Peki? I don't want you barging in and ruining the mood."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik shook the helmet at the Garuda. The bird-girl tilted her head sideways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Okay. &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; going to see if Feshi's interested in anything."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf smoothed his beard with some beard oil. He'd already cleaned the salt from it, and his clothing. Peki smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She said she's not into Dwarves."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, she just said she wasn't interested in visiting Dwarfhome. There's a difference. Besides…we're all cramped up on the boat. What's the harm in offering, eh? And she's smart. That thing with the Professor? I respect that. Who're you after? Venaz? Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Eh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda made a face. Merrik chortled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A [Lord] and Sir Bull himself. I don't fancy your options. But here—say you do get lucky. What's your signal? Worse comes to worst, we'll pair off in the other's rooms and sort it out. But I doubt we'll both do fine. Because I'm charming and you're a bird-brain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki ignored the jibe. She plucked Merrik's helmet from his other hand and smiled at him. When he looked at her, she pointed at the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If I get lucky, I'll use your helmet to let you know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two stared at each other, and then laughed. In a good humor, they trooped upstairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…So, Pheislant is a coastal nation. We're known for it. We're not as big as some of Terandria's larger kingdoms—which is why we'll probably do something if Ailendamus pushes at Calanfer and the other nations. They can't be allowed to continue expanding."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But do you have the forces to resist an attack?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At sea we'll do well. But Pheislant has a weaker land army. We don't profit by wars like the Minotaurs, Venaz. We have lighthouses, you know?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Famous ship-guides, I know. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been on a vessel before."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So you say, sir. Repeatedly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc and his [First Mate], Delivan, chortled. They were having a cordial drink with some of the [Strategists] and Lasc had lent the students his cabin. Actually—they were having a miniature lesson there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So this is the sextant? And you're plotting us by—what was it? Tacking the sails?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra was looking at the map. Lasc nodded. He had a compass, a sextant, and any number of tools for navigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aye, Miss Yerranola. We move zig-zag, see? By the wind. If worst comes to it, we'll use a spell or call upon a [Mage] or Skill to boost our sails. But we use the wind normally."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And we plot our course by the stars and the moons. Both of 'em. It's a Djinni's riddle, to do it. But any [Captain] worth his salt learns the trade."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan put in, grinning as he showed the other students how to calculate their course. Wil and the others were suitably impressed as the officers entered. Peki and Merrik hadn't joined in the little lesson, reminiscent of their classes. But then—they wouldn't even need to do this sort of thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, there you all are! How's it going? Dead gods, but I thought we left the book learning in Baleros!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In a good mood, Merrik strode over to the table. The others looked at him. Yerranola winked; she had a good intuition for this sort of thing. Feshi sniffed the air and Wil and Venaz turned from a debate over Pheislant's land forces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey Merrik, Peki. Come to join in the learning?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik kicked Peki under the table. Peki being Peki, she kicked back. Merrik muffled an oath as his eyes watered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—I can't say I'll ever captain a ship. Leave that to the experts like Lasc here. But I can respect Wil and the rest for learning to send ships across the ocean! Say, Feshi. You wouldn't mind teaching me some of the logistical side of things, would you? Never hurts to know more. And I'm—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The female Gnoll smiled at Merrik across the table, baring her teeth slightly. Merrik paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What, not even a few lessons? I was hoping—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. I'm not interested, Merrik."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf's face went flat. The others looked at each other. Venaz raised his eyebrows, looking hugely entertained. Merrik spluttered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wasn't insinuating—I was just asking—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll [Strategist] gave Merrik a look and he shut up. She held up a few fingers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Firstly, you've washed and you've oiled your beard. Second, I can smell you. And &lt;em&gt;third—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf deflated. Peki was smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi gave him a grin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've heard people trying that before. I'm not an idiot. Sorry, Merrik. But no thank you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others laughed. Merrik turned red, but he laughed along good-naturedly too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn! Well, there goes my options!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? With this pristine body here? I'm only slightly rotted—oh wait. This is my wrong body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra sniffed at her slightly decomposing flesh. She glanced quickly at Peki. The Garuda was &lt;em&gt;staring&lt;/em&gt; at Wil and Venaz. They shuffled their feet. Peki was very unsubtle. It was one of her flaws as a [Commander], actually. Then she started staring at Lasc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] grinned. But he turned to Merrik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, sir. Heard you and your lot were going stir-crazy below decks. Happens to all first-timers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Rejected.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki whispered. Merrik's rueful laughter cut off. He turned and growled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's it! I've had enough of you, you giant chicken! Upstairs! We'll settle this, once and for all!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki grinned. The two shot out of the cabin. Slightly worried, the other students and the two [Sailors] stared after them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;By the time they got upstairs, the fight was underway. Sailors looked up from their tasks as the Dwarf and Garuda strode to a clear patch of deck. Merrik had grabbed his helmet and armor and he was donning them fast as he could. Peki, being Peki, was helping him. As Wil got above decks she leapt back, and then &lt;em&gt;kicked&lt;/em&gt; across the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You blasted bird!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik raised a shield. The Garuda struck it and the impact and &lt;em&gt;crash&lt;/em&gt; of sound made everyone turn. Merrik barely moved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf had a shield and in his plate armor he was like a rock on the deck. Peki darted right and left, lunging forwards to attack in a flurry of blows, but Merrik let the impacts rain on his armor and blocked with his shield. He lashed out with his hammer, but Peki was far too fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You'll never break my guard, Peki!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you're slow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda flew up and &lt;em&gt;dropped&lt;/em&gt; in an axe kick. Merrik swore as he blocked. The impact &lt;em&gt;cracked&lt;/em&gt; the deck. The Dwarf swore, as he raised his hammer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You've tried that in training! Take this! &lt;em&gt;[Giant's Hammer—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lower your weapons and stop fighting on my ship or I'll throw your guts overboard and the rest of you with it!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc bellowed as he advanced on the two fighters. Peki hesitated and Merrik turned. Both stared at the broken planks on the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Uh oh."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki alighted and stood behind Merrik. The Dwarf pushed his helmet up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Er, sorry about that, Captain Lasc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain, Kallinad will repay you for the damages."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil looked at the furious [Captain] and waved his hands at Peki. She waved her wings back, looking only slightly apologetic. Lasc calmed down, but only slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No fighting on my deck, &lt;em&gt;sir.&lt;/em&gt; Miss. I've no objection to training with arms, but not of that sort!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But that's the only way we know how to fight! Mind you, I&lt;em&gt; am&lt;/em&gt; sorry. Peki—she doesn't hold back. Good on you that the deck's secure—I saw her kick straight through the roof of a house and into the ground floor with that trick, once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] glared, but then, surprisingly, relented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, it's just a bit of damage. But &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet's&lt;/em&gt; hull isn't made from ironwood! Or enchanted, beyond a few basics on the hull! But I've seen Miss Peki fight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Where?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik pushed up his helmet even further. It was First Mate Delivan who replied with a grin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Daquin, of course! We saw the entire thing! You're not the only one with scrying orbs. And it was good to see someone kick the Iron Vanguard in the teeth! Bastards rule Baleros' waters with a fist like…iron!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Sailors] laughed. Bemused, the students realized they were known. And—the ice broken, even Captain Lasc acknowledged having seen Peki and Merrik in action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was part of the reason we took this charter. Seeing Lord Kallinad duel with Tulm the Mithril, well, we hoped this would be a similar story. But it's good enough to see. And if you can split the deck with a single kick—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Stay away from the fucking boom!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice among the [Sailors]. Inky. The others laughed. Peki looked actually embarrassed and hid her face behind a wing. The [Martial Artist] could weather near-drowning, boredom, and Merrik better than embarrassment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, if I avoid striking the deck and Peki avoids hitting me from above, we'd have no problems. And sparring's not a bad idea. Helps with the rejection."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik gave Feshi a mock-heartbroken look. The Gnoll laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's still trying. Does he have a chance?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil whispered to Yerra. The Selphid grinned as she slung an arm around his shoulders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil, my boy, there's always a chance. Especially with Dwarves. Stubborn, like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Across the deck, some of the other crew of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; were taking advantage of the conversation about Daquin to test Merrik and Peki, minor celebrities. It was Delivan who spoke while casually patting his side. He had a sword and a miniature crossbow at his sides.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, [Storm Sailors] fight as well as any landfolk in their armies. We're the vanguard of the sea, but we don't truck with shields or armor. Can't swim if you get tossed. And a moving ship's not as easy to fight on as &lt;em&gt;dry ground. &lt;/em&gt;Mind if I give your armor a try, Mister Merrik?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Sailors] laughed and cheered. The Dwarf and Peki looked around at the challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I never turn down the chance to learn."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik grinned beneath his helmet. But it was Captain Lasc himself who stepped between Delivan and the Dwarf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If it's a challenge, I'll be the first to take it on. After all—a [Storm Captain] shouldn't fall behind a student. Even the Titan of Baleros's students."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The gathered crowd fell silent for a moment. Then there was a low murmur. The [Sailors] looked at Lasc. And they were…expectant as they glanced at Merrik and Peki. Appraising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil Kallinad felt his spine tingling. &lt;em&gt;[Storm Captain].&lt;/em&gt; That was, to his knowledge, at least a Level 30 class. But the students were high-level. He saw Merrik pause, and grin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can't be sure I'd spare your decks if I went up against you, Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, that happens in a ship battle. Can't help it if it's a true engagement. But we try to end it before it comes to that, right, crew?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc looked around. The [Sailors] laughed and cheered. Merrik's eyes narrowed. Wil was hesitating. &lt;em&gt;Should he break this up?&lt;/em&gt; He didn't know Lasc's class or abilities or temperament. He could…probably hold back. But he had a sword in one hand. Shortsword. Was he just some kind of good [Swordsman]?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then—a &lt;em&gt;snort&lt;/em&gt; from the side. And like he was born for the role, Venaz spoke up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's a lot of bravado. But I'm not sure Merrik's the best fighter among us. Or Peki, for that matter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Every head turned. Wil leaned on Yerranola and covered his eyes for a second. The Minotaur strode forwards. He was, of course, the tallest person on the ship bar none. Huge, hugely muscular, his fur rippling with muscle. He looked at Merrik and Peki. Both [Officers] eyed him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz, I love you like…a friend. Whom I've gotten to know for a few months at most. Two months, really. But you do like to talk out of your ass, right, Peki?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All ass, no Skill. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; are [Warriors]. You're a [Strategist]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt; A [War Strategist].&lt;/em&gt; I earned my levels, even if not all of my Skills went to combat. I consolidated my class. I've led [Soldiers] into battle. I didn't join the officer classes because I heard the acumen of the [Strategist] classes was better, and that was what I needed to work on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz flexed one arm, casually. Wil recalled—Venaz used plate armor too. He'd brought some for the trip. Also—he was skilled with any number of weapons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, really? And you think you could take me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik put his hammer down with deceptive good-nature. But even he had his limits. Venaz eyed him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You've got armor. Give me a moment to put on my armor and I'll take you on. Bastard sword, shield. Since it's not to the death, we'll call each blow a point. Mortal wounds or ten to a victor, fair?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur was smiling confidently. Merrik's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're overconfident, Venaz. Just because you have a few Skills, you think you can take me on? Fine. Let's do it and bet some &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; gold on—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc walked between the two. The [Storm Captain] had a casual stroll. But he put one arm out to block Merrik. And he looked at Venaz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mister Venaz. As much as I'd like the duel, I believe it was I who made the challenge. And the [Captain]'s honor must come before a passenger's. Even a paying one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur blinked. He looked at Lasc. Then he grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pull out your armor, then, Captain. I don't have a set large enough for you, but take out whatever you bring for a fight. Same rules—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll fight bare blade and as I am. A [Captain]'s dress. And for you, sir, I'll let you put on plate and whatever armor you feel's fitting. I'm confident enough not cut you. Say you touch me once—we'll call it your victory."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur—&lt;em&gt;froze&lt;/em&gt;. And Wil heard Feshi laugh with delight. Peki was grinning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You think you can take me down without a scratch?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's my ship, and we're at sea, sir. I'd dare any man or woman on this ship the same."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a &lt;em&gt;look &lt;/em&gt;in Lasc's eye, like a predator. And Venaz? He looked into that confident face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he lost his temper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil Kallinad had seen Venaz lose his temper a few times. When he'd broken the other Minotaur's jaw in the battle with the Iron Vanguard. In a pub brawl. In class with Marian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur's eyes would turn red. He would lose all sense of control—but not reason. When a Minotaur raged, it was like a Selphid's rampage. They were stronger, faster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Wil was worried about the outcome. Lasc was getting ready, but he hadn't done much other than draw his sword and put something on his left hand. On the other hand—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was in his plate armor, holding a sword and shield. He had a small armory in his bag of holding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz, you can't injure Lasc. Or make him lose too much face in front of his crew. A [Storm Captain] relies on it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I should let him insult me in front of everyone? Don't worry. I'll just draw blood."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Venaz's eyes were reddened with blood. Lasc calmly watched him stalk towards the circle of crew. Wil hurried over to Lasc and Delivan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain, Venaz cannot be injured or wounded in any serious way. And he is angered. If you could call this off—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Call off a duel I started, Lord Kallinad? I'd be laughed off the waves for that. Don't you worry. I don't need to bleed the Minotaur dry. Although it would be easy enough. This'll be a quick bout. Don't you worry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc strode forwards. Venaz was gritting his teeth as he raised his sword and shield, taking a defensive guard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No playing for points. A proper duel! No one kills the other, but all's fair before that. We both have healing potions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that how land men do it? Fair enough. Until the other falls or surrenders."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc grinned. Wil whirled to Delivan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can't you stop him?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry, Lord Kallinad. You paid for a true [Storm Captain] and his crew, sure enough. We've fought more than one invader off. Monsters, [Pirates]—any number of threats at sea landfolk have never dreamed of in their darkest. Captain Lasc—he's not going to lose, even to those two."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan nodded to Peki and Merrik, who were betting copious amounts of hypothetical gold on the outcome. Merrik, for all his anger, was backing Venaz. Peki, Lasc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you sure, Mister Delivan? Because this could be a serious matter if it goes poorly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] looked calmly at Wil. So calmly, the young [Lord] calmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad. There's no way Lasc'll lose. You don't know how he fights. Neither does that Minotaur."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was studying Lasc. The [Storm Captain] hadn't put on armor, but his rather swanky [Captain]'s uniform was pretty good. Also—enchanted, at least against salt and other minor annoyances at sea. However…Venaz had a sword and a Minotaur's strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All Lasc had was a shortsword. And—something on his hand. Metal? Venaz narrowed his eyes. What fighting style was this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Last chance, &lt;em&gt;Captain.&lt;/em&gt; If you're not ready?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If you're turning tail, Mister Venaz, no one'll stop you. Otherwise—start as you please. And I'll show you why the continental nations don't rule these seas."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc grinned. And Venaz, temper already at the breaking point, charged. If he was calmer he might have appraised. But he came in with a slash at Lasc's arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. Wil, who had taken a noble's fighting lessons, would have been disarmed literally by the blow. Even the [Sailors] winced. Venaz &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;a Minotaur who'd seen battle. And his blow was fast, strong—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc moved. The air rang with a sound and Venaz recoiled. He stumbled back. And Wil—stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On his hand. The bit of metal on [Storm Captain]'s left hand was neither buckler nor dagger. It was just—or rather, it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a gauntlet. A—glove. Made of metal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With his right hand, Lasc had parried Venaz' strike with the shortsword. With his left, he'd &lt;em&gt;belted&lt;/em&gt; Venaz across the face. Twice. So fast the Minotaur hadn't been able to pull his head back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dead gods!&lt;/em&gt; That was quick!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola exclaimed from the side. Venaz recoiled. He narrowed his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's an infighter's trick. You wouldn't be able to block an axe with that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd dodge that. Shall I come, Mister Venaz?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur didn't reply. But the crimson in his eyes grew deeper. He advanced, his shield raised to cover his face. The one unguarded spot on his body. He had plate armor. And his sword lanced out, quick as a snake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick!&lt;/em&gt; But Lasc was faster. Again, Wil saw his shortsword parry Venaz' thrust. And his left hand moved like a blur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had a faster hand-speed than any [Warrior] that Wil Kallinad had ever seen. And he had watched his sister sparring her peers in the Order of Seasons. But the [Storm Captain], unburdened of armor or anything but that metal fist, was faster yet. He hammered Venaz's shield, smacking the back of it into the Minotaur's face to disorient him. And then he dodged around as Venaz struck out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur was too tall for Lasc to easily hit his head. So the [Storm Captain] &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt;. Venaz whirled. This time, his sword just went straight for Lasc's legs as the man leapt. The fastest blow yet, just to cut, to slow the man down—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc's hand blurred. It was definitely a Skill. He struck Venaz twenty times before he landed. According to Peki. Helmet, neck, jaw—and his arm. Venaz' sword &lt;em&gt;sliced&lt;/em&gt; into the wood of the deck as it was deflected. He rocked. But he kept his guard up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] advanced. His left hand hit the Minotaur's chest, chin, head, arms—it was like hearing an endless ringing sound. The blows weren't light, either. Venaz stumbled back. He was trying to keep his guard up, trying to keep on his feet. But it was a flurry, a rush. He tried, but his shield was blown back and he stumbled for just a second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the [Storm Captain] danced, and his fist laid the Minotaur flat. Wil saw Venaz go backwards onto the deck. He waited, but Venaz' eyes were rolled back in his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Unconscious. The [Sailors] and students burst into a roar of amazement. Lasc raised his one hand. Delivan looked at Wil and grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Storm Captains], Lord Kallinad. He can't march with your [Knights]. But on the sea? Armor just makes you sink faster."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;When Venaz woke up, even he had to admit that Lasc deserved his title. The Minotaur had something to say, though; he always did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If I'd known I was up against a [Brawler], I'd have kept my distance. My strategy was sound. But—er—hrm. That's a difficult summit to beat without Skills and enchanted equipment. Even for me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was as good as saying he'd lost outright. Lasc was gracious about it, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, I had you by surprise, sir. I've seen Minotaur crews. Nasty as they come, especially with their ship-mounted weapons. But I'm fair fast with my fists."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Beyond fast! Can you do that, Peki?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trying."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki was competing with Lasc, but even her best flurry was slower than the [Storm Captain]'s. He was indeed just incredibly fast with his left hand. And he'd turned that one trait into an overwhelming advantage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;After that, there were no more duels between Lasc, although Merrik did take on a few [Storm Sailors]. They were all &lt;em&gt;quick&lt;/em&gt;. And Delivan had a nastily precise aim with the hand-crossbow he carried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wands and crossbows. That's how [Sailors] fight. We need to be nimble. It's all movement and clashing and retreat. Can't lug around heavy gear. And trouble can come quick."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sailors] were good, although Merrik and Peki were generally better. Although—they kept eying Lasc. And he them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd have more trouble taking down your armor, Mister Merrik. But I'll spare my ship's deck a refit. Myself—I think it'd be an interesting match if we went head-to-head. But if we were at sea, it'd be an easy one. Even against Miss Peki."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How so?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf looked wounded by Lasc's appraisal. The [Storm Captain] grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Against either of you? I'd dump you in the sea and let the water do the rest! No sense fighting folks who can't swim, in armor or with feathers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two officers exchanged a look. Then they laughed. They had to respect that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That night, Venaz was still nursing a sore jaw as they ate. He refused the healing potion, though, and an exasperated Yerra gave him the option of using a bit of potion or shutting up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not whining."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, but you &lt;em&gt;wince&lt;/em&gt; loud enough to make &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; jaw hurt. And my body's nerves are rotten!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra scowled. But Wil was relieved and looking forwards to tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll be ready to dive again tomorrow. The next wreck isn't far and Lasc has a ship-speed Skill."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hopefully it's something. But not a bad day."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was far from exuberant, but he seemed relaxed after having been beaten in a spar—and then having smacked down six sailors in bare-knuckles fights. With one arm. The others nodded and they had what was for them, an early night. No late-night drinking and debates. Just rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rest, and…Wil listened to Venaz snorting below him. Snorting, snoring, and smacking his lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz did not sleep lightly. The [Lord] hunted around for some sealing wax he'd shaped into earplugs out of desperation, but they were &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;. He hoped Merrik hadn't stolen them; he complained of the exact same problem with Peki. Only, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; whistled in her sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn you, Merrik—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil was getting off the top bunk stealthily, to creep into Merrik's room and see if he had purloined the earplugs. He was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; creeping out into the corridor when he heard the sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone was humming a song. Wil paused, and then went above decks. He found a dark ship, [Sailors] on deck of course; it was never a ship without dozens upon dozens of crew working. But relatively less occupied. And there—close to the passenger's quarters was her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailor] was sitting on the rails, one leg over, watching the ocean. Wil stared at her. And then he heard her stop humming. She turned her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bothering you, am I, Lord Passenger Kallinad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her tone wasn't &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; rude, but it wasn't friendly either. Wil winced, although he had no idea how she'd sensed him; the waves were an ever-present backdrop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, sorry. I have a snoring Minotaur and I couldn't sleep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailor] grinned. And when she spoke, he saw the inner &lt;em&gt;beak&lt;/em&gt; moving in her mouth. It was dopplering her voice a bit, but it didn't seem to bother her much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aye, that one. We can hear him too. Loud as a storm. But the [Captain] probably has some wax you can stuff your ears with."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I tried that. I think Merrik—the Dwarf stole mine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, another common issue at sea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The part Drowned-Woman nodded. She didn't move as Wil came over to the railing. She eyed him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So. Curious are you about Drowned Folk? Could've asked me. I take no offense, but for idiots damaging the ship."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil choked. He glanced at Inky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—heard?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Begal told me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He &lt;em&gt;did? &lt;/em&gt;Wil's expression must have given him away, because Inky laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What'd he say to you? That Drowned Folk and [Sailors] don't mix? True enough. But he didn't tell you that when it comes to it, we'll both drink from each other's cups rather than let landfolk get the drop on us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And here they thought they'd been clever. Wil sighed. But Inky didn't seem displeased. She glanced at him as he leaned on the rails.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. We didn't mean to offend you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, well. I admit, you're not as bad as I thought."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? How so?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The first thing I was thinkin' when I heard you were asking about me was which one of you it'd be. The Selphid? Not likely from how she acted, thought I. She likes you. The Gnoll don't seem interested and it's a rare landgirl who admits to liking women. The Garuda? Nope. So it was you, the Minotaur, or the Dwarf. I had odds on him or you being the gallant [Lord] who'd be kind to a half-breed like me. Invite me to your bed, sweep me off my feet. Marry me if I was lucky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She winked at Wil. The [Lord] said nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You might've lost your jaw on the decks, there, &lt;em&gt;sir.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why do you think &lt;em&gt;I'd&lt;/em&gt; do that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil turned red. Embarrassed because she'd struck closer to home than he'd liked, even if he hadn't been thinking of taking her to bed. Inky laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why, because that's how my ma had &lt;em&gt;me.&lt;/em&gt; And Drowned Folk are an exotic fling for our passengers. We carry all sorts of noble folk. And they're all too willing to try things at sea they'd never on land. But it's a double blue moon before any of them take it further."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil halted on the sentence. He glanced at Inky and her look. And he didn't say he was &lt;em&gt;sorry&lt;/em&gt;. Because he had nothing to be sorry about. And there wasn't much judgment in her gaze, anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, an odd sort. The Titan's students &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; different. And here I was, wooing you. All you had to do was say you were sorry and I'd have given it a shot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grinned. She had two gold-capped teeth. Wil jumped. He stared at Inky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Now you're teasing me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who, me? I was being serious there. Not often you get to snag a [Lord]. And Kallinad's folk would mean you got to go back to the sea now and then. Mind you—I like that idiot better."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Which one of my idiots?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Minotaur. He's brash as can be. Wouldn't be if he was one of the Minotaur crews. The seas beat that out of you. But—you landfolk're alright. Invite me to your table. Captain Lasc doesn't have enough work to keep me from it. And I'll happily spin you all the yarns you want if you ply me with enough drink."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was—friendly. Wil found himself smiling. His impression of Inky from her shouting at Peki was all wrong. But that was often how to happened. Wasn't that what the Professor said?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Try not to let your first impressions shape what you believe to be true. Or rather—understand that they do and compensate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Smart words."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Titan of Baleros said them, once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, he'd be the one. You're not bad, young [Lord]. I had the wrong impression of you. But you're still landfolk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The comment made Wil look up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Am I doing something wrong?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The part-Octopus girl laughed. She looked at Wil and shook her head in amazement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. But all landfolk do it. Look at you. You've been at sea, what, three weeks? And you're still mad. Cooped up. And you don't &lt;em&gt;see.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"See what? What is there to see?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky sighed. She dangled one leg over the railing and pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;There.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Wil looked. He stared over the edge of the boat. And he saw nothing but the ocean. But of course, that was what Inky was pointing at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was…dark. Like a black mirror, reflecting the stars and moons when they were out. But at times, they were just empty. And then—the vast, empty isolation struck you. The terror as you looked into the ocean and realized—you couldn't tell where the bottom was. You couldn't even guess.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was not a beautiful sight, except in the frightening aspect of it. Wil shivered. But—the allure of it called to him. He stared into vastness of the ocean. And wondered what would happen if he fell overboard. If Inky pushed him. What lay in the depths? How far would he swim, until he was exhausted? And float?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Forever. You could wander endlessly forever here. Without land in sight. Without any clue but for the stars where you were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So entranced was Wil that he didn't realize Inky was grinning at him until he looked up. And she nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's not beauty as landfolk understand it. It's terror. &lt;em&gt;The deeps.&lt;/em&gt; They call. They call to me and any [Sailor]. Look."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed down the railing. And Wil saw. More than one [Sailor] on duty was just staring. Consumed by the grand, terrible sight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And here I thought you liked the sea's beauty."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What beauty? This is it. The sea's as lovely as a blade. Without the danger—there'd be nothing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Woman smiled. The [Storm Sailor] looked into the horizon with a kind of longing. Fear and expectation. And Wil followed her gaze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;How deep? How &lt;em&gt;deep?&lt;/em&gt; What lay beneath? He remembered being a boy and wondering the same thoughts when he rode with his family on Kallinad ships. And he—understood. A bit of the fascination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sea.&lt;/em&gt; It stretched before him. But he could see nothing of what lay beneath the waves. Wil remembered. A vast, murky emptiness. Terrifying. And yet—there were other things too. He looked at Inky. And as he did, the water moved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At first, it looked just like the waters. A shimmering, giant mass of something on the hull. Wil stared at it, perplexed. The dark waters had birthed a cloudy, half-opaque…gelatinous thing. It had latched onto the hull. And it was moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, up the side of the ship. Wil stared at it. He saw two protruding things appearing. And then—light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Something like organs, lighting up inside the body. Two blob-like antennae. Glowing with interior light. Wil realized he was staring at a slug. It rolled up the side of the ship, surprisingly quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Oh, and it had a mouth. And in the mouth were rows and rows of rotating—&lt;em&gt;teeth?&lt;/em&gt; Wil saw the slug rear up as it went over the decks. It &lt;em&gt;lunged&lt;/em&gt; at him, coiling and expanding. Half again as large as—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Get back! Sea Slug!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky yanked him back. Wil fell backwards and felt a huge, slimy, &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt;, like filled water skin but far more massive crush his legs. He felt the pain, felt it &lt;em&gt;squirming&lt;/em&gt;. And then he felt reality come back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sound the alarm! We're under attack! Sound the alarm! Port-side! Sea Slugs!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky howled. She drew a cutlass and slashed twice. Her blade sank into the slug's body, scattering some of its fluids. But it was &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; and the blows seemed to do nothing. She dragged back Wil with one hand. He felt something—her suction cups—tightening on his skin, adding to her grip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then—her right, octopus-leg, tensed. Inky &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt; off the deck and jumped back with him. The slug undulated forwards. Wil scrambled back as shouting erupted from the front of the deck. Someone began to ring the bell. The slug opened its mouth and oozed forwards. Wil saw more glistening shapes appearing over the railing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sea Slugs! Where's the Captain!?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;All hands! Get up you idiots! GET UP HERE AND FIGHT!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky spat black ink towards the slug. It hit the gel antennae and the slug paused. But it tried to bite again. It was—&lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;! Not like a regular slug! The body was a lot more compact, and it moved like—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil reached for his sword. He drew it, shakily. He was no [Blademaster]. But he knew how to fight. His sword was enchanted and he circled left, slashing at the slug's side. He saw the tip of his sword open the thing's side. But like Inky's blade, it was just superficial. The slug was &lt;em&gt;thick&lt;/em&gt; and it's organs, while visible, weren't easily reachable. And—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It turned, biting. Wil saw the rotating jaw of teeth, jerked backwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stay back!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky shouted at him. She was slashing as she advanced, using her octopus leg to change her position quickly—it was far stronger than her Human leg and let her leap from spot to spot. Wil saw more [Sailors] fighting. He backed up and the slug came at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strike, strike&lt;/em&gt;—it was able to coil and lunge like a snake! Wil cursed. He reached for one of the expendable scrolls he didn't have. And he tripped backwards. The slug reared up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Slugs? &lt;em&gt;Damn.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik towed Wil back. A feathered shape exploded past Wil's head. Peki &lt;em&gt;kicked&lt;/em&gt; the slug back and Wil saw the huge body &lt;em&gt;smack&lt;/em&gt; across the deck. The [Martial Artist] landed and punched &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the slug's body. Wil saw her fists tear straight through the membrane. Peki yanked out a bundle of organs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ew."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all Wil could think to say. But the slug was still moving. It writhed, snapping at Peki. She shed the glistening innards as she dodged backwards. She kicked and punched it again, tearing out more organs. But it refused to die easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And more were coming. Dozens and &lt;em&gt;dozens&lt;/em&gt; of slugs were pouring over the sides of the ship. But &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was awake. Merrik grinned at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, Wil! Get behind us! Peki! Back up! &lt;em&gt;[Giant's Hammer]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He roared as he charged. Peki jumped back and for a second Merrik's hammer rose and fell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The deck shook. The slug &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; . Merrik turned, grimacing; he had the innards all over his body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grandfather's hammers! It's in my beard! Peki, did you hit the brain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thought I did. Kept moving."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Garuda complained. Wil staggered forwards. Then he shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Peki! Merrik! Behind you!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two turned. &lt;em&gt;Six&lt;/em&gt; slugs were crawling over the railings. Merrik swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. Wil, back up! We've got—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Starboard! Where's Captain Lasc?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky pointed. The students turned. Two dozen slugs had taken the railing and were flanking the [Sailors]. Wil stared about. They were being &lt;em&gt;flooded&lt;/em&gt; by the slugs! He saw a [Sailor] slashing with a sword, but he was outmatched. The slug fell on him and &lt;em&gt;bit—&lt;/em&gt;the man cried out, looking shocked as he tried to get away. Wil raced forwards, stabbing. He hit something in the slug's body but it refused to get off the man. Merrik and Peki were battling the ones around them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil! Watch your left!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] rolled just in time. A second slug dove at him. He saw more figures dashing on deck. A familiar bellowing voice roared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Clear the way!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz had his armor on. And this time he carried no sword and shield, but a battleaxe. He charged as the slugs oozed towards Wil. One reared up as the Minotaur, eyes glowing red, raised his axe with a roar of fury.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz swung horizontally towards the slug's midsection. He cleaved &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the organs, the body—the slug's torso fell to the ground, shaking. The Minotaur turned. He saw another slug, brought his axe down vertically and chopped through the slug, into the deck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Green hells! What are these things?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice from behind Wil. He saw Yerranola, armed with a glowing hatchet. Her blade was enchanted with fire and she hacked into the slug attacking the [Sailor], raising steam as she did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Get it off him!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi was behind Yerra. She had a shortbow and loosed an arrow into a slug. But it did nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz on the other hand—he saw the [Sailor], and punched &lt;em&gt;through &lt;/em&gt;the slug's body. He began ripping out the organs. Yerra copied him. Her thin arms &lt;em&gt;bulged&lt;/em&gt; and she and Venaz hurled the slug off the [Sailor].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man was alive. But his shoulder was a mass of blood and slime. Wil looked about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fuck all of this! They're hard to kill!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki was punching and kicking slugs as Merrik smashed slugs with his hammer. The Garuda whirled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Launch Kick]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hit a rearing slug. The entire frame of the monster flew over the railing. Merrik grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's the way! [Ram's Charge]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He smashed into another slug with his shoulder, blasting it into the railing. Peki jump-kicked it off the railing. But more kept coming up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's hurt. How bad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi was leaning over the injured [Sailor]. The man was gasping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can't feel a thing. I don't feel—it bit me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was staring at them, in shock. The [Strategists] turned as a voice roared from the prow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;All hands, repel these monsters! [Ship Spell: Floor of Impalement]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc pointed. A section of the deck erupted as huge, six-foot high spikes shot out of the wood. They impaled the slugs fighting the sailors there. The [Captain] whirled. His enchanted shortsword speared a slug through the stomach. His gauntleted fist flashed, tearing into the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Rallying Position]! [Attack Formation]! Don't let them surround you! Surround &lt;em&gt;them!&lt;/em&gt; Spells first, you idiots! &lt;em&gt;Spells!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was standing in front of the cabin. He'd replaced his crossbow for a wand and the [Sailors] were forming up around him. [Storm Sailors], like Inky were dueling the slugs while the lower-level ones pushed back in numbers, hacking the slugs apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But there were a lot of them. Wil looked around. Focus. He saw Feshi shouting, trying to pull the man belowdecks. Yes—but she'd lost focus of the battle. They were [Strategists]! Wil tried to find a way towards Delivan and Lasc. They needed his Skills!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yerra, help me get towards Lasc!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil pointed. The Selphid turned. She was looking around as Venaz finished off the slugs he'd bisected. Even in pieces, they kept moving until he hacked them up even further. Yerra looked at Wil and shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! Get below!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get belowdecks! &lt;/em&gt;Help Feshi! We'll send the wounded your way! Block the doors!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid pointed. Wil shouted back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What about you!? We're [Strategists]—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A hand grabbed Wil's shoulder. Merrik shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're [Commanders]! She's a &lt;em&gt;Selphid!&lt;/em&gt; Get below before we kick you down there! Use your Skills from afar—Venaz!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur wasn't listening. As Merrik and Yerra forced Wil and Feshi towards the belowdecks, the Minotaur raised his axe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;With me! &lt;/em&gt;Form up! You, you, &lt;em&gt;you! Now!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed to Inky, Merrik, and Peki as well as a dozen [Storm Sailors]. They looked at him and fell in. Venaz roared as they charged the largest group of slugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Unstoppable Advance]! [Enhanced Strength]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Battalion of Glory]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Fleetwind Feet]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik and Peki added their Skills to the mix. Wil saw the group's weapons glowing, and &lt;em&gt;accelerate—&lt;/em&gt;they hit the first slugs and the monsters exploded. Venaz and his team began hacking through the starboard side of the ship as Lasc saw and put his men to the port side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil! Below!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—fine! [Unit: Ram's Charge]! [Unit: Lucky Dodge]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Exasperated, unable to argue, Wil pointed. Venaz grunted as his group charged and &lt;em&gt;smashed&lt;/em&gt; another group of slugs. Another group of [Sailors] leapt back, avoiding the slugs with unnatural ability for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Instantaneous Reload]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi pointed at a group of [Sailors] with crossbows. Then she and Wil were dragging the sailor below. Yerranola took charge of the stairwell, calling [Sailors] around her and holding the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We should be above. Helping direct the battle—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil panted. The [Sailor] was asking how bad it was. Trying to move. Both Gnoll and Human told him to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; moving. He stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lasc has it. And there are enough [Strategists] above. The slugs stand no chance. Help me with him! He'll bleed out without help!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll &lt;em&gt;growled&lt;/em&gt; at Wil. Chastened, Wil reached for a potion. He stared at the [Sailor]'s wounds at last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A big chunk of his shoulder was &lt;em&gt;gone.&lt;/em&gt; Wil had seen injuries, but this was new on him. Countless micro-serrations from the giant slug's teeth. And—the healing potion &lt;em&gt;wasn't working right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I tried a potion. It didn't work. What do you feel?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi was feeling at the man's head. He was pale, sweating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I can't feel the bite. How bad is it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No pain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It itches."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two [Strategists] looked at each other. Wil's mind raced. Feshi turned to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Toxin of some kind."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Numbing. It's interfering with the healing, clearly. What about our antitoxin lessons?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll knew more about toxins than he did. Feshi thought, as above there was an explosion and shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hot water. We'll try washing it clean."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slime was covering the man's arm. As Wil found a pot and filled it with water, Feshi grabbed it. The Gnoll closed her eyes. The pot began to bubble at once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What the—&lt;em&gt;gah!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil burned his hand on the metal handle. It was &lt;em&gt;hot!&lt;/em&gt; He stared at Feshi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Shaman] class. Pour it on him!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The hot water began to move the mucus. As it did, the [Sailor] began to feel the pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dead gods&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kraken's teeth! My arm!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;It hurts, it—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hold still. We'll try healing you!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This time the potion did more. The numbing toxin was still getting in the way, but it wasn't as deadly as pure poison. Still—it made healing harder. Wil and Feshi stayed for a few more seconds. Then they raced abovedecks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;More [Sailors] were coming down, bitten, injured. But the entire ship was up and armed. Three hundred men and women, fighting. And the [Strategists]. And Lasc. He was triggering…spells? From his ship. And they were slaughtering the slugs; they weren't the highest caliber of monster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…The only problem was that they &lt;em&gt;kept coming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;We've killed at least a hundred of them! And they keep climbing on!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Move the damn ship! Wil! Feshi, I told you to stay back!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra shouted. A slug had eaten part of her leg, but she didn't even notice. Feshi aimed her bow left and right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Bursting Arrow]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pulled, loosed. Her arrow glowed. It sank into a slug's midsection and detonated. But two climbed up as the first one rained down. Wil stared at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was a &lt;em&gt;spell.&lt;/em&gt; [Shaman]? But the crisis was becoming apparent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was literally striding down the deck, hacking slugs in two. Merrik and Peki were smashing slugs with ease. But. They. Kept. Coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can't move the ship, Captain! We're caught in something!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was shouting as Wil and Feshi made their way down the center of the deck. The [Storm Captain] was looking around. His clothing was covered in slime and he'd downed a dozen slugs. But now he was frowning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The damn things are in the water. There might be &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt;. Captain, they'll sink the vessel!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] was looking worried. But Lasc was glancing around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get me Inky or that Garuda. Tell them to climb up and spot!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed up. Delivan whirled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Inky! The crow's nest!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Sailor] heard. She abandoned her fighting and ran as fast as she could with her ungainly gait towards the mast. She was slow on the ground. But she swarmed up using the suction cups on her hands—and feet. Wil saw her disappear upwards. He turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Rapid Retreat]! Pull back from that spot! Feshi, covering fire—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He began bellowing orders, taking charge of a group of [Sailors]. Lasc glanced at him, but let the two [Strategists] and Delivan command his men. He was staring over the sides of the ship. Searching. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky slid down from the crow's nest, shouting wildly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain! The port side! A hundred paces in the water! Pink glow!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ah.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain]'s eyes narrowed. He strode over to the wheel and turned. The boom moved. The ship turned—slowly—laboriously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain? What is it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc's teeth were bared. He was taking the ship, wrestling it—and moving it towards something. A glow in the water. He shouted as Inky moved towards him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're not being attacked by &lt;em&gt;slugs&lt;/em&gt;, Lord Kallinad! This—they're all connected! Separate parts of a whole. We're fighting—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pulled the boat forwards and Wil saw. A floating, glowing…&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; in the water. Vast, as vast as the ship. But it was submerged in the same clear substance. Wil stared. And then he realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was staring at a brain. A brain the size of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. And he saw the slugs coming over the side and realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A &lt;em&gt;jellyfish?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi's eyes went round. The Captain nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're just pieces of the body. We won't kill it's body nor escape before it takes us down. Not without taking the brain out. &lt;em&gt;Inky, Delivan! Forty [Storm Sailors]! &lt;/em&gt;Prepare to go overboard on my mark!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Into the waters? They'll be slaughtered! Even with our Skills, Captain—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil stared at the churning water, filled with slugs that were climbing up. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;em&gt;groaning&lt;/em&gt;, trying to float with the added weight. Lasc's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;On my order! Lord Kallinad, this is my ship! [Storm Sailors]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They came running. The [Captain] pointed. Wil saw his eyes flash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Ship Spell: Depth Explosion].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed. Wil saw the sides of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; flash. Something coalesced in the water. And the pink, floating brain &lt;em&gt;detonated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The glistening body erupted in a fountain that sent water and slimy guts raining down. Wil threw up his hands. What was &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt; A Tier 5 spell!? Was that a &lt;em&gt;Skill?&lt;/em&gt; He saw Lasc staring into the waters. And as they cleared—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The brain was damaged. Parts had been torn away by the blast. But the core remained. The slugs shuddered, moved slower, but they still came on. And yet—the protective layers of the jellyfish were gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Now, Captain Lasc roared. He strode down the deck as the [Sailors] fought twice as hard, shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Storm Sailors]! Into the water! Damn this beast back into the abyss!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky and the veterans roared. They charged the railing and leapt. Into the sea, filled with the jellyfish's tendrils. Wil looked over the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Unit: Tough Skin]! Will they survive?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He turned. Delivan was nodding. He pointed a wand, hit a slug in the head with a bolt of fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry, Lord Kallinad. They'll make it. Those are the sea's best."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And indeed—the [Storm Sailors] were fighting in the water. Most had enchanted weapons. And they were carving straight for the jellyfish's brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil saw one of them go under, sucked down by a slug. Another reached the brain and was covered by slugs. Two down. But then—Inky was standing &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the brain. Diving into the waters and hacking into the pink head. The other [Storm Sailors] joined her. They cut, mercilessly ripping the jellyfish apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The slugs swarmed back over the railing, trying to protect their true self. Too late. Even as the last ones tried to plop over the railing, they slowed. Grew…aimless. They flopped down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Dead. The [Storm Sailors] kept cutting until all that was left was floating pieces and gore in the waters. Then they returned to the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three didn't come back. But thirty-seven, some wounded, most intact, had done it. The [Sailors] cheered. The students, panting, Merrik, Peki, and Venaz covered in jellyfish guts, saw the [Sailors] returning. Captain Lasc saluted them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Storm Sailors]! &lt;/em&gt;Sea's honor to you all! And the bounty to you and the dead!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They raised their weapons and cheered. Victorious. Wil watched, panting. He felt—tired. But he'd barely fought, just tried to command. Saved one man's life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all. He felt—wrong. He should have done more. And Feshi's face clearly reflected the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was done. The [Captain] ordered kegs of alcohol breached. He toasted the dead, listing names. The [Sailors] drank. They slapped each other on the back, complimented Venaz and the two [Commanders], who had slaughtered the jellyfish. Even Wil and Feshi and Yerra, who'd helped with their Skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then? They got back to work. And yes—swabbing the deck was now mandatory. The jellyfish was dead, but it had to be removed from the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The worst damn part is that there's little to salvage. Maybe the brain, but we're not sticking around to gather it up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky was cursing as she tended to a few bites on her side. She glanced up as Wil and the other students approached. She grinned at Wil's face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fancy your first engagement at sea, Lord Kallinad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think I'd have preferred the boredom. That was…something."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An enemy that vast? No land-creature was that big. At least, none that Wil had seen. He stared into the ocean. A different scale of foe. He looked at Inky and stared at the dark waters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is it still good to look at the sea, Inky? Captain Lasc?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man heard him. And he and the other [Sailors] laughed as if it were the funniest thing they'd ever heard. So did Inky. Her teeth flashed as she pointed at the jellyfish they were leaving behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course! How else do you know what's sneaking up on you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasure and Angry Crabs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The next day, the ship felt different to Wil. Not as much a prison of boredom. More like…well, a kind of home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They'd fought for it. Protected it. And—Inky had shown him the sailor's secret.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sea. The students sat at their table and just watched as the ocean passed by. They didn't need games. They had conversation and—well, you could admire the ocean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Green and clear with the sun's rays shining through them. It was hypnotic beauty, one that could let you spend days and hours watching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too, the battle was fresh in their minds. And they were discussing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I feel like my entire strategy was flawed. Here I was, leading a vanguard down the decks when I should have been apprising the situation. Also—we weren't optimally fighting. We killed the slugs, but I didn't take into account the fact that they were weighing down the ship. I should have been keeping them from boarding. Mistake, and mistake, and mistake—I didn't even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the real threat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was self-critiquing his part of the battle. Which was funny—he was insufferably sure of himself, but in victory he never failed to give himself the hardest time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're not a trained sailor, Venaz. Even Delivan didn't realize it was the jellyfish. Lasc did. That's his &lt;em&gt;job. &lt;/em&gt;I didn't even do much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil grumbled. He was having a morning drink. He wasn't a drinker, but the sea was turning his blood alcoholic. The Minotaur shifted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even so, we have to be our best. And what if we'd had to take the fight into the water? I'm seeing more of my weaknesses. I should have studied more on underwater combat in the Isles of Minos."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But we could have helped better. We should have taken up a position to help manage the crew from the start, yes? We didn't even prepare for that. We should have coordinated with Lasc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi pointed out reasonably. Wil nodded. He glanced at Yerra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why did you tell us to get below, Yerra?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, the sailor was wounded. And you and Feshi aren't fighters, Wil. Not really."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Neither are you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man looked miffed. The Selphid grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; wearing a dead body. I don't take wounds like the rest of you. Merrik and Peki get a pass, but even Venaz should be more careful. He's good, but he's not exactly a [Warrior], right? Lasc proved that. You need to be careful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, but there's no safety in a ship battle, Miss Yerra. If the jellyfish had penetrated the hold, all those below decks would have been just as threatened. More, if the slugs came down the stairs. Nowhere to run."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That came from Inky. She was having a drink. The students had invited her to join them and the [Storm Sailor] was enjoying it. Lasc had granted the leave; the [Storm Sailors] were lounging about as the regular [Sailors] worked hard. The privileges of risking your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"True enough. But there is something to protecting [Strategists]. Remember Orthenon hacking apart Belchan's elites and their [Mages]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik put in. He and Peki were cleaning his armor. The jellyfish gunk was hard to get rid of. The Garuda nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lots of dead [Strategists]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other students glared at her. Yerra was raising her hands as she looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just trying to keep you safe, Wil. You only get one body. Be a shame for Kallinad's best [Lord] to get hurt!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil turned red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't say that. I hate being treated like…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A [Lord]? You shouldn't have been a [Strategist], then. Yerra's right. If we had to pull slugs off you, you'd have been a hindrance. You still used your Skills. Nice one—I wish I had [Lucky Dodge]. Commanders only get a few good battalion-wide Skills. We sacrifice a lot to be good fighters as well. But [Strategists] get lots. Still, you're fragile."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik could be remarkably blunt when he wanted to. Wil sighed. But that was that. Inky grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is this what being a student is? I could do that. Talking about tactics and whatnot while drinking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Professor doesn't let us drink in class. But we make up for it after class. You might enjoy it, Inky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Except for the time he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; let us drink. Remember? Kissilt was saying that it didn't matter? So he had us play games increasingly drunk?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The entire group shuddered as one. The Titan had made them &lt;em&gt;drink&lt;/em&gt;. And he'd proven with exacting detail how it impaired them as [Strategists] and how many [Soldiers] they lost due to sloppy mistakes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strategy is important. It's all too easy to come up with a winning strategy that relies on one element. But being adaptive? It's our job to come up with plans that can change an entire army's battle. However, even with all our training, amateurs can surprise even the best [Strategists]. We can always learn. And we should. Do you have any naval tactics you can share with us?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz sat back, looking at Inky. She grinned at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mister Sea Cow, you've come to the right place."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Sea Cow?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other students choked on their drinks. Venaz stared at Inky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I take objection to that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Go ahead and do that. And sit back while I spin you a yarn about a few situations I was in that were worse than that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a good way to pass the time. And Venaz, who was known as 'Sir Bull' behind his back, was given another name. Wil had almost forgotten the purpose of the trip or the fact that they were closing on the seventh shipwreck. But he realized when he saw the island in the distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Land ho!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone shouted from the crow's nest. The [Sailors] and students rushed to the railing, eager to see. The island was mostly a rocky bluff in the sea. Some underground mass of stone that had risen. Or an actual island eroded by time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, damn. Look at the rocks! No wonder the ship went down."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky exclaimed. Lasc instantly ordered the ship to slow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Delivan, you're steering. Take us close as you can. We'll row to the spot if need be."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aye, Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] gritted his teeth. He had a navigation Skill that helped him see underneath the boat. He moved them forwards slowly, adjusting the ship, swearing at the changing wind. Wil stared at the precipice of rock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't…&lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the boat."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;What he did see was some sand and an actual floor to the ocean—as well as the treacherous outcroppings of stone that could so easily shred a boat's hull. Inky peered into the waters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Might have fallen deeper. We'll have to dive. But hey—it could be this place wasn't picked clean. Although…wait…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed. The [Sailors] peered over the edge. Wil stared into the waters. They were very clear around here and he could see straight down. His heart leapt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Look! A ship!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It had been downed. The hull was cracked in two. But it was unmistakably a ship!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't see a diver's sign. Could be its hidden, but it would shine at us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky was staring down at it. Wil's heart leapt. He looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Prepare the diving bell. [Divers], get ready."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc was calm as could be. But he was smiling, having heard Inky's words. The other students were perking up. Yerra slid over to Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come on, [Strategist] Kallinad. Which wreck is this supposed to be?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well…I don't want to raise your expectations…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Wil!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man's heart was pounding. It even looked the right size. He took a breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alright. This &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be the site of a cargo ship. With cargo that was meant for…Archmage Zelkyr."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students and [Sailors] looked around. So did Lasc. Yerra's eyes went round.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way. Then…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone stared at the shipwreck. Delivan was looking about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're good if we hold here, Captain. Drop anchors?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. We'll search the wreck and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Storm Captain! Shipwreck off our aft starboard side!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone shouted. Begal waved and everyone turned to look. Wil stared and then rushed to the other side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; ship?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This one was torn to bits. Everyone stared at it. A submerged prow—a faded figurehead. Wil saw heads turning to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Was it a fleet meant for Archmage Zelkyr?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps. But the Professor said it was only one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. Maybe this place has been plundered. And that's a diving ship that hit the rocks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky cursed. Wil felt his heart sink. But the [Divers] were making ready. Two shipwrecks meant that there was twice as much to possibly find. They were preparing to go down, Inky among them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can you dive, Lord Kallinad?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I swim fairly well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] replied modestly; he was by far the best swimmer of the group. Inky grinned at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And you, Sir Sea Cow?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm beginning to think you're doing that on purpose, Miss Inky. I can hold my breath for six minutes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, perhaps you'll dive with me, you two. Once we make sure there's nothing lurking in the wreck—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky was teasing. And then—a voice from the crow's nest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain? I see another shipwreck. No…two shipwrecks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone stared up. Captain Lasc's head slowly turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Four shipwrecks?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He looked at Wil. The [Lord] felt a prickle run down his spine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That wasn't in the Professor's notes at all, Captain Lasc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] looked at him. And then he turned his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Delivan. Your [Dangersense]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not tickling. Yet. Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But it could be…take us away, Delivan."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Why?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra looked incredulous. Captain Lasc stared narrow-eyed at the small outcropping of rock, and then into the underwater mountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something's…off. We'll investigate from afar. I'll take volunteers. Away, Delivan. At least a few hundred feet and then—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something moved in the waters.&lt;/em&gt; Wil saw it. Everyone saw it. A shape crept around the side of the stone mountain. He froze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A gigantic shape breached the waters. A huge, armored leg pulled the creature upwards. Wil saw a huge eye, staring at him from a stalk. A chitinous body. Dark with algae and barnacles. And on its back—the hull of a ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A hermit crab. The size of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;, with a warship as its shell. Captain Lasc and the sailors stared as the crab's head breached the waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…That's a big crab."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki pointed calmly. Merrik swore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's got a ship on its &lt;em&gt;back! Grandfather's—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Take us back, Delivan! All hands! Prepare to maneuver!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's as large as we are! Are we going to fight?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain! &lt;em&gt;Captain!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc was hesitating. The crab was huge, and &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was turning. Wil tried to push forwards as the [Divers] flung off their gear. They were grabbing for harpoons, ranged weapons. The crab was moving forwards, massive pincers raised. It clearly saw…food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We don't need to tangle with that monster. We could try. My ship-spells are recharged. But I don't like the odds of it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain]'s magic came from his class and Skills. He aimed at the crab, appraising the fight. And then he saw Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain! Look!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] was white-faced. He was pointing. The [Captain] turned his head. And everyone saw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There, on the part of the ship that was the crab's shell. Something was glinting. The magical paint was worn. But—the name was still visible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Archmage's Favor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A ship's name. Delivan's eyes went round. Captain Lasc turned his head back. And he stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archmage Zelkyr's cargo.&lt;/em&gt; The [Storm Captain] thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If we maneuver, we'll keep out of range of that crab's claws. And if the cargo is there? Watch for any magical attacks, Delivan. Steer us out of range! We'll see how fast this crab is in the water!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aye, Captain!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] was turning the ship. The crab followed as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; shot away. The crew was cheering, aiming, waiting for the thing to get onto land. The crab was obliging them, climbing onto rock precipices after the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll have a hell of a time doing it, Captain! We can't shoot into the water!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'll wear it down. And I'll use [Depth Explosion] as soon as I can. If we must, [Storm Sailors] can climb onto it. Get around it and shred the monster where it can't fight back."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was conferring with the others. Venaz was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can boost them from afar. We have &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; students with Skills that can boost the [Storm Sailors]. If need be—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. The crab's slowing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra pointed. The crab was perched on top of the little island. It was just resting there, huge legs holding tight as it carried its huge burden out of the water. The [Sailors] began loosing shots, but they were too far to hit the monster properly and the few arrows that landed did nothing to the massive shell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Idiot thing. It's clearly not as smart as some of the monsters in the sea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan chortled. The others were nodding, and Lasc was frowning, trying to figure out if now was the time to hit it with a spell. But it was Feshi who looked concerned. She glanced left and right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait. Is that the thing that downed &lt;em&gt;The Archmage's Favor,&lt;/em&gt; or did it just pick up the ship?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil glanced at her. The Gnoll looked worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What does it matter, Feshi?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Strategist] eyed the giant crab. It was just standing there. Waiting. Expectantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If it downed the cargo ship, that was one thing. But what about the other ships that came after? If it did that—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at Feshi. And Wil—hesitated. He saw Lasc turning his head, suddenly, appraising the size of the shipwrecks on the ocean floor. He looked up sharply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Archmage's Favor&lt;/em&gt; and that ship are both twice our size. Delivan—take us back another—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As Wil looked at Lasc, something &lt;em&gt;flashed&lt;/em&gt; out of the corner of his eye. Then he heard a wumph.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No, a &lt;em&gt;wh—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Water on his face. &lt;em&gt;Rain? &lt;/em&gt;Wil heard ringing. Shouting voices. Someone was…someone was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Wil! Get below!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Turn the ship! Take us away! Get us out of range!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bellowing voices. Wil tried to raise his head. Yerra was dragging him. The ship was moving and people were shouting. What was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But the treasure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get us out of range! It's about to—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another explosion. This one from father off. More rain. Wil struggled upright. Yerranola was dragging him towards the quarters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get below! Out of danger! &lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's happening? What—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil got to his feet. He resisted the Selphid trying to move him down. And he saw—Venaz, Merrik, and Peki all standing at the railing. Holding their weapons, but just…staring. And in the distance, the crab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The hermit crab. With the broken warship on its back. Wil saw the holes in the hull. The gaping—broken warship's frame. But the light? The explosions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then he saw. A flash from the interior. For a second—a beam of golden light. It hit the water near &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; and the superheated water &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt;, geysering into a rain that fell on the ship. The galleon &lt;em&gt;rocked&lt;/em&gt;. And the crab shifted. Aiming the beam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's magic."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil said it dumbly as Yerra pulled at him. A spell. But where was it coming from? And then—as the light appeared again, he saw it for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A carven face. An eye made of a gemstone. A staring figure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Golem, buried in the hull.&lt;/em&gt; It was covered in barnacles, moss. Still secured by the bindings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's a damn war golem. But look at the &lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt; of it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It fired again. The magical beam of light missed—Delivan was turning the ship, zig-zagging away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Get out of range of that thing! It will tear through our decks, Skills or not!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc was bellowing, his face white with fear. Wil tried to struggle as Yerra dragged him down the steps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No! We have to go after it! That's a &lt;em&gt;Golem! That's—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stow it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik jumped down the steps. Peki, even Venaz was taking cover. The Dwarf looked at Wil as he pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That thing will destroy the ship in one go! That Golem is massive! It's probably designed to sack &lt;em&gt;cities!&lt;/em&gt; We can't fight it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But the treasure—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil whispered. The ship rocked as Lasc and Delivan took &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; away from the isle. Another near miss—and then—silence. Wil looked around. Yerra stared at him. Afraid, remorseful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry, Wil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some threats are too big to fight in the sea. You learn that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky spoke up from her cover. Wil Kallinad looked around. But it was &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. The golem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An Archmage's…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He closed his eyes, bitterly. Someone else would have to take it. A navy. Another hero. He let his head fall back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn it all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium of &lt;em&gt;The Passing Shadow&lt;/em&gt; had seen it all, of course. He'd let the jellyfish attack &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;—the [Storm Captain] had the resources to fight it off, even if he was an air-breather.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the crab? That had caught them off-guard. He stared from his remove as another beam pierced the waters. It didn't penetrate far, but the explosion was thunderous from under the sea. His crew, used to silence, clapped their hands or appendages over their ears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was leaving. Fast. The [Depth Captain] stared at the giant crab, which guarded the other wrecks and what was clearly a war golem. The half-Eel man eyed the monster, glanced at the other Drowned Ship waiting underwater next to him. The other [Captain] was staring at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two came to a same conclusion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They turned their ships. They'd mark the spot, but an armada would have to take the ship back from that damn crab. Some treasure wasn't worth the risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it burned in the memory of all who had seen it. A relic of Archmage Zelkyr. It was &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. Waiting to be claimed. Perhaps more. Was it better to have never seen it? Because it consumed the soul, like poison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kraken's Pass, Fog, Strange Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Upon reflection, we should have clearly taken measures for engaging giant monsters. Not that this ship isn't well-equipped. But as we've seen—perhaps a very defensive-oriented ship might have been able to close the gap. I hear some hulls can be stronger than steel."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, if you had the best [Captain] in the world and one of the most famous ships, perhaps. But Captain Lasc did right by us, Mister Sea Cow. And before you complain you did naught—there was nothing any of us could do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mood was somber after the encounter with the giant crab. It had been so sudden. So short. But they had seen it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Treasure. And yet—it was gone. The giant crab was too big, and the magical attack from the golem too terrible. Lasc had flatly refused to even go near the spot again. He had taken the ship in the direction of the eighth shipwreck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Wil was depressed. He sat as the others debated the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We know it's &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, though&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Can't we go back with like, uh, a magical deflecting shield or the right equipment? A stealth-rogue like Lady Foliana to deactivate the Golem? Dead gods! I'm sure the Professor would do it. What if we hired a fleet?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No good. And how do you propose &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; negotiate for it, Yerra?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik sighed. Venaz nodded as he poured a drink. The Selphid looked blank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We know where the crab is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. So you lot tell…who? Lord Seagrass himself? And he takes his armada, loses some warships and…what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky took the cup out of Merrik's hands. He'd been offering it to Wil. But the [Lord] didn't want to drink. Yerranola went on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right. And he gets the treasure…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And keeps it. Why would he share the bounty with us when he does all the hard work?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil spoke up flatly. Yerranola opened her mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, we have the location."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And? He's the one who has to do the fighting. Or the Professor. It doesn't matter anyways. We could sell it for…something. I'll do it tonight. Sell the location, rather."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, come on, Wil. Sell it? Negotiate—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"With &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil turned, looking angry. Yerra didn't understand. She waved at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're the only ones who know where the treasure is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Us. And Captain Lasc. And Delivan. And the entire crew of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;. Who probably already sent their own [Messages] to people telling them what they &lt;em&gt;saw.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra went silent as she digested this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. But…but they don't know &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; it is. Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky swished the drink in her mouth before swallowing. She looked sympathetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trouble is—Miss Yerra—that undersea mountain's too visible. If it were one of the older shipwrecks, I could see it being harder to locate. But this one's findable. Now—if there was no marker of any kind and you were trawling the sea bed unless you had the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; star-coordinates, that information would be worth something and perhaps only Lord Kallinad'd be able to sell it. Or Lasc, since he'd have a good idea where it was. But this? Too easy to say 'look for a mountain around hereabouts'."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She nodded at Wil. The [Lord] nodded glumly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't think we can even sell it for much. I'll…ask Lasc to make the next two shipwrecks harder to spot. He can play with the timing so we arrive by day and sail far away by the time it's nightfall. If there's anything worth finding, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That would help. With the other two shipwrecks. If they came &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; for a treasure. But the fact remained. That had been it. And it—was gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry. It was a sight to see, at least."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi spoke quietly from the bunk where she was sitting. The others nodded. Wil did too, after a moment. It was. He tried not to let the depression consume him. However—it was hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;To distract himself, Wil took issue with Yerranola. Mildly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yerra, you dragged me belowdecks. Again. And you told me and Feshi to take cover. We're not children. We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; [Strategists]. We can fight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah, but you're fragile. Venaz has his armor at least and Merrik and Peki are [Commanders]. And I'm—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Selphid."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone chorused. Yerra smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey, you know my line. Look, Wil. I'm just looking out for my favorite fleshfriend."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hugged him lightly. Wil sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I appreciate it. But we don't need to be overprotected, Yerra."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid disagreed, smiling, looking a bit concerned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But you're all my fleshfriends. I can't have one of you accidentally getting stabbed! Arrows through the head kill &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She elbowed Wil, laughing gently and tapped her skull. It made a slightly hollow sound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There's nothing up here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can say that again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz grumbled. Yerra threw his pillow at him. It stuck on his horns. The others laughed, relaxed—Wil smiled as he felt Yerra patting him on the shoulders. It was a cold, clammy touch. But she and he &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; friends, ever since she'd befriended him when they first entered the academy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet, Yerra's flaw was she &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; protective. Overly so. He straightened and spoke in a haughty tone. Half-mocking, half-serious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Miss Yerranola. We didn't join this adventure to stay below decks. We &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; fight. Stop ordering us to get below at every opportunity. You &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; tell us where to be safe if we're being idiots."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hesitated, and then ducked her head in an acknowledgement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh—fine. We'll let you fight. But you have to put &lt;em&gt;armor &lt;/em&gt;on. Wil, Feshi, do you even have any good enchanted gear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have armor!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi just shrugged as Wil retorted. Merrik rolled his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, do you ever put it on? Let's see it then. And let's see if you can even swing that longsword you carry about."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others chivvied Wil onto the deck. He found himself doing mock sparring with Merrik, who gently swatted his blade down and then forced Wil to try his best. They were helping cheer him up. And Wil appreciated that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And resented it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For about five days, the students were left to their own devices. Inky drifted in and out of their conversations as they discussed everything and anything &lt;em&gt;besides&lt;/em&gt; Zelkyr's lost ship—which was by now public knowledge. It had indeed been sold by members of the crew to anyone willing to buy the information and it was now worthless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc had apologized to Wil and assured him he'd take more precautions. From now on, the [Sailors] would have a harder time marking spots via the stars. And, barring any notable landmarks, it would discourage information trading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too little, too late. Only…two shipwrecks remained. And Wil was despondent, even if finding actual treasure had rekindled his dreams. It was just regret. If he had convinced the [Storm Sailors] to attack the crab from all sides, would they have triumphed? If he'd realized the threat, convinced Lasc, maybe? Maybe?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It would have risked the lives of everyone. But that was what you needed to do for treasure, right? It was right…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil might have moped forever, despite everyone's best attempts to cheer him up. But two things took his mind off the loss. And cheered him up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The first was the drama around Lord Bein and the [Couriers] on their run. That was &lt;em&gt;entertainment&lt;/em&gt;, and the [Strategists] had a good time watching and commentating. Feshi, an Izrilian, actually knew one of the Couriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mm. Hawk runs south of Liscor as well. That's a useful Skill."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Physical Overdrive]. Imagine if Peki had that. Or me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was clearly jealous. So was Peki.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good fighters. Wonder if I can beat them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're Couriers, Peki. The best Runners in Izril. Even for us, that's a hard sell. Dead gods, but I'd love to have them as irregulars under my command, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik was commentating. The others nodded. Wil was about to bring up some of Terandria's finest Runners—and mention that Salamani actually ran on Terandria now and then—he switched continents—when there was a cry from the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Starboard side! Something in the water!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone shot to their feet. By now, the students were in tune with the boat. Everyone checked for their weapons. Wil had some leather armor on. He could swim in it, and he had been pressured into wearing it at all times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Helmet—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra checked Wil as he ran. He scowled, but grabbed it. By the time he ran to the starboard bow, everyone was ready for trouble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But for once, the trouble wasn't there. Instead—the [Sailors] were laughing in delight. Even Inky was smiling and calling out to Lasc, who'd emerged from his cabin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No trouble, Captain! It's sea-friends!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? What are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then they pointed. And Wil saw a leaping shape nearly reaching as high as the deck. He saw an eye, a curved body and fin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Dolphins!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A pod of dolphins had swum alongside the ship. They were racing alongside the vessel, making clicking sounds, leaping, playing in the water. And the [Sailors] were laughing, finding bits of food to toss over the railing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ironically, it was Peki who hid behind Merrik. She squatted down, warily eying the dolphins. Merrik, Feshi, Yerra—none of them knew what the fish were and were confused. Inky laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dolphins! They're one of the smartest fish out there. Sailor's friends. No [Sailor] or [Fisherman]'ll hunt for them—only shorefolk and idiots do. They save folks who've gone overboard. As smart as they come!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Surely! They're playful! See?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dolphins were doing tricks, dancing in the water. One flipped past the boat and Peki emerged to stare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This pod was a mix. Some were blue to gray. But there were &lt;em&gt;pink&lt;/em&gt; dolphins in the water as well! Wil marveled at the sight. The colorful dolphins were smiling—or at least, that was how they felt to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So there's not just monsters in the sea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course not. Just the largest of them. If you'd been watching earlier, you'd have seen some fish. Mind you—dolphins are prey for a lot of the big ones, like that damn crab. But they can fight off sharks and they're smart enough to run."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Entranced, the [Strategists] watched. Then they realized—they could feed the dolphins! The fish were only too happy to eat some of the salted fish and other meats. Everyone was laughing and Venaz was actually opining to get into the ocean to see if they could touch the dolphins when something moved below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A vast shadow. Instantly, the crew reacted. But the dolphins kept playing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Another shape. And this one was—vast. Not as large as &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;, but far, far larger than a dolphin. Ten times as large. Wil froze, but Inky frowned and pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No danger! It's a Nelgaunt!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nelgaunt sighted!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others took up the call, relieved. Wil looked around. This he wasn't familiar with. He saw a huge fish surface. Like a catfish crossed with a whale. Only, it had long tendrils. And it was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Smiling. It had a shark-like hide, but a whale's strange, feathery 'teeth'. And it swam with the dolphins and they played about it, clearly relaxed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's a Nelgaunt? It's big!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Another friendly sort. Two sea-friends in one day! Although Nelgaunts often swim with dolphins. They eat small things in the water, and they only fight to defend themselves. It's one of the reasons they swim with fishes; they look out for each other. How else would you survive in the ocean against Reefeyes and worse?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky waved at the Nelgaunt. And to Wil's amazement, the Nelgaunt copied the motion with one of its tendril-arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It can &lt;em&gt;wave?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nelgaunts make dolphins look like idiots! It can wave—might even understand a few words. I've heard of ships partnering with Nelgaunts. Training 'em. Captain Lasc, thoughts?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Captain was looking into the waves. He saluted the Nelgaunt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If it were a baby alone, we might try feeding it, and taking it with us. But this one seems well enough. Let's call it good fortune, and not push our luck."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can we communicate with it in any way? This is incredible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi peered over the railing. She made a barking call towards the dolphins. They scattered, clearly astounded, and &lt;em&gt;clicked&lt;/em&gt; back. The Nelgaunt's reaction was even more astounding. It blew water out of its blowhole. A sound trying to imitate Feshi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra was amazed. She waved at the Nelgaunt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can you understand us? Blow twice for yes, once for no!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A pause. And then two toots of water shot out of the blowhole. The students and crew laughed in delight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone open the stocks! Toss the dolphins what they want! What do Nelgaunts eat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fish! Krill—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can they eat bread? What about rum?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Laughing, Begal poured some over the side. Inky immediately smacked him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Idiot! Don't poison them! And don't waste good drink!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil was trying to think of a question to ask the Nelgaunt. He called over the side as the giant catfish swam closer. It was staring up at him—it actually had another eye on its side. But the main one seemed to be looking at Wil. Amused, thinking he was an idiot, Wil shouted down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Know of anything interesting for us to see? Treasure?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Nelgaunt looked up at Wil as the others laughed. And then—suddenly—it dove. Wil saw the dolphins turn, diving after it. In a moment, they were gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Was it something I said?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil looked around, disheartened by the sudden disappearance. He couldn't help but feel he'd caused it. But he hadn't. In fact—a warning call came from the front.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Storm Captain! We're nearing Kraken's Pass!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was turning the ship. Venaz ducked as the boom sailed overhead. Captain Lasc whirled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Already? Turn us, do it now, man!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was already turning the ship. Wil didn't know why. Until he saw…how deep the waters were on the port side. The [Sailors] fell quiet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Nelgaunt warned us. Or perhaps we'd have noticed if we weren't caught up watching them. Lord Kallinad, we're taking a detour."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc strode to the wheel. He pulled out a spyglass and stared ahead. The other [Sailors] were suddenly, entirely quiet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kraken's Pass?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik looked at Inky for confirmation. The [Storm Sailor] was pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The water ahead. It's a vast, &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; trench. Miles deep. And what lives in it is—at least one Kraken. Sleeping, mostly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The entire ship was quiet. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was turning. Wil felt his skin chill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Navy-destroyers. The rulers of the deep. I've heard they ate Dragons in the old days. Or that a Dragon was what it took to down them. They ate the entire Antinium fleet, or so it was said, when they came from Rhir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan had surrendered the wheel to Lasc. The entire ship was moving in silence. Even below—the Drowned Ships were turning. And no one spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing survives a Kraken attack. Or if they do—they're truest [Sailors] of the sea. I'd rather fight an Adult Creler at sea than a Kraken. Well, you don't fight one. They can be &lt;em&gt;miles&lt;/em&gt; long. Fortunately, they mostly sleep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Does anything prey on them? How can they live, being so big?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Calmly, but controlled, Captain Lasc turned his head to look at Feshi, who'd asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There're things in the deep that are more dangerous than we can imagine. Not all things are violent, Miss Feshi. And the sea has its ebb and flow. I've seen Tearwhales devouring and devoured by smaller fish. But they could bring down a Kraken if there were enough of 'em. It's all give and take. But we sail in silence now. Well clear of Kraken's Pass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others nodded. Everyone headed belowdecks. Inky reassured the others as she pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's safe enough. Captain Lasc is steering us far from the pass. We'll be around in less than a day. What's dangerous is when they move. Then—well—you can be attacked in any place the sea's deep enough. Come on, Sea Cow. You can teach me more of these board games."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil was following her down when he heard a muffled curse from the helm. He looked back. Just in time to see Lasc staring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What in the name of salt is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] turned the wheel. But it was too late. Wil saw whiteness rolling at them. A vast cloud of—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fog.&lt;/em&gt; It rolled over the ship unnaturally fast. And it was dense. Vision was lost in a moment. Wil could barely see the command deck. He staggered forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Lasc?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man was staring about. There were shouts of confusion from all around. And then silence again. Slowly, the [Storm Captain] let go of the wheel. And he looked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Furl the mainsail."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drop anchors?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan had raced back on deck. The [Storm Captain] hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're too far. No. Furl the sails. &lt;em&gt;Quiet.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's the fog from, Captain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Wil realized, as he stared around that there was no way of Lasc of knowing where they were, either. The sky was shrouded. They couldn't see the Kraken's Pass. They were…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Two days later, the fog had continued. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; floated in the waters, sails furled. Helpless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had no idea where they were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We could be &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; the Kraken's Pass right now. We should be sailing away. Better that than…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Begal was wide-eyed with nerves. Inky, the [Storm Sailor], was more calm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't be daft, man. Captain Lasc knows we might well sail in circles. And if we &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;, we'll attract more attention. This fog ain't natural. But whatever it be, we can only hope to wait it out. At least the wind ain't moving. The waves on the other hand…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were just floating. Captain Lasc had lookouts posted every few paces on deck, for all the good it did. Everyone was aware of how close they were to the Kraken's territory. And they were all nervous for the fog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Becalmed at sea. Lost. Isn't this a [Sailor]'s worst nightmare?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik wondered. Inky gave him a reproving look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Neither and neither, Mister Merrik. We can always [Message] for help or scrying if our [Captain]'s not a fool or something wrong with magic. Same with wind—if we wanted, Lasc could conjure us a breeze with his Skills alone. Never mind the emergency items. What we fear is Krakens. Fire at sea. And—&lt;em&gt;The Last Tide.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Sailors] sitting with the students murmured. Wil looked up. But no one said anything more. This was a bad time for dark tales. Especially ones that were true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There's not much to do but keep an eye out. Right, Feshi? I mean, that and—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not interested, Merrik."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf sighed. Venaz gave him a look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This fog is unnatural, Merrik. Every [Warrior] knows you conserve your energy?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean, you don't jump into bed before a battle?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur looked aghast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What a waste of stamina. No. Minotaurs are &lt;em&gt;disciplined.&lt;/em&gt; Besides…we don't know what's causing this. It feels like a spell."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But what a vast one. Or is it just on our ship? Lasc is asking for Wistram's assistance, but there's limits on what they can do, especially if the fog is magic. We'll try lifting it if we have to wait longer. But there's a limit on how long—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Contact above! Get on deck!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A whisper-shout. The [Sailors] and students shot to their feet. They raced above, silently as possible. Armed for battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Below, the Undersea Crews were restless. They knew of the fog, of course. It didn't affect them underwater and &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; was drifting, dangerously close to the Kraken's Pass. But far enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's causing the damn fog?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium growled at his First Mate. She frowned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're spotting multiple vessels in the water, Captain. All land ships. Caught by the fog."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"More tails to the students and their treasure? But they've found &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; yet!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe the others are tired of waiting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll be damned if I let them take our mark."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Therrium swore. He looked up, sharply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Another ship's closing with &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Get me &lt;em&gt;eyes&lt;/em&gt; on what's happening. How many vessels are in the water?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt;, Captain. Some are in the sea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt; Drowned Ships? Why aren't they hailing us? Unless they fear to make sound or light?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know, Depth Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The first vessel passed close to &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; It was a small ship. Not close to the galleon-class that was &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A caravel."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky breathed as Captain Lasc peered through his sky glass. The students watched, cautiously. It was a small vessel to take on the galleon. And it didn't seem to be. The sails were furled. But there were people on deck, staring up at the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ahoy. Are you lost in the fog too? We sail the storms. If you be peaceful, raise the flag of truce."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;First Mate Delivan called out softly. His voice was the only sound in the waters. The figures on the boat stared. There were a good number of them. On the railings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They made no move. But neither were they triggering anyone's [Dangersense]. Yet. The two vessels drifted closer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The waves were taking both vessels in the same direction, but the caravel was lighter and moving faster. It was chance that the two had met. And as the ships drew closer still, the fog parted enough for Wil to see something in the mists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Red light. A strange, ominous glow in the darkness, multiplied many times. And then—amid the fog—he realized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Crimson eyes. The crew of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; recoiled as they saw Goblins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They stood on their ship. Crudely built, but seaworthy. &lt;em&gt;Goblins.&lt;/em&gt; Many of them were small, but Hobgoblins sat or stood along the side of the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Goblins."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz breathed. He reached for his axe, but Inky and half a dozen [Sailors] held him back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not here! We're too close to the Kraken's Pass!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But they—let go of me!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Someone slapped a hand over his mouth. The Goblins looked up. They stared at the Humans with curiosity. Without fear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Have you caused this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc's voice was wary. Cold. But the Goblin's sails were furled. And—one of them moved. Wil saw a figure sitting on the deck. His hair was beaded. His skin tattooed. Feshi murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A [Shaman]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stared at the Goblin. Small. He was a regular-sized Goblin. But he was in charge in some way. He glanced at her. And then he grinned at Lasc. Slowly, he brought one finger to his mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he mouthed one word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krakens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Without a word, the caravel drifted past &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; The [Storm Captain] hesitated. Venaz was furious. He wanted to attack, or interrogate the Goblins. But they were all—wary. The Humans let the Goblins pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've seen Goblin crews only twice in my life. I heard they sailed the ocean. But even they fear Krakens."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky murmured when the caravel was long out of sight. Captain Lasc was trying to figure out what was going on with Delivan and the students. Venaz stared through a port window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course they go to sea. They have an island."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at him. But the Minotaur said nothing more. Lasc looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yet—they were helpless as we were. The fog wasn't caused by them. And if their [Shaman] couldn't raise it—they control the weather. So. Something's out here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others nodded. They did not know what. But the watchfulness of all on board sharpened further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was another day before they found out what it was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain. Lord Kallinad. We have a signal in the mists."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A ringing bell. Wil heard it as he played Lasc a game of chess. The [Storm Captain] looked up, glad to be done; he was losing badly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hear it. What fool rings a bell around here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The kind that doesn't fear Krakens. Storm Captain. You had better look."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On deck again. Everyone stared towards the ringing sound. And Wil saw it first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ancient hull. A sail, rotted, virtually useless.&lt;/em&gt; But the ship still floated. And—it had a crew. But the fog was lifting, however slightly. And this time…&lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet's&lt;/em&gt; crew could see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was no light on the other ship. None, in the absolute fog. &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; had any number of safety lanterns. But none on the other ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That told Lasc everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Either they're out of oil. Or…we've found a culprit. It's a ghost ship. Or—did you say you saw figures, Delivan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [First Mate] nodded. He was armed. Captain Lasc turned his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad. I fear we might be entering a fight for our lives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Against what, Captain?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil stood next to Venaz and Feshi, staring into the gloom. There &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; figures moving in the darkness. But who—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His breath caught as he saw the unnatural, shambling walk. The [Storm Captain] spoke darkly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's no ship of the living. That's an undead ship. And the crew's long passed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Indeed. The ship was coming their way. And Wil saw the first rotten form. He &lt;em&gt;smelled&lt;/em&gt; the rot as the zombies and skeletons moved. A mockery of the living ship. The [Sailors] murmured. They had weapons ready.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How can this come about?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi covered her nose. She had her bow raised, but she had avoided fighting. Lasc was cursing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Somewhere on board, there's a [Necromancer]. Or a death-artifact. Either or. And we'll have to &lt;em&gt;fight&lt;/em&gt;. This close to the Kraken's Pass?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"At least the ship's only a frigate. If it were larger…we can handle that crew, Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Delivan was nodding. So were the other [Storm Sailors].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Undead aren't a match for a proper [Storm Sailor]. They might have numbers if they'd packed the ship. But we'll take them. Worst threat is the [Captain]. Ships like this always have a Revenant."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki looked around blankly as Yerranola shuddered. The Selphid spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A thinking undead. A trapped soul. It might be able to use Skills. It'll be far stronger."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Indeed—was that the [Captain]? Wil saw a figure steering the ship at them. Glowing eyes, burning blue in the fog. Captain Lasc spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"All hands, prepare to repel boarders. We'll fight them off. Burn the damn ship and put these souls to rest. They've underestimated us. Lord Kallinad, you and your [Strategists] will give us an edge, however many of the damned there be."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crew nodded. So did Merrik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My [Battalion of Glory] gives magical blades to anyone under my command. We can slay even ghost-[Pirates] with that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Have they given any demands?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc turned to Delivan. The [First Mate] shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, sir. This might be just a group of [Necromancers]. Or a ship looking to add to its ranks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"More fools, they. To arms. We've sailed through storms far worse than a crew of undead."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The ships were closing. Ready for battle, both sides. More undead were appearing in the gloom. But just one ship. Smaller than &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Only—Wil couldn't help but feeling uneasy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This felt like a trap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then the waters moved. Wil saw something breach the dark waters. And he realized he should have taken Inky's advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A warship rose out of the dark waters. Rotten, old. Covered in barnacles. But the crew cared not for the water that slowly drained. Captain Lasc turned his head. The second ship turned, slowly. And another figure, another long-dead [Captain] looked at the living man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Flanked. Damn—we'll take the left, Captain Lasc and Wil, Feshi, the right. Starboard, port, whatever."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik whirled. Peki narrowed her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strong undead."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fucking ghosts."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky pointed, eyes wide. A figure, a half-remembered man, skin rotted was the [Captain] of the second, larger, warship. He was pale. Transparent. But his blade was still sharp as he drew it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll take him on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf growled. The crew rushed to the port side. And that was when Wil felt his skin prickle. He turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A crow's nest breached the waters. A third ship rose, silent as the grave. Delivan slowly turned around. He made a small sound. And then a &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; ship rose. A fifth. He slowly looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. The thing about undead fleets? They keep growing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To arms."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc drew his sword. Six ships circled &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Without a word, without a signal, the undead began swarming towards the ship. Swimming. Climbing. Wil drew his sword. Venaz was already hacking a ghoul trying to board the ship. But they were outnumbered. And—the ghoul Venaz bisected fell into the waves—then reappeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There are &lt;em&gt;[Necromancers]&lt;/em&gt; about! They're reanimating the dead!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz roared. He swung his axe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Battalion of Glory]. They might not even be on any of the ships. We have to burn them. Take out the undead—waste the [Necromancer]'s mana! Hold the line!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola looked at him. The [Lord] had his sword out. He was calling orders, defending a section of the ship. The [Lord] turned to look at Yerra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm not going below."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know. Just don't get killed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid smiled. Then she walked into the undead, the one form fighting back the waves assaulting the [Sailors]. The students called out, fortifying their positions. But the undead were coming. A ghostly [Captain] strode through the air and met Captain Lasc. They locked blades and Lasc punched through the air. But the freezing ghost's form took no damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium saw the six undead vessels surrounding &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; from below. And he had been told at least two more vessels floated in the fog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damned [Necromancers]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the two vessels had to be their command ship. They were attacking &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt;, thinking they were just another ship on the waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His [First Mate] looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain, do we join the fighting?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His crew was restless. Drowned Men and Women were ready for a fight. They didn't fear the numbers. Nor did Therrium. He glanced at the other Drowned Ship. If they joined the [Storm Sailors], they'd put a hole in the undead fast enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;However.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fight? And expose ours plans? &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;. Not yet, at least."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But they'll all be slaughtered. There aren't enough of them and even if the [Storm Sailors] put up a good fight…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Six ships versus one. Therrium knew that. He spat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We wait. We only need the [Lord]. Make ready to rise. And when we do—you'll grab that [Lord] and we'll lose our sister ship in the fighting."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured at the other Drowned Ship. The [First Mate] grinned. Slowly, the Drowned Ship began to move. Air was conjured, negating the effects of the ballast. The ship was preparing to rise suddenly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And that was when a lookout shouted, breaking the oath of silence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Depth Captain! Another ship sailing into the engagement!" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Therrium Sailwinds turned. He snarled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;How many ships are out here?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc saw the ghost-[Captain] retreating as Merrik's glowing hammer rent the magical form that made him up. Lasc struck home with his shortsword. He thought he saw the other [Captain] smile at him for a second before he vanished, his form turning into mist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had worn a [Storm Captain]'s clothes. Lasc hoped he had found rest. He would never let his body and soul be stolen so. He whirled, nodding at Merrik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My thanks, Mister Merrik."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pleased. I just wish that killed the other undead."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Dwarf turned, grunting. A Garuda flashed past them. She kicked off a zombie's head and watched as the head slowly floated back to place. Peki frowned, and spun and kicked a skeleton to pieces. But it too began to reassemble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn [Necromancers]! They're reanimating the dead!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even &lt;em&gt;me!&lt;/em&gt; I don't think they know I'm in here!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A hulking Draug had torn off Yerranola's arm. But it was floating back to her body. She dodged around the Draug and sat it aflame with multiple chops of her hatchet. She watched her arm reattach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Neat. Thanks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was the only good news in the tide of undead assaulting the ship. The [Sailors] were fighting in formation, pressing the undead back. But the undead kept &lt;em&gt;coming&lt;/em&gt;. And every [Sailor] that fell instantly rose on the other side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We must break out! Raise the sails!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was shouting, ignoring the order of silence. Lasc pointed; the sails were already dropping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Ship Spell: Bound Wind]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment, a wind blew and &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; began to shift. But the other boats had it boxed in. And—the wind abruptly halted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They have weather spells! We can't escape!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi pointed out the obvious as she fired an arrow. One of the ships burst into flame as her arrow tip exploded. But even the fire died down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Mages]. &lt;/em&gt;Lasc felt a moment of despair. His forces were holding well. But this was a battle of attrition. And he couldn't &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; the [Necromancers]. He aimed at one ship. He had one [Depth Explosion] spell to use. They'd fight. And then—the [Necromancers] might run out of mana and mana potions first. If not…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain! Something's coming out of the fog!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky bellowed from where she was fighting with Venaz and a group of [Storm Sailors]. The [Captain] turned his head. &lt;em&gt;Another&lt;/em&gt; undead ship?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No. The last ship came through the waters, surprising Lasc. The [Necromancers]. Even the Drowned Folk. Fast, &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;, cutting through the fog. And in more ways than one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Light. It burned through the fog. A bright, brilliant yellow light. Like some gigantic lantern. It filtered down through the sea. Captain Therrium shaded his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Are they mad? The light's visible in the darkness! They'll wake the Krakens! Who's casting that spell?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He roared. The [First Mate] pointed up. Her skin had gone pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not a spell, [Depth Captain]! Look! Look at the hull!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Drowned Man looked up and saw. A shining hull. The material that made it wasn't normal wood. It was glossy. Semi-transparent. And it &lt;em&gt;glowed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The light burned away the fog where it touched. A magical light. For a magical ship. It shone through the darkness and night. Moving faster, &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc turned as he cut down a ghoul. He saw it coming closer. And—it couldn't be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But only one ship was filled with fools crazy enough to bring light to the Kraken's Pass. And in the distance, he saw a name, written by magic on the side of the hull as it turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Illuminary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain]'s eyes widened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's &lt;em&gt;them. &lt;/em&gt;Why are &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik turned. He spotted the distant ship. It was—pursuing something. A second ship, running dark. The [Necromancer]'s painted ship, made to be white-grey, invisible in the fog. It was turning—but the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; was three times as fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Merrik stared as the glowing ship came at the first. It didn't slow. It &lt;em&gt;hit&lt;/em&gt; the [Necromancer]'s ship with a &lt;em&gt;crash&lt;/em&gt; of sound that split the air. The [Necromancer]'s ship cracked. The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary &lt;/em&gt;did not. He saw a glowing figure, glowing with the same light as her ship, swinging across to the other ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead shuddered. They lost some of their cohesion. Became aimless. And they did not rise again. There were still hundreds, at least a thousand of them. But someone had slain the [Necromancers]. Merrik turned his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Grandfather's beards! &lt;/em&gt;Reinforcements?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Captain Lasc just stared. The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary &lt;/em&gt;was turning. He shook his head and sighed, looking—well, worried.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No.&lt;em&gt; [Pirates].&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The fog was lifting. As the last [Necromancer] died and the ship began to burn, a figure strode out of the flames. She caught a rope as it was swung out to her. Held on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The passing ship yanked her off the deck. She swung through the air with a dozen other figures, back towards the glowing ship. The&lt;em&gt; Illuminary. &lt;/em&gt;She landed. And she was glowing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Glowing, like her ship. The woman was half-Drowned. Half her face was Human. The other half covered by a bandanna. But her right eye—and shoulder gleamed. Something bright burned in her body. Yellow light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Half-Anglerfish. She grinned with sharp teeth. And a voice called out to her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain?&lt;/em&gt; Your orders?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The sky was exposing itself. It was sunset; but the fog had been thick as night. The [Pirate] lifted her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Onwards! Take out those undead ships! We've done for the [Necromancers]! Quick, before they do for that Lord Kallinad and those students!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed. And the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt;. It shot forwards, propelled by a wave underneath the ship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some called it the fastest ship in the world. Including the Captain herself. She didn't wear a hat. But she had a glowing sword in hand. She pointed; the fighting had continued after the [Necromancers] had died. The undead were still undead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hurry up! We'll miss the action!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As if the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; was moving too slow for her. Her crew looked up as the ship sped towards the cluster of ships. The [Pirate Captain] turned her head. She grinned up at the clear skies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. It's a wonderful day. Battles at sea. The Kraken's Pass! And treasure. What more could you ask for?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She laughed, fearless, as her ship's light threatened to wake the denizens of the deep. If she'd died at this moment though, she would have died laughing. And her crew laughed too. Fearless, and insane, all. Even by the standards of [Storm Sailors] and Drowned Folk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But these were [Pirates]. The glowing [Pirate] looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Prepare a boom throw! I'm going in first!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Helmsman] roared with laughter. He was a tall Gnoll. He saw the [Pirate] grab hold of a rope. Someone had attached it to a boom. He spun the wheel and the boom snapped around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;You had to watch the boom. But she &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; watched it. And the rope attached to the moving part of the ship &lt;em&gt;snapped.&lt;/em&gt; The boom flung outwards. And she swung through the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Incoming!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki, flying through the air and hunting for the strongest foes, saw a flying shape. The [Martial Artist] turned and saw the flying [Pirate]. The half-anglerfish woman winked as she passed by. She landed, and the light flashed, brilliantly yellow. The undead whirled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;To me! Take these rotting corpses down!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her glowing blade beheaded a Draug. The [Pirate] swung around, slashing through a zombie, a ghoul—she stepped back as a skeleton swung a sword at her. Then she raised her offhand. A glowing crossbow bolt caught the skeleton's head and the detonation blew all the undead off their feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate] was already rolling away. And laughing. The crossbow began to reload itself, magic doing all the work as she slapped another bolt into place. She brought her sword down and slashed &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; a ghost of a woman. The undead vanished. The [Pirate] whirled, and saw a Minotaur staring at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who are &lt;em&gt;you?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz stared at the [Pirate]. She laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just a friend!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a thunderous &lt;em&gt;crash. &lt;/em&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary &lt;/em&gt;had docked—by ramming &lt;em&gt;through &lt;/em&gt;the largest warship. It had a metal blade attached to the keel, instead of a figurehead. And it had cut through half of the now-sinking ship. Figures grabbed ropes and swung over to &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Pirates]. Drakes, Gnolls—a pair of Lizardfolk. Even a damn &lt;em&gt;Centaur&lt;/em&gt; leaped over the gap, not even bothering with a rope. Some Drowned Folk too. They landed and began to hack the undead apart. They were armed with glowing blades. And the ship still shone bright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;To arms! Push the undead back! And hoist the colors! No quarter!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] ran past Venaz, her sword carving through everything in her way. And the Minotaur saw the foreign ship sailing two flags. He saw a skull and crossbones, a traditional flag. But the eyes burned with light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Pirate]'s flag. And just below it—a second flag. The Minotaur's eyes narrowed. He absently kicked a zombie backwards and buried his battleaxe in a lumbering amalgamation of undead—then he put it together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Flag of Savere."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil Kallinad saw the arrival of the [Pirates] shift the course of the battle in a moment. Not just the dramatic entrance of the [Pirate] who'd literally &lt;em&gt;hurled&lt;/em&gt; herself across the ocean. All of the crew of the new ship were—elites. It was a smaller ship than &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; No galleon—a modification of a smaller ship. Strangely, it had only one sail for a vessel so large.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it had any number of oddities. Not only did the hulls &lt;em&gt;shine&lt;/em&gt; with whatever they were made of, the ship was armed with more than spells. There was a &lt;em&gt;ballista &lt;/em&gt;mounted. No—six of them. The rare siege weapons snapped, blowing undead to bits. And the crew?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crew were all armed with magical blades of some kind. They cut through the undead even faster than the [Storm Sailors]. Wil saw their [Captain] dueling one of the Revenant undead captains. The undead was fast and had even skirmished with Lasc. It had a [Fencer]'s grace. But the glowing [Pirate Captain] was just as fast. She disarmed the undead in a slash and cut it in half. She was laughing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Those are &lt;em&gt;elites! &lt;/em&gt;Where did they &lt;em&gt;come&lt;/em&gt; from?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Feshi stared wide-eyed as the crew pushed the undead off the deck. The [Sailors] shouted, seeing only the reinforcements and not caring who they were. They charged the undead, hurling spells and even lanterns and oil onto the other ships.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The undead vessels burned, bereft of the magical support to stop the blazes. The rest of the undead were hurled into the sea. Only then did both crews stop. And Wil saw Captain Lasc's face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah! That was refreshing! No Kraken, though. They must all be napping!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] was laughing as she wiped her glowing sword. She was still illuminated—part of her shoulder, her right eye—it was all glowing. Like…Wil had never seen an anglerfish, so he could only approximate it to a [Light] spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Everyone alright? Are uh, all the passengers alright? Wouldn't want anyone getting hurt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate] was glancing about, looking at Venaz, Merrik, Peki—everyone was fine. Yerranola had lost an arm, but she'd gotten it back. A few cuts or bites—a ghoul had taken a chunk out of Wil's arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He only felt the pain now. And a healing potion helped regrow the lost skin and muscle. Wil winced as the woman looked around. Her eyes fell on him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Aha.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She winked at another of the crew who'd come over. The Centaur. At sea. The [Sailors] stared as the Centaur stowed the pair of crossbows she'd been using to blow undead to bits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who—just who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you? I mean—thank you for the save. We thought we were goners. But who…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mystified, Yerranola looked at the group. She didn't seem to realize they were [Pirates]. But Captain Lasc hadn't sheathed his blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Me? I'm just a passing [Captain]. Saw the fog, thought you might be in trouble. [Necromancers], tricky business. Shame I couldn't recruit—I mean, negotiate. But there you were."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman shook hands with Yerranola, beaming. She had sharp teeth on one side of her face. Wil blinked as she studied him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm exceptionally grateful, Captain. I am Wil Kallinad, passenger of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; And you are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate] focused on Wil. And she grinned wickedly. But then she reached up—felt at her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where's my hat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You left it in your bag of holding."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the crew members muttered. He was a Drake and he was armed with a cutlass. He also had wings. He'd flown over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You let me fight without my &lt;em&gt;hat? &lt;/em&gt;What kind of crew are you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman complained. She produced a magnificent hat from the bag of holding at her side. She put it on her head. Then—promptly swept it off as she gave Wil a bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Rasea Zecrew. At your service!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rasea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The name made Venaz start. The last name made Wil start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zecrew?&lt;/em&gt; It sounded like a common name. But if you were up on monarchies…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Kallinad, a few steps back if you please."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was Captain Lasc who laid it all to bed. He approached, flanked by Delivan and a squad of [Storm Sailors], including Inky. He was staring hard at Rasea. Warily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Rasea. I am Storm Captain Lasc of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt; Do you fly your colors for my ship?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gestured at the flag flying above the shining ship. And Rasea turned her head. Wil, backing up, saw the [Sailors] tense. But they looked worried. Alarmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki elbowed Merrik.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who is she? Why does she look like an enemy?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't know. Anyone?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was Venaz who replied. He and Wil knew the sea. He spoke, slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Unless I'm wrong, that would be— Captain Rasea Zecrew. [Pirate Captain] of the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt;. Rasea the Shining. One of the most feared [Pirates] on the seas."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other students inhaled. Rasea grinned broadly. And Wil murmured under his breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And related to Revine Zecrew. The Siren of Savere. The…[Bandit Queen], Revine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. You mean, my big sister."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Rasea laughed. She looked around the deck. Fearless. Her one eye shone. Captain Lasc looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you mean to take my ship, Captain Rasea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman paused. And her eyes twinkled. Like a kind of madness. The person who would sail bright lights through Kraken's Pass. She reminded Wil a bit of the Professor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone was tensed. But then—Rasea Zecrew just smiled. She shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not at all! I was just &lt;em&gt;passing by.&lt;/em&gt; I saw the fog—wanted to give a hand. We're not all [Pirates], me and my crew. Can we give you anything? Food? Water? Patch up your sails? Actually—if you lot were wanting to go somewhere, we'd be happy to escort you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She grinned. Wil stared at her as her eyes flicked to his face. And slowly, every head turned to gaze at Wil out of the corner of their eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the deeps, Captain Therrium, listening, slapped his face and groaned. Captain Rasea Zecrew beamed. She was indeed one of the most dangerous [Pirates] on the sea. Famed. Dangerous, unpredictable, and deadly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She also could not bluff to save her life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's clearly after your map of shipwrecks, Wil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola pointed out as the students took a desperate conference. The damage of the battle was being cleaned up. Undead parts tossed off the side. Damaged sail mended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The decks were being swabbed again. Wil was thinking hard. Merrik leaned over and gave Yerra a sarcastic look of shock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No kidding? And here I thought she really was just &lt;em&gt;passing by&lt;/em&gt;, and wanted to lend a helping hand."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So did I."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Peki raised her wing. Merrik looked at her. The others were silent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Rasea. The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary.&lt;/em&gt; I've heard it's one of the fastest ships in the world. The House of Minos has a bounty on her. She would not…be an easy foe to oust. Even if we had two ships the size of &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz was calculating the odds. Even he didn't seem keen to cross blades with Rasea. But she was still here. Blithely insisting she wanted to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc, Delivan, and all the other members of the crew were watching her like a giant snake in their midst. And Wil—had no idea what to do. Rasea wanted to escort them to their next destination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"'Twould be ungentlemanly of us not to. It's the [Pirate]'s Code—we have to help those we do a good turn to get to their destination. Or some such."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We have a code?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea kicked the Centaur. She was insistent. And Captain Lasc was unable to press her off the boat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We appreciate the assistance, truly, Captain Rasea. But my crew and I have the matter well in hand—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can't help in any other way? Actually—we'd be glad to escort your passengers anywhere you want. Not to say this isn't a fine ship. But the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; is the fastest ship in the world."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman grinned crookedly. Lasc stiffened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"As…helpful as that would be, I've made a pledge to escort my passengers wherever they wish to go."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aw. Really?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What if we—&lt;em&gt;insisted?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman laughed at the way the [Storm Sailors] tensed. She waved a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just a joke! Just a joke!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain Rasea. We are truly grateful. But perhaps we should leave discussions of this sort until after we've left the Kraken's Pass?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil broke in, having come to a quick decision. The [Pirate Captain] glanced at him. Then she grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Just as you like. All aboard, mates! Let's see where &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; goes, eh?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She winked at Wil. And he wondered how in the world he was going to deal with &lt;em&gt;this.&lt;/em&gt; But he had an idea. It was a stupid one. But it just might…fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The [Pirate]'s Promise, and a Moment of Awe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Two ships sailed out of the waters around the Kraken's Pass. Well—four. Therrium was cursing blue streak. He knew Rasea. And her ship spelled trouble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil knew it too. So did Captain Lasc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have no idea why she hasn't kidnapped you, sir. But [Pirates] are an odd sort."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Pirates]? She's a Drowned Woman, though, Lasc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil frowned. The [Captain] hesitated. He was sitting in conference with the students in his cabin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Technically—no. I know Captain Rasea's legend. Most do. She was a [Pirate]. She joined the Undersea Crews—that's the name for the drowned Folk who turn to their brand of piracy. Even took the Sea's Bargain. Half-angler, that's her. And her ships glows like she does. But she left the Undersea Crews. She's a [Pirate]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Which means she preys on everyone, including Drowned Vessels. How good is she in a fight?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola looked around. First Mate Delivan inhaled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean—can we repel her crew? No. There're less of them, but each one's as good as a [Storm Sailor]. Better."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then we have to be clever. Outwit her. We can't—fight her. Those are &lt;em&gt;Minotaurian &lt;/em&gt;ballistae. She's seized them from House of Minos ships she's sunk. We must trick her. I vote that we send her to the giant crab. That's treasure. She can battle it out with them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz punched his palm with a fist. Wil shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't think that will work, Venaz. We can try, but…Captain Lasc, did you say [Pirates] have an odd sort? An odd sort of what? Honor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Aye, Lord Kallinad. Odd as it is, they do their own thing. Some kill every person they raid—like the damned Bloodtear Pirates. Savage armada, that lot. Others have rules. The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; kills only those who fight back. So they're more traditional. They're all completely mad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're also tied to Savere. A [Pirate] nation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil thought aloud. He had…an idea. It mainly hinged on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; crazy Rasea was. And given that she had been disappointed there was no Kraken attack, he guessed the answer was 'very'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, Lord Kallinad! And Captain Lasc! Can I help you? Say the word! We could conjure you a stiff breeze if you want to move faster!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Illuminary&lt;/em&gt; was easily keeping pace with &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet. &lt;/em&gt;Wil looked at Rasea, lounging on the railing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Actually, Captain Rasea, we were hoping we could—parlay."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman looked blank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What does that mean? Oh, negotiate your surr—I mean, talk? Why not?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—we were hoping to make this a solo venture, Captain Rasea. We're greatly indebted to you, but I'm on a sort of private mission. My teacher, the Titan of Baleros, has given me some…leads. It's a secret, so I cannot share all of it. But—you haven't &lt;em&gt;heard&lt;/em&gt; anything about it, have you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-angler woman hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? &lt;em&gt;Me?&lt;/em&gt; No, we were just in the area, right, lads?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right. We didn't hear a Minotaur and Selphid bragging about—wait. Nothing!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The rest of Rasea's crew lied about as well as their [Captain]. Wil's head slowly turned to Venaz and Yerranola. The two [Strategists] instantly looked away. Merrik edged over slowly and whispered at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Venaz? I'm going to break your legs in your sleep."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You can do mine. Oh, dead gods. You think they heard when we were drinking, Venaz—?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerra was blushing orange through her dead skin. Wil wanted to throw himself overboard. Or his friends. He put his head down, and then raised it and smiled artificially at Rasea. She still thought he hadn't caught on. Or she didn't care how transparent she was being. She was still glowing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, Captain Rasea, I'd prefer to do the rest of my…exploration in peace. I appreciate the assistance, truly. However, we're very grateful. As thanks—what if we put you on the lead of some treasure?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea's eyes lit up. Literally; her right eye glowed brighter and her crew grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Treasure? &lt;/em&gt;Well, we'd never say no to that. What did you have in mind?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We found a…shipwreck. The very same ship charted by Archmage Zelkyr in the past. It's guarded by a rather large crab and it's quite—dangerous. There's an active war golem inside. But I'm sure that there's a &lt;em&gt;bounty &lt;/em&gt;of treasure. If you wanted—as a reward for saving our lives—we could give you the locations."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil carefully spoke. Rasea was just smiling at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, that would be…wonderful indeed, Lord Kallinad. A crab, you said? And an Archmage's treasure. That'd surely be an amazing haul. However—we couldn't take that from you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She didn't blink once. Wil's heart sank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You…wouldn't want to test yourselves against such a foe, Captain Rasea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well—it seems like a foe like that'd be very—dangerous. Especially war golems. With their fucking beams. I mean—whatever they do."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil glanced over the side. He stared down the length of the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary.&lt;/em&gt; And he noticed part of the hull looked…&lt;em&gt;patched&lt;/em&gt;. He glanced back up at Rasea. She winked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Might not be the easiest catch, Lord Kallinad. You have any more…spots? We'd settle for—one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord]'s heart sank. He looked at Rasea. She might be a poor liar, but she could spell out her demands. And she had a simple trade. He hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two spots&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;left.&lt;/em&gt; He looked at Rasea. If it came to it or having to fight her—he'd make the trade. But he had one last attempt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was stupid. It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to work. But here be [Pirates]. So the [Lord] straightened. He stood at the railing, and gazed at the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary's&lt;/em&gt; crew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Madmen. But not monsters, like some [Pirates]. He had seen Rasea laughing as she fought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Adventure-seekers. So perhaps—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you a romantic, Captain Rasea?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who, me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman looked taken aback at the question. She blinked a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I've teared up at a few stories. And I took to sea rather than maraud about on land. So you could say that. After all—I'm a [Pirate]. What's more romantic than the sky and open sea, eh? Especially danger. Monsters. &lt;em&gt;Treasure.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She spread her arms. And her crew cheered. Wil nodded. He pitched his voice, looking her and her crew in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, Captain. It occurs to me—that you could well speed me on my voyage. Were I and my friends to join you. But where would be the adventure in that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Pirate Captain] paused. She looked thoughtful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How do you mean?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is our first adventure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil indicated his friends. They stood behind him. Venaz, Feshi, Yerranola, Merrik, and Peki. The [Lord] spoke on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're students of the Titan of Baleros. But this—this is the first adventure we've had. At sea. With a…map. Given to us by the Titan himself. Our first voyage, really."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ah.&lt;/em&gt; Now that is a glorious moment. And has it been all you've dreamed of?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman's eyes lit up. Wil smiled, crookedly as she did with her sharp teeth on one side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Less. And more. Far less, sometimes. It was boring. But then—we saw something incredible. And it might be only the start. We sail to the House of Minos, to Izril. It might be the beginning of a story."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Illuminary &lt;/em&gt;were nodding. And Rasea's eyes were shining. She envied him. The first experience. And Wil Kallinad looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd like this adventure to be mine, Captain Rasea. I know it's impertinent. But—could you see your way to leaving this adventure to me?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She blinked at him. The crew stirred. Lasc looked at Wil as if he were insane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You want me to turn my ship and leave you to your adventure?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, otherwise it wouldn't be much of one. Not with Captain Rasea the Shining, would it? And I'd like it to be something…memorable."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man held his breath. There was &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; way this was going to work. But Captain Rasea struck him as the only person it might work on. She was staring at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A first voyage. Aye, I remember mine. I sailed through a storm in a tiny schooner. I found no treasure. But I dared the seas. And I…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes grew misty. She stared past Wil. He spoke, carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We'd consider it a boon. Just this once."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Centaur had folded his arms. He was glaring. But Captain Rasea was actually wiping at a tear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shut up. I'm thinking. Adventure. My crew. Not one of you joined me to die of old age. Or even for the riches of it, did you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at the [Pirates] on the &lt;em&gt;Illuminary.&lt;/em&gt; They shook their heads, laughing. Some rolled their eyes. But they were looking at her. Captain Rasea Zecrew grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nor I. In fact—we &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; the seas to take on the greatest challenges! We don't know what caution is! Do we prey on easy targets?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Only if we're out of drink!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll [Helmsman] called out! Rasea laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Exactly! I don't want to die &lt;em&gt;safe, &lt;/em&gt;like my sister! I want to &lt;em&gt;see the world! &lt;/em&gt;See the greatest terrors and glories the world has for me to witness! If I live to a ripe old age, I won't die in anyone's bed, especially my own! Before the end…I'll take the best of crews and a ship worthy of a legend and set sail for the final sea."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed towards the horizon. Everyone stared past her. Towards the sun. And past it—so far you couldn't see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The end of the world. The Last Tide. If we live to that age, crew. I promise you, we'll sail over the edge."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Rasea spoke to her crew, her eyes shining. Captain Lasc murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Madness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman's gaze swung around. She locked eyes with the [Storm Captain].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Madness? Aye! Perhaps! But what man or woman who dares the seas isn't but touched? And there's something there. Past the end of the world."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed again, urgently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There are &lt;em&gt;stars &lt;/em&gt;beyond the world's end. I've seen it myself. Surely they shine down on something. But the Last Tide swallows all ships. Even fleets. Brave [Captains] and crews have dared it. None have returned. So they must not have been high-level enough. Although stories say…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She paused. And looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someday. Aye. One last adventure. But for now? I respect your game, Lord Kallinad. And you've a tongue like silver. I see what you want. And I raise you this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She swept the hat from her head again. Wil tensed. But Rasea pointed up. Towards the second flag, flying below the pirate's flag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You have your adventure! By the flag of Savere, I swear you will not be troubled by us on your journey! But should you ask—we'll come calling for a share of the loot!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her crew laughed and cheered. And groaned and swore at their brash [Captain]. Wil stared. He saw Rasea laughing. And she plucked a bottle from her bag of holding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I swear by home. So drink with me and let's seal the bargain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled. Shining. Perhaps it was a [Pirate]'s mercy. But the students stared at Wil, awed. He looked at Rasea. A madwoman. But you couldn't help but like her kind of insanity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She burned with adventure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; join her crew?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola murmured. Rasea heard as a plank was lowered. She strode across it and winked at the Selphid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Apply after you graduate! We could always use a good [Strategist]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Selphid's mouth dropped. And Wil saw Rasea pouring a glass for him. She held it out and they touched the glasses. Rasea drank the strong liquid down. And he did the same. He coughed and she laughed and slapped him on the back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, damn. We'll just have to find something else. Maybe raid a Wistram ship. If only the King of Destruction were closer—I'd love to see him face to face, just once. Now there's a man who's a legend, for all my sister hates his guts!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She sighed. And her crew began to throw out options. The [Pirates] were laughing, merrily. Unconcerned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Underwave, Captain Therrium scowled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good riddance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; had no intention of allowing a happy adventure. But Rasea was mad. Even the Undersea Crews thought so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then—it happened. As the Illuminary began to turn, as Therrium waited for Wil to hopefully find a treasure. As Wil Kallinad wondered at his luck—someone pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain? I see a reef.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All heads turned. Captain Lasc strode to the prow of the ship. So did Rasea. Suddenly—they went quiet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Could just be a detached one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea called out to Lasc. The [Storm Captain] was staring down into the deeps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were in shallower waters. &lt;em&gt;'Shallower' &lt;/em&gt;meaning the sea was probably less than a thousand feet deep. But now—Wil saw something moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It looked…like a coral reef. He saw the waters, usually dark or obscured, light up. There was light from the reef, illuminated by the remnants of the sun. And light from the naturally luminescent plants as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And shoals of fish. They clustered around the reef, taking nourishment and protection from the plants. It was a magnificent sight—like the reefs around Pheislant, thousands of years old and alive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this one was &lt;em&gt;moving&lt;/em&gt;. And suddenly—every [Sailor] was staring. All the [Pirates]. Even the Drowned Folk. They stared in the distance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think it is. Dead gods. &lt;em&gt;Crew! To attention!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea looked at Lasc. He nodded. Suddenly, they were of one mind. Every [Sailor] moved to the ships as they turned, to present broadsides. Staring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? What's so special about that reef?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Shh! Be respectful!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Inky stood with the [Storm Sailors] she was staring down at the moving reef. It was…&lt;em&gt;strange.&lt;/em&gt; The reef seemed to be moving—not just floating. Parts of it were…definitely…moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think we're witnessing a grand sight. One that proves I was right. Ah.&lt;em&gt; Adventure.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rasea's eyes shone. Captain Lasc saluted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Storm Sailors]! Salute!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They copied his gesture. Some [Sailors] were even lowering their heads or kneeling. As above, so below. The Drowned Folk silently took a knee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt; The students were left out of the loop. Yerranola murmured. The waters were lighting up with the passing reef. It was &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt;. Nearly…two hundred feet high? Very vertical, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's just a moving bit of coral. What's so great about—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lasc's head slowly turned. And the even-keeled [Storm Captain]'s eyes narrowed with actual anger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The next man, woman, or creature on this boat who utters a word of irreverence, I will sink by anchor to the depths of the sea. I swear on my honor as [Captain]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He said it in a flat tone of voice. Yerranola's mouth snapped shut. No one uttered a word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Closer, the reef moved. Wil studied it, trying to figure out what had the seafolk so awed. There was something…strange about the reef.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Inky. What are we looking at?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Venaz spoke quietly. It was the [Storm Sailor] who replied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Guardian of the Sea. Far greater than dolphins or Nelgaunts or any other force. They ruled your lands, once. But they were defeated. They're terrible wrathful. But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gulped. Overcome by some emotion. Delivan took over for her, his voice quiet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They left the land, nature's guardians. Banished by civilization."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students looked at each other. Merrik's eye went wide. Slowly, he took off his helmet. Wil still didn't understand. The pieces were there. He stared. And began to make out something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The coral was moving. It was…walking. Two legs were carrying it across the sea's floor. The [Lord] stared. The coral was all…part of the thing. And the fish, the dolphins and other creatures that lived around the mighty protector…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of nature. A walking bed of coral. Ancient beings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then he had it. Wil murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's not coral. That's…a tree."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The others looked at him. And then they saw it. Fossilized wood. Nature, turned to coral. A banished protector of the land. Banished by civilization. Merrik stared wordlessly, and Peki bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A walking tree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A Treant. When the landfolk burned too much and cut down too many of their kin, they left the shores. But still, they walk the oceans deep. So few left."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sailors] saluted, the [Pirates] and Drowned Folk stared. The old world walked. And it turned its head, staring up at the small ships above. The Treant walked on. Guardian, tending to life. In any form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;How long Wil stood there he couldn't have known. But the moment left an impact on him. A sight rare even for those at sea. And for the first time—he thought it might be okay. Even if he had no treasure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because—this was an adventure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So it was that &lt;em&gt;The Emerald Signet&lt;/em&gt; parted ways with the somewhat honorable [Pirates]. A legend in her own right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They left behind a memory of a seeing a legend of nature. A Goblin ship. A battle with the undead at sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil even thought he was close to leveling. But mostly—he was happy now. Content. He lounged around the boat as Inky and some of the [Divers] went exploring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be the shipwreck spot, Lord Kallinad. But the location was somewhat unclear. We'll look around. After that, I might trouble you for another game of your damn chess. We'll break out the hooks too. Even days after they pass, there's good fishing in a Treant's wake."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Captain Lasc was speaking cheerfully as he stood at the prow of the ship. Wil was nodding and smacking his lips, thinking of fresh fish. The other students were laughing as Merrik read an ode to Feshi and she rolled her eyes. He was still trying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was an inauspicious moment. But even so—the diver's bell came up as someone ran the rope connected to the bell. Wil and Lasc turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Any news, Inky?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil saw the [Storm Sailor] stumble out of the sealed diving bell. The part-Octopus woman stared around. And then she looked at Wil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mister Wil? We found something. We're bringing it up."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wil blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was so sudden. So—casual. Inky pointed. Her eyes were wide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It wasn't touched. And it were right there. Out in the open. Amid the bones. It's…a chest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Storm Captain] stared. Wil's friends turned. Yerranola laughed, disbelieving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? Did she just say…? No way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They stared as shouting broke out from the side. And then—ropes were being lowered. Something rose over the side of the ship, covered in seaweed. Water spilled around it as it was lowered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A gigantic, magnificent chest. Inscribed with some sigils covered in muck. Wil &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt;. Inky pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was just…there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The students stared. Venaz stood up as Lasc strode over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods. No way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wil? That's not real, is it? Someone's playing a prank. Right? Right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yerranola looked around. But Wil was frozen solid. And Venaz was chuckling too. He strode over, glancing at Inky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Very funny. It looks real. But this is just a prank. Right? On 'Sea Cow'. Well done. It looks real. What did you do, smear a chest with muck and seaweed?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. It's real. I swear."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It can't be. It's not—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Minotaur reached for the lid. Only then did Wil come alive. Niers' warning flashed into his brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Venaz! Don't! It's cursed—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Too late. The Minotaur had reached for the handle set into the lid. And he yanked as he turned to Wil, about to laugh. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The lid exploded. Those on board covered their faces as sand &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; from the lid. Fountaining upwards, more sand than the box should have contained. Wil saw Venaz stumbling back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A vast cloud of sand filled the sky. The mortal [Sailors] and students looked up. Captain Therrium stared up through the water. And the clouds began to coalesce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Far away, a [King] sat up on his throne. And his eyes burned. He felt the power. He &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In the sky, a figure formed. Out of the sand, in the air he stood. Wil saw an undead face. Burning eyes. The [King] moved. And Wil was afraid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But this was no mindless undead. No force in this world controlled him. The monarch, the ruler of Khelt spoke as he gazed down on the ship. His eyes alighted on Wil, identifying the [Lord].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ah. Someone has finally uncovered the resting place of my treasure. Interlopers. This is not yours. But you have recovered a relic of my kingdom. And the generosity of Khelt is unrivalled. Return to me my treasure and I will allow you a half of it for your mortality.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed down. And Wil, gaping up at Fetohep of Khelt, looked down. And there—in the ancient casket lay a collection of six swords. They shone like the sky, after thousands of years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep of Khelt met Wil's eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Diamond Swords of Serept. Until your deaths I will grant you half. If you take my bargain. Refuse, and the curse of Khelt shall engulf you until nothing is left. Choose your fate."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He waited. And the [Lord] of Kallinad…hesitated. He looked at the swords. He looked upwards, at the figure made of sand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Diamond Swords of Serept?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Forged by Serept himself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're really here? We found them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The huge apparition inclined his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"After my predecessor's fleets did not, and they searched for hundreds of years. As I have said, my gratitude is vast. But they are &lt;em&gt;mine.&lt;/em&gt; Choose, boy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pointed at Wil and waited. The [Lord] paused. He glanced around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—this isn't a prank?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fetohep stared at Wil. He sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">487748</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:25:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Wandering Inn - 7.18 M</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/485802</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The irony was that there was nothing malicious in it. If anything, it was just…tiresome. A necessary task, born out of a mother's love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She wasn't even good at her task. Belavierr paused as she strung the glistening red thread made of living sinew through the air. She stepped back to regard her work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she saw nothing. No art. No craft. Just—her attempt to capture a word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Evil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Stitch Witch mused on it. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; evil? How could you know it when you saw it? She knew the world called her evil. But they called everything 'evil' in times. Half-Elves, when they ruled. Selphids by their turns. Minotaurs. Human tyrants. It mattered so little. Dragons, Witches—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everything was evil. So, nothing was. To Belavierr, the word was abstract. She would call herself &lt;em&gt;selfish.&lt;/em&gt; Greedy for power. She had given so much to live forever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But for her daughter, she would learn to define evil. She had made an attempt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"When they find this, will they call it evil? And will they know it is me? How many hunters will they send? Will they bring their grand armies? And shall I survive?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Witch] wondered. Did she have the strength? She had waxed and waned, with the changing world. She had never been so exposed in thousands of years. Close to mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But perhaps because she was so close, she could understand. Perhaps that was the thing that had led to her becoming a mother. Such a strange thing. Belavierr had held babies before. Too many to count. But only one moved her immortal heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For only one she would risk death. &lt;em&gt;To make her powerful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Perhaps my name."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman pulled at the thread hanging in the air. And it &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt;. Glistening red. Entrails, strung across a village. Bodies, unwound. But even this was just—artifice. A copy of a village she had seen long ago, struck by [Pillagers]. Someone had called it evil. Horrific.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But will they hunt me for it? Cry my name loud enough for her to hear?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Yes.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The voice, croaking, strained and raw, came from the side. Belavierr twisted her head and turned. The tall [Witch]'s form paused, at an angle. From beneath her wide hat, her orange, ringed eyes stared. And looked at one of the figures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had no legs. No midriff. Or rather—it was only connected to his torso by a single thread. His entrails were the string Belavierr was knitting with. Something had…torn away his lower half.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he lived. Despite the pain that made his words come between silent screams. But soon—that would cease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are awake. The others are gone. Why do you linger?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr regarded the man like a curious insect. She glanced around. The rest of the village was silent. Eyes were open, the unwound bodies…alive. For a given value of it. But the minds behind the staring eyes, the open mouths, were gone. Pain had given way to a kind of terrible relief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Oblivion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the man, the [Warrior], clung to life. He stared at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They will send hunters. The Five Families will see you dead.&lt;em&gt; Witch.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His voice strained with the effort of shaping words. Belavierr caught the other threads, unspoken. &lt;em&gt;Why? Why did you do it? What did our village do? Why are we suffering? Why was I not strong enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why, why, why? &lt;/em&gt;And she stopped. She looked at him for a long time. Long enough that he was foaming at the mouth, biting through his lips, struggling. But Belavierr sometimes still walked to an immortal's time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good. Let them send their warriors."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled. And something like anticipation, even pleasure, entered her eyes. Because the mortal part of her remembered the thrill of battle. The challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man looked upon the smiling [Witch]. He whispered, trying to give her fear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They'll send [Knights]. Champions. [Mages] too. They will find you and make you suffer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Good.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The word made him flinch. Belavierr was smiling. She laughed, then. Mocking his bravado. And she leaned down. He stared into her eyes and saw the forming rings. Many had been broken. But—the lines of her immortality were knitting slowly. He had put a sword through her chest and it had done nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I cannot be killed with magicless shears. And the great wonders are gone. The last of Giants rot and their descendants grow smaller. The Dragons have fallen from the skies. &lt;em&gt;Send your [Knights]. They have come by the tens of thousands. And they were never enough&lt;/em&gt;. The world has forgotten how to kill me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She laughed in his face. The man looked up. And if willpower were enough to bridge the gap between them—if you could make a sword out of determination—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His would not be enough. Even so. His eyes grew distant. He never replied. Belavierr straightened. And she looked at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that all? Hello?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She prodded him with a finger. But there was nothing left. He had cut his own strings. And for a second—the Stitch Witch was disappointed. She looked around, lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even the souls wane. Where are legends now, but in memory?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She threw open her arms and spoke to the sky, as if it could answer her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Send your champions. Show me a burning flame in this waning world! &lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt;. Or else my daughter will be as small as you. And she must live. She must find her power. But you grow so &lt;em&gt;small.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at the village. At the dead man's face. And then Belavierr turned away. Another village. Another marker. And—she glanced back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There, amid the hanging threads made of red. The strewn entrails, the slaughter, was a web crisscrossing the rooftops. And she had signed her name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BELAVIERR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Just in case. The Stitch Witch nodded. And she turned. A black horse waited for her at the outskirts of the village. Belavierr slowly mounted it and rode.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;To destroy. To commit evil, as best she could. The lands around Invrisil were quiet, filled with terror as small places went silent. But the Stitch Witch continued. There was no one to stop her. The people of this land had grown too small. And the Spider of Terandria was unmatched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A scuttling, wretched presence in Izril. A creeping shadow, walking in the light unopposed. Foulness, seeping from decay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Assassins], reclaiming their throne of fear. Plots in the darkness. But it was not unnoticed. They waned. But still—Izril's guardians lived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The study's doors were vast. Tall, and ashen pale—the wood was not a normal tree's living fibers. The door looked made of &lt;em&gt;stone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the wood had a small bit of warmth that the hall's temperature clung to. It was not stone. Rather, ironwood. A material made from a tree that had all but passed from the earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet, this door remained. And it had been carved over nineteen thousand years ago. So long that regular wood, even magicked, would have fallen to dust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were slightly open now. The girl quaked as she approached. But the [Lady] who was ushering her and the small crowd of children forwards was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, not that reassuring. She looked more annoyed than anything, but she was trying to hide it by a veneer of vague excitement and kindness. But the children—the perceptive ones—could see straight through it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This way, everyone. Remember your manners."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The children, all dressed in their best clothing, looked up at her solemnly. As if any of them needed to be told. They were standing more or less to attention. And nervous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They had on their best clothes. And with this group, 'best' meant they were attired like a group attending a noble's ball. Fittingly, in a way, but all the expense that went into each piece of clothing—it was all wasted. The one who waited within cared very little for such things, now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Is that you, Desinee? Well, enough dawdling. Send them in, then."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A crackling voice made the children start. It was familiar to them. But they cast a glance at the [Lady]. And she nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Right inside. Don't be worried."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was truly &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; at being reassuring. But she swung open the ancient doors. Ironwood moved silently. It was a heavy door. And contrary to its name—ironwood was &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; stronger than iron. It could have withstood a siege. It had in times past. The one sitting in the chair remembered one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come in, children. Let's see what the current generation is worth."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, the children walked into the room. And they found a study. Grand, filled with books. Tomes almost as old as the door. Warmth, too. Almost unbearable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A woman sat in the chair, by the fire. And she was old. Her hair was white, her skin papery. She sat in a wheelchair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not a machined, metal-and-plastic design from another world, but a more—primitive design. One made by people who had paid as much attention to the design and ornamentation of the wheels as movability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But there was magic woven into the chair as well that kept it light and someone had installed padded cushions to cradle the owner's back and sides. And then—she had had the chair remodeled to actually &lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt; her comfortably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It did not move as the children came to a nervous stop. The woman looked at each of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well? Step forwards. Sit or stand as you like. Let me look at you. My, you've all grown."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The children spilled forwards again. Some hesitated as they looked at the carpet. Sit on that? Without a proper &lt;em&gt;chair? &lt;/em&gt;It said something of their heritage that they considered whether it would wrinkle their fancy clothes, even at their young age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Zedalien. The door."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman looked up. The warmth from the room was spilling out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A figure moved. A man, tall and graceful and handsome, his hair blonde and turning to white, but his features barely lined, slowly closed the heavy doors. The [Lady], Desinee, stepped to one side as he did. She was Human, a [Lady]. But the man's ears were longer, pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A half-Elf. He bowed slightly. And the old woman sighed. She leaned back, and the chair moved to accommodate the motion. She looked at the young faces staring up at her. And she spoke slowly, searching each one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are all here because it is time. Twelve of you? Enough, enough bowing and curtseying. Sit or stand! But stop blocking the light!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The children jumped. They moved out of the way of the fireplace. The light was the only illumination in the room. The old woman sighed again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where was I? Ah, yes, the time. You're all old enough to be here. And I think…this is the last time I'll have the patience for this. So sit—and listen. You are all little brats. And I don't have the time to deal with you normally."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The little brats stared. They weren't accustomed to being addressed like this either. The old [Lady] continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But I do this for each generation. To ensure you know our history, not just what your parents teach you. If they even bother."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She snorted, and Desinee stirred. But it was a muted protest; she had been here as well. And she could remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are to learn the history of the Five Families. The true history, or at least—all that matters. Go read a book if you want to know our entire history. But when you are in my presence, today, I will tell you the truth. Hm? What's that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the children was respectfully raising her hand. The old woman looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Irisa, Great-Great Grandmother. I've actually been schooled on the history of our family and the other four Founding Families of Izril. I can recite it if you would like me to."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young girl, Irisa, had a rather expectant look on her face. The old lady stared at her. Desinee winced. She saw the old woman point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's the first one. Not a record, more's the pity. That was that little snot of a boy who wiped his nose on the door. Desinee."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. This way, Irisa."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] sighed and beckoned. Irisa started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? But I just—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Be silent."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] &lt;em&gt;frowned&lt;/em&gt; and made a motion with one hand. Irisa's lips snapped shut. She pulled at her lips, and then, white-faced, stumbled over to the side. To listen. But she'd failed. The other children stared wide-eyed at her. And then they turned to face the old woman. She snorted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"To speak in my presence is a privilege I afford few of your &lt;em&gt;parents. &lt;/em&gt;Now, be quiet and listen. This is a lesson. The Five Families. The founding families of Izril, who took this land from the Drakes and Gnolls thousands upon thousands of years ago."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My father says we didn't &lt;em&gt;take &lt;/em&gt;it—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A finger pointed. The boy recoiled as if he'd been slapped. His mouth slammed shut. And the old woman &lt;em&gt;tsked&lt;/em&gt; as the half-Elf led him to one side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How soon it begins. Listen to &lt;em&gt;me.&lt;/em&gt; We claimed this land and it was the Drakes' and Gnolls' land. Long before ours. We won it by spell and sword and blood. As far as I'm concerned, that makes it ours. But we took it. And they want it back. Argue over whether they deserve it, but argue with the truth of what happened and I will have Zedalien tan your hides."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All eyes looked at the half-Elf. He was white-haired, and he had a few signs of age. And in a half-Elf? He had been serving his position before they had been born. Before their parents had been born.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We took this land. Back when Dragons still backed Drakes. Five of Terandria's greatest noble houses sailed across the sea with the express purpose of &lt;em&gt;taking&lt;/em&gt; this land. And we brought artifacts, armies. And it took us eons, but we fought the Drakes and Gnolls back. Mainly because they were too busy fighting each other. But we &lt;em&gt;took&lt;/em&gt; it. That is a fact. Just like how half-Elves ruled Terandria as much as Humans in times past. Like that, Zedalien? They might as well know that too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed at the half-Elf and laughed. The half-Elf bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your will, Lady El."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. Mine. So—listen. I won't bore you with tales of our glorious victories or history. You only need to know what the Five Families are &lt;em&gt;now.&lt;/em&gt; And do you know what that is?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around, the matriarch of the El family. And the newest descendants of the House of El, one of the Five Families, stirred. They were aware this was a test. So—two raised their hands. The old lady pointed at one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You, boy?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're the House of El, Great Great Grandmother?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stared at him. He stared back, shaking with nerves. The old [Lady] leaned back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yes. We are. Go stand over there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young boy stood and walked over, flushed with shame. The old lady looked at the girl who had turned pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And your answer?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…In decline?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This answer made the old woman sit up. She peered at the girl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who told you that was the answer I wanted?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A pause. The girl turned white.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No one."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old lady snorted. But she didn't point to the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well then, you're right either way. And yes. That is what we are. In decline. But I think of it differently. We—all of the Five Families—have a curse. Each of us, each different. And they have left us in this state today. Faded."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She lifted a hand. And her thin skin shone in the firelight, exposing veins around spotted flesh. The children looked at her and she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is what age looks like. Afraid? You have many decades to go until this moment, you little brats. But remember it. You do not have forever. Now—listen to what I think ails the Five Families. Including our house. Where shall I start? How about…&lt;em&gt;Wellfar. &lt;/em&gt;They've been in my ears. Why, Zedalien?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The scandal between Lady Dealia and Lord Bein, milady. As well as Lady Hetessana Wellfar's claim."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf smoothly bowed. The old woman nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. And the [Assassins]. Yes. Wellfar. Coastal holdings. They control trade, and they are rich. Far richer than our house."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She chuckled with dark humor and the children shifted uncomfortably. The old lady mused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They led our navies to Izril in the first days. And they were always powerful at sea. They still are. But as I said—cursed. Wellfar's navies are rich still, but their family shrinks with each passing year. Infertile, the lot of them. Also cursed by their holdings; they ruled the seas, but they never expanded far inland. Do you understand?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She glanced at the kids again. The young nobles hesitated. One seemed to take this as a challenge. She stood up and recited in a loud voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The—the Wellfar family has earned money in trade from sugar and Eir Gel this year. Their profits are 13% up from last year, and they have ordered four new galleon-ships as a result. They—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A slashing motion from Desinee. The girl tried to keep talking for a good ten seconds after she'd been silenced. The old woman rolled her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What idiotic attempts. Thank your parents for disgracing yourself, girl. Hm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her eyes roamed the group of children. And she picked out a dozing boy. This time the matriarch's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Zedalien."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf smoothly stepped forwards. The awake children &lt;em&gt;jumped&lt;/em&gt; as they heard a &lt;em&gt;smack&lt;/em&gt; and a howl. The young [Lordling] shot to his feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;He hit me!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do it again, Zedalien. Unless he shuts up. And the rest of you—this will not take long. If you can't stay awake, Zedalien will hit you. And if that doesn't seem to work, perhaps I should cut the funds to all your houses, hm? The House of El does not have money for idiots who cannot listen for twenty minutes."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That silenced everyone present, even the howling boy. And he went pale with fear. The old woman looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Desinee, the fire is growing low. Put more wood on it. The scented stuff."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The younger [Lady] silently did as the old woman bid. And she manually added a log to the fire, even as Zedalien pulled the sniveling boy to the side. And the old woman nodded. She sat back in her chair. And she couldn't have stood to give the boy the back of &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; hand, even if she'd wanted to. Or else she would have done it already, rather than waiting for her servant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was old. Not as old as a certain Grand Strategist, but she was as old as her actual age. And her skin was frail, her body failing. But her eyes were sharp. And in them burned the same woman who had lived all this time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Once, there had been a fire they called a [Lady]. And she had burned like the sun. Now, she sat in the carpeted room as the heat rose. In her magical wheelchair, pointing now and then as she spoke. Dozing or distracted children were made to stand. But the old woman still spoke, because it was important. Because they needed to know, and because she was running out of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her name was Maviola El. And she was the leader of the House of El. When she spoke, it was with authority. And the children were afraid, because she could, at her whim, cut their families off from much of the gold that they so desperately wanted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Gold flowed through the El family's coffers, as much as came in these days. But the matriarch or patriarch of the family controlled the distribution of wealth with an iron fist. It was their way. So, each year, every family received a stipend on top of their own funds, and contributed money to the family's ventures each year as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;What was given was usually more than what was received. And those with value received the most. Hence the children on their best behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Where was I, Zedalien?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The House of Wellfar, Lady Maviola. You had described their affliction."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, infertility and reclusiveness, isolation. For all they're rich still. You could say they've done the best out of all of us. Except for the Terlands, maybe. Well—the Terlands."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola's eyes glittered. Not with fond memories either. The Five Families were allies, but not &lt;em&gt;friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Terlands. Plagued by idiots like their Lord Bein, but more than that? Victims of their &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt;. They did well, settling their lands. Too well. Their descendants keep to mage-towns and spell-castles and the fruits of the past. And they look outwards little. So little. But the same could apply to us all. And they did better than Veltras and Reinhart—what's that, young man?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A boy had raised a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Isn't Lord Tyrion the leader of the north, Great…Great Grandmother? I mean to say, he lead the armies against the Goblin Lord."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola's finger twitched. The boy looked crestfallen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't call me Grandmother. You may all call me Lady Maviola, or Lady El. And Tyrion Veltras? That boy? One might as well compare him to Magnolia Reinhart. Two identical children always butting heads. No, they have their own woes. Lord Tyrion? I wouldn't duel him on a tourney field, but anywhere else he's nothing much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The boys and girls stirred, the boys especially. Everyone knew of one of the most famed [Lords] living, Tyrion Veltras, renowned for his prowess on the battlefield. But Maviola was dismissive as she spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Veltras Family is cursed by many things. The Veltras fury, aye, when it crops up, and their land as well. They never quite settled the untamed wildernesses. The vast Forest of Vail. But then—they preferred it back then. They were magnificent [Beastlords] and tamers of the wild. In ages past. But time changed them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How, Lady Maviola?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A hand. The old lady stared at the young girl who'd passed her question. She narrowed her eyes, but decided to reply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They stopped raising as many animals. Turned to war, rather than just hunting and coexisting. Radivaek raises better dogs than Veltras hounds, and it used to be that Radivaek &lt;em&gt;didn't even exist. &lt;/em&gt;The wilds and their holdings mean the Veltras scions learn to fight. They make excellent [Generals] and [Warmasters]—poor leaders of men."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The children scratched their heads. They didn't appreciate the difference. Well, most of them. Maviola's eyes flicked from face to face, seeing which ones were thinking over what she told them, which were just vacuous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, that left only one of the families left, besides their own. Everyone waited as Maviola accepted a drink. Because the last family's name made some shudder, even in this safe place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reinhart. Richest and most powerful of the families. At the moment. The Reinharts were always snakes. Masters of tricks and poisons. Magnolia Reinhart is the most honest of the lot. She pulled her own fangs. But her family?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around. The children shivered. You heard stories of Reinharts, even in the other Five Families. They had a…reputation. But what had &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; been cursed by? Everyone waited. And Maviola smiled bitterly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You might think a house like Reinhart would slit each other's throats, but they've always been rather loyal to each other. They play deadly games, but they have few of the faults of other families. Their only curse was &lt;em&gt;Regis Reinhart. &lt;/em&gt;He preserved them. But he took from each generation. They should have buried him when he died the first time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;None of the children knew who that was. But that seemed to be all Maviola wanted to say. She sipped from her drink, paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And that leaves only one family left. The House of El."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She gestured towards the grand door, the study full of knowledge. The children looked up, awed by their past. And the old woman smiled as they stared at ancient weapons gleaming on racks, tomes of knowledge. The power of one of the Five Families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't get sentimental. All the weapons are replicas."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Heads snapped down. Maviola leaned back in the custom-made chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We are great crafters, artisans of magic. There was a time when we raised [Magelords] and [Spellweavers] who &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; the artifacts adventurers fought for, armed our armies with magic and sorcery as well as steel. We were mighty. But our curse has left us low. Lower than the other Five Families. And that curse is most pressing. Most dire."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Silence. The children's minds raced with apprehension. What could it be? Maviola sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Our curse…is that we are completely out of money."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone stared at Maviola. She sipped from her teacup and looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? A curse need not be intangible. The House of El is poor. Not destitute, but we have lost almost all of our great artifacts of old. All our investments. Everything. And we have been poor and growing more so over the thousands of years. Remember &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, when you beg your parents for a new horse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one said a word. They were all rather uncomfortable, the young scions of the El family, about what was being said. No one had ever spelled it out for them like this. Hence, Maviola. She drummed her fingers on the armrest of her chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No doubt, one of you will ask me why we don't simply make more money? Well, it has been attempted. But the truth is the Five Families are shadows of what they were. Strong shadows, but we do not have &lt;em&gt;Giants&lt;/em&gt; employed as [Mercenaries], for instance. Or [Dragonriders] from the Veltras families, or fleets of twenty thousand of Wellfar's ships. We had these things. And they faded. Now, the nobility of Izril is in a crisis. We lack leaders. We are fewer than any can remember. Even our best [Lords] and [Ladies] are…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She flicked one wrist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did I hear one boy who seemed to be a fan of Tyrion Veltras?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A girl pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was Lord Iminel, Lady Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman smiled pleasantly at the girl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That was a rhetorical question, girl. Stand over there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The girl shuffled off, feeling that she'd been tricked. Lady Maviola El sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tyrion Veltras and Magnolia Reinhart. A deadly flower with all the thorns in the world and a Wyvern wearing a wolf's fur. They replaced their parents. And they are &lt;em&gt;fierce.&lt;/em&gt; I'd never deny that. Thanks to the two of them, Izril's north survived the Antinium by aiding the Drakes and fought off the Goblin Lord. But beyond that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She shrugged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're two monsters who know war better than peace. Even Magnolia, for all she tries to keep her family and herself in line. When she was a girl she spilled blood to get her way like a [Hydromancer] calls water. She manages her estates well, and her allies. But she has a conscience. And that makes her &lt;em&gt;weak.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Comparatively, Lady El?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zedalien bowed from the side. The old woman grinned at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Comparatively, Zedalien. Thank you for reminding me. Magnolia Reinhart is the best of the Reinharts today. But listen, you little children. &lt;em&gt;We have had deadlier.&lt;/em&gt; Magnolia Reinhart is one of the most dangerous women in the world. Better than her mother and even grandmother. But&lt;em&gt; Salienn Reinhart&lt;/em&gt; died eight hundred years ago. And she drank the blood of her enemies and consorted with immortality for over three centuries. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; was a Reinhart among Reinharts. But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola began to cough. Zedalien hurried over and helped her. The children saw the old woman gasping, and then Maviola sat back, exhausted by the sudden fit. It was a familiar scene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Immortality has its price. But so does old age. Did I say Magnolia and Tyrion Veltras were flawed? They're well enough. But we've lost so many of our great leaders. During the Antinium Wars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Antinium Wars.&lt;/em&gt; They echoed still, as the children shifted. The House of El remembered those days. They had anniversaries, death dates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The March of Flowers was remembered. Was still &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt;. Maviola was nodding. Her eyes flashed bitterly as she recited names.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fulviolo El. Petria Terland and her sister, Ulva. My brother and the Terland twins would have been magnificent leaders. But losing Petria broke Ulva in half. So now there is me. And two children who snap at each other while the other families take sides. The family of El cannot duel the other four families like we used to. And there are too few of us left. The nobility of Izril. Too few to manage all the land."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Something can surely be done, Lady Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was Desinee who offered that. She was hardly immune to the dire talk coming from the House of El's matriarch. The old woman glanced at the [Lady]. She snapped, irritably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You want to fix it, Desinee? Go to your husband, lie in bed with a fertility potion, and give birth to a child a year."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] recoiled. Maviola laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't like that, do you? None of the new [Ladies] do. Pryde, Magnolia, even that harlot, Bethal, and all the others like Ieka don't want to birth eight children. Which is what we used to demand! But that's what's needed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked pensively into the fire, which was fading again. And Maviola's voice was cracked with loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We lost too many during the Sacrifice of Roses. Too many. Not just that our families decline. The Goblin King took a terrible toll."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This the children understood. Missing links of a family tree, that ended suddenly could be traced back to one day, or to one year. Izril's nobility had lost too many and had yet to rebuild their numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But what could be done? The new generation waited as Maviola looked about. Perhaps, &lt;em&gt;perhaps,&lt;/em&gt; the future lay with them. They would become the hope of their House, rebuild it to glory. The children looked at each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then—realized something. All of &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; were standing. They had been disqualified during the little history lecture. Silenced and made to wait by one side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only one of them was left. And she sat in front of Maviola. The old woman nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One made it? Better than last time. Have the other children go back to their families, Desinee. I'll speak to…this one alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other children were herded out of the room. The double doors slammed shut and the girl got to her feet. She stood very properly in front of Maviola. The old woman eyed her, sardonically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So, just you, girl? Your parents tell me you are a prodigy. They shout it, rather. Zeci, isn't it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lady Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The answer came at once. The old woman studied Zeci and the girl braced herself for any question in the world. But the one that came at her still caught her unawares.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you enjoy your studies, Zeci? Horseback riding, calligraphy, finances—your parents have you studying at all hours, don't they?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I enjoy it, Lady Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The girl replied after a moment's hesitation. The old woman looked at her and rolled her eyes. It was a gesture that indicated complete disbelief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really. You enjoy your studies? And all these costly [Tutors] and such?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Yes, Lady Maviola. I enjoy learning."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm. Interesting. Approach me, Zeci."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young [Lady] did so, tentatively. She stared up at Maviola's face, but without letting the imperious look deter her. The old woman smiled. Then she lifted a hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And there was fire. Brilliant, white fire. It rested in the hand of the old [Lady]. And she looked at Zeci's wide eyes. There was no heat, but the flame was &lt;em&gt;intense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you know what they called me, girl?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once, there had been a fire—&lt;/em&gt;Zeci gulped. She stared at the fire and then at the woman's face. Only her eyes burned with the same radiance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Y-yes, Grandmother. I mean…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fire. Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was. But—Zeci was also afraid. The matriarch of the House of El had lived for a long time. And—she had not always lived kindly. She spoke as she leaned down in her chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have a Skill that tells apart little girls who lie to me. Even if their parents give her tricks to avoid truth spells. Put your hand in the fire, Zeci El."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The girl stared at the flames, terrified, and then at Maviola. The matriarch grinned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It will only burn you if you lie, or try to lie. If you are truthful, you will feel nothing. But lie? And you will mourn that hand for your entire life. Like so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She lifted her other hand. And Zeci saw an old, old scar that travelled down Maviola's hand, all the way up to her upper arm. The girl recoiled, but the old woman pushed the flame towards her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Go on. Put your hand in the fire and swear that you enjoy your studies. &lt;em&gt;Do it now.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The girl flinched away. She reached for the fire with her left hand, stared at it, and then, abruptly, burst into tears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I lied! I don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to study all day! Don't make me touch the fire, Great Grandmother!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ah.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman sat back. Abruptly, the fire winked out. She looked at Zeci.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did your parents make you study?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes. They told me it would be good for our family. And they told me to say—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The girl, tearful, confessed everything in a rush. Only after she had let it all out did Zeci realize it might spell trouble for her family. She choked on her tears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Maviola—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do not be worried, Zeci. I will deal with your parents. And they will not be rendered entirely poor this year. But your lessons will cease and I believe you will take only the ones you enjoy—and perhaps some that are necessary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Thank you, Grandmother!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The girl threw her arms carefully around the old woman. Maviola patted her on the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There, there. And remember—do not lie to me!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pinched a cheek and Zeci nodded obediently. Maviola waved a hand and a shadow moved. Zedalien led the girl towards the door. Only when he had escorted her outside did he return.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And only then did he address Maviola more casually, as the two sat in silence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tormenting children with illusionary fire, Lady Maviola?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She laughed, tiredly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Someone must. It keeps them honest. Well, I've hopefully put some wisdom into their heads, which is a fine day's work. Take me to the workshops, Zedalien. Let's hope we have good news to go along with resolving little Zeci's ridiculous situation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lady El."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The wheelchair moved softly across the carpet as the half-Elf pushed Maviola's chair. She drew the shawl around her body as they left the warm study. Maviola saw Zedalien glancing at her as they left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't mind me, Zedalien. I don't need to be coddled for long. I plan to announce my retirement…within the week. Sooner, if I can do it with one last triumph."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Elf's face was eternally youthful. Beautiful, with an immortal's features. Otherworldly as well. But he was older than Maviola. For all that—she was the more aged of the two, in body and in soul. Yet the half-Elf was the one who ducked his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So soon, Maviola?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I can't do this another year. Or a month. My bones hurt. I could cough and break my ribs again. I'm tired, Zedalien. It's time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman's voice was frank. The half-Elf looked as though he weakened with each step.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And yet—your predecessor, before Lord Fulviolo if you will pardon my lapse, Lady El—she felt strongly enough to continue into her ninety-eighth year…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My body gave out before my spirit, Zedalien. That's all there is to it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My apologies, Lady El. I—forget myself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zedalien shook his head. With effort, he took a firmer grip of the chair as they moved down the hallway. The old woman continued, almost cheerfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Forget? You remember everything, Zedalien. And you—don't age. Half-Elves. Half-Elves were the finest idea we had, employing your people as aides. You &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt;. I am counting on you to teach the next leader. Which will likely be Deilan, for all the girls think I'll favor them. He's pretentious. But cautious. He'll do, until someone with the will takes over."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two nodded. They'd discussed this. Even so, Zedalien looked wan. He closed his eyes as they reached another set of fortified ironwood doors. The keep that had been built for the House of El had been fashioned as a grand living space, fortification, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; workshop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Master crafters and artisans that had rivaled the Dwarves. Some of that remained. But so little. The half-Elf, who had been hired in the tradition of the El family—hiring half-Elves for their personal aides and servants—looked at the third head of the House of the El he had served. And he knew it was her time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And his.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I believe I will tender my resignation, once Lord Deilan is comfortable in his office, Lady Maviola. It has been an honor. Until that moment…I hope to serve you as faithfully as my father."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all he said. The old lady snorted as he opened the workshop doors. But fondly. Sadly. She reached out and touched his hand as he paused to bend and bow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Half-Elves. Hearts like glass. But loyal, so loyal. You should have never stayed to watch me grow old."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The doors opened as the half-Elf straightened. And he silently wheeled Lady Maviola into the workshop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was empty for the moment. The artisans employed and [Mages] were not needed. Their work was finished. A [Lord] stood in the room. But he had on a workman's vest. And he was holding a curious stick. A rod, rather, with a curious little button on the side. When he saw Maviola and Zedalien, he bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Maviola."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Deilan. The products are finished. How goes the negotiations?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman sat up in her wheelchair, looking at the [Lord]. Lord Deilan was a member of the House of El, but he kept to their old ways. He was a [Lord], but an [Artisan] as well, one who worked with magic and material. It was the reason he was going to be the next leader of the House of El. He was thirty six years old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he was a bit pretentious. A bit…enamored with the House of El's legacy. But he did know the work. And as he straightened, Maviola saw his expression darken. No platitudes about the craftsmanship of their goods from him now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Poorly, Maviola. There is no interest."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman took the news with steady acceptance. Just a grimace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wistram fell through? And the Iron Vanguard? And…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It seems the [Mages] have something to occupy their interests, Lady Maviola. I was in negotiations with Archmage Nailihuaile just last week, but suddenly—she's no longer interested. And the other buyers…the same."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But why? Two hundred blades we made. And no one will buy a one?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Pained, the elderly woman gestured at the object that Deilan was holding. He handed it to her and she held it carefully. She pressed on the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was a &lt;em&gt;click. &lt;/em&gt;The blade was attached to a bit of spring-loaded metal. It shot out from the concealed hiding spot. A rod of metal, rather than a blade, even. But as it extended, there was a flash of light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A glittering, red-green blade made of magic, transparent at the edges, appeared. Lady Maviola regarded it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A glowing, magical edge, shaped like a sword's blade. But light! Light enough even for her!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kaalblades. Artifacts, &lt;em&gt;crafted&lt;/em&gt; artifacts from another era. We put all our resources into it. All we could spare. It's a weapon fit for—and they said no?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Deilan shook his head. He regarded another of the finished Kaalblades. He activated it and carefully cut the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This could cut through most mundane metals, and even weaker enchantments! Not as smooth as butter, but the sharpness of the blade! If only it didn't run out of power…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Maviola looked at Deilan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You told me, Deilan. So the individual adventurers? [Merchants] wouldn't buy because…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Adventurers don't want to pay for mana stones, Lady Maviola. If they were cheaper on the market, perhaps—but as it stood, no [Merchant] would pay our prices. And I went as low as you would allow…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola disengaged the magical blade. She bowed her head as Zedalien gently took the weapon. Or tried to. The old lady hung on. When she raised her gaze, her eyes were shimmering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With tears. It was so unexpected that both the half-Elf and [Lord] averted their gaze. But Maviola just brushed at the tears, as if surprised they were there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I've failed you, Deilan. I hoped I could leave you with the profits from something. But it's just another venture…Fulviolo had a gift for knowing what would sell. I do not. I've made your job harder, when I should have left alone. My arrogance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady M—Great Aunt. Nothing could be further from the truth."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Deilan sank to one knee in the workshop. The old woman smiled at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You lie well, Deilan. But let's not lie; this was an old [Lady]'s last folly. Keep them, Deilan. Hold onto them until you can find a buyer. Don't sell them cheaply, mind. We can afford to tighten our belts another generation if need be. Or rather, you can."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord]'s gentle grip on Maviola's hands tightened for a moment. He blinked at her, around the grime on his face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You mean…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is not official. I may announce it later this week. But it is &lt;em&gt;time.&lt;/em&gt; You will be the next patriarch of the House of El. Zedalien is my witness. Has been for months now, despite the squabbling. I am done, Deilan. It is time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman reached out. The [Lord]'s grip was tight—before he remembered and released. Slight bruises were already appearing on Maviola's hands, and he turned red with shame. But Zedalien was already opening a healing potion. And Maviola took no notice. She reached out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do well, Deilan. Listen to Zedalien. And try to avoid Goblin Kings. You're a bit arrogant. But that's good. Just lead us well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;His eyes were shining with tears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Great Aunt, I will. I swear it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A smile. And for a moment, she was young again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good. Time enough for ceremony later. I don't know how I'll do it. Part of me wants to just—vanish. Keep the idiots guessing and let you fight to take charge. But I won't, I think. Stop crying, young man. I've been planning my end for over a decade. Stubbornness kept me around."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And now I'm to be…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] stared, suddenly aware of his burdens, for all he had coveted the power. And like that, the drama involving the House of El's succession came to a close. Maviola El smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why do you think I've had you negotiating and taking my job for the last two years, Deilan? Ah, well, we will discuss the rest before I go. Not much to say, really; Zedalien knows my job. And he will be with you for a year or two."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Deilan looked at Zedalien. The half-Elf bowed slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I plan to retire myself with Lady Maviola's…retirement, Lord Deilan. I have not the heart for another generation. But I will accompany you until my replacement is ready and you are secure in your post."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. Of course. You have my thanks. And—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Deilan looked at the old woman. And it struck him. There went Maviola El. And Zedalien. Two of the House of El's oldest members. And here he saw. He trembled. But his spine straightened. And Maviola saw and approved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not just yet would the Five Families slip away. &lt;em&gt;Not yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady El. A [Message] from Lady Magnolia Reinhart."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Later, as Lord Deilan was sitting in the study with Maviola, asking what questions needed asking, and avoiding discussion of what came next for her…the old woman looked up. Zedalien had a [Message] spell in his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm? It must be urgent. She's not normally so direct otherwise. Let me see. Ah—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola's brow wrinkled. Deilan looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Great Aunt? Is something…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A troubled look crossed the matriarch's brow, and then vanished. In fact, Maviola's gaze almost looked—relieved. Or happy? She nodded at Deilan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nothing that need concern you, Deilan. A [Lady]'s business. Just like you [Lords] and your clubs. Magnolia has an issue. And of course, she's decided to take the lead on…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She paused, drumming her fingers on the armrest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reinhart. And what did the other [Ladies] say? No—Ulva Terland wouldn't accede no matter what. Veltras' get are terrified of Tyrion, although some might…Wellfar?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked at Zedalien. The half-Elf bowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Refusals, Lady El. At least to move in concert. So Lady Magnolia has come to you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Does she think I won't survive the trip? Well—I might not. But for this? Yes. Ulva is a proud idiot."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola winced at the brutal acknowledgement. Briskly, she shook her head. Then she paused again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It should be done. I can send…no. It's very fitting. Tell Magnolia I will accede. But not without something in return."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked directly at Zedalien. The half-Elf paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What should I relay to Lady Magnolia?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman felt at her side. For…three objects. She clutched them urgently, as she sometimes did. Only, now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now.&lt;/em&gt; She felt a specter at her back. Not yet. &lt;em&gt;Not yet.&lt;/em&gt; The fire was dim. And Lord Deilan, heir to the House of El, looked at the old woman as she bared her teeth. She stared at Zedalien.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Tell her…tell her I have a price. As the El family has always done, we serve our clients and our interests. Let her give it to me. And Deilan?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Great Aunt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman smiled at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's make the most of today. Because when you become our House's leader, I will not be there."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And he saw her breathing shallowly. The effort of even telling a story had taken a toll on her. And the [Lord] bowed his head and spent his last hours with Maviola El well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some people said that all roads led to Invrisil. And those people were idiots because that was just geographically untrue. But it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; true that Invrisil occupied a bit of prime real estate when it came to trade routes. So the City of Adventurers was a meeting point for people on the road, adventurers going on an…adventure, and so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;All sorts went to Invrisil. Literally everyone, from peasants to [Lords]. Although only people in some kingdoms in Terandria got the [Peasant] class. But so many people were heading that way, or arriving, leaving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Runner jogged north on the road to Invrisil. They moved quickly, faster on average than the wagons or other modes of transport. They were slower than a horse, but they could go off-road and with potions, even a relatively fit Human could hope to outdistance a horse over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;As they ran, they passed by a number of sights. Overturned wagons with people shouting about a sudden [Bandit] attack. An entire family moving north after their home had been burned due to a freak accident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Some [Wagon Driver] in a wagon, grumbling about an obnoxious group he'd hauled down south to Invrisil as a favor. A group of adventurers, arguing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Don't eat half-cooked eggs!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Two of them were lying on the ground. One of them, an Antinium, was perfectly healthy thanks to his anti-food poisoning amulet. The other two had been throwing up all day. An exasperated woman with silver arms was berating them. The Antinium was debating taking off the amulet so he could get food poisoning in solidarity. But they still had a ways to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the Runner was faster than all the rest. People stared as he flashed past them. Some waved or called out. After all, it wasn't often you saw someone like him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A Courier. But also—a Beastkin. A Rabbit Beastkin. He had rabbit ears. A furry body. Muscles. He was in fact—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk. He paused to stare at the Horns of Hammerad, but he was on the job and he couldn't take time to socialize. Further north he ran, stopping only occasionally, with the attacked wagons, and then only promising to relay word to the nearest patrol or settlement. Which he did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he ran. And he was &lt;em&gt;quick.&lt;/em&gt; The average Runner could hope to outdistance a horse with some cheap stamina potions over a day. Hawk could outrun most horses on the gallop without trying. And he was a Courier. One of the best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Courier on delivery!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The familiar bellow came from the Rabbitman's mouth as he neared the gates of Invrisil. The [Guards] at the gate had an option as they saw Hawk approaching. They could stop him. Or—wave him through. Hawk had all the identification he needed in case they made a random stop. But that seldom happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No one stopped him in this case. Hawk raced past the [Guards], shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Wagon back sixteen miles south! [Bandit] attack!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Thanks! Noted!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sergeant] on duty bellowed back. She scrambled for a quill as she remarked to her companion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sixteen miles? He says it like it's &lt;em&gt;easy.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Couriers. You ever get a delivery from one of them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup. Placed an order and it appeared like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. All the way from First Landing! Costs more'n I'd care to ever spend, though."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Sergeant] looked at her comrade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So why'd you buy anything?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He waggled a finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wedding ring. Custom-made. Courier service."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. For Miski."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yup."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'd have been happy with a silver band."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Sergeant], we're on duty—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Drama. Hawk picked up the last of that conversation and really wished he'd stuck around to hear the rest. Not that you had to guess. But it would have been great gossip material for Selys when he got back to Liscor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbit [Courier] was humming to himself. And that was his class. Delivery was his specialty. He was conscious of the looks he got even as he entered Invrisil, but he weaved through the crowd with practiced grace. If he'd been in a real hurry, he might have shouted; Couriers could actually demand people get out of the way sometimes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But he wasn't in a &lt;em&gt;rush&lt;/em&gt;, rush. He'd only run, oh, the last two hundred miles at a decent pace. Even so, he'd beaten almost any conceivable mode of transport to get here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Courier delivery! I have a bag of holding and items from Pallass!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbit Beastkin announced as he entered Invrisil's Runner's Guild. It was one of the largest in the nation and they had a separate section for Couriers. A [Receptionist] raced over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hawk of Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's me. I have some Courier-letters, two priority sendings—one bound for the Players of Celum from…er, the Players of Celum in Liscor. Paper, fragile. This container here. I have eight other items…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Each one properly accounted for in his bag of holding. Each one Hawk signed for and got a receipt for; Courier-class deliveries were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lost in the system. The [Receptionist] was good at his job. Although he did pause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"A delivery to the Players of Celum? You mean, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Players?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The [Actors]? Yeah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk gave the Human man a blank look. He'd been to Invrisil and obviously knew the buzz about them, but he'd seen enough plays back in Liscor. But the man's reaction made Hawk do a double-take.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's marked as urgent, but they're not paying for in-person delivery. Just bulk transit. Is a regular runner okay?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Receptionist] hesitated and chewed it over. Hawk glanced around and noticed the other Runners in the guild were staring at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, he was a Courier, but it wasn't a rare sight to see a Courier in the Runner's Guild in Invrisil. Another city, yes. But they were staring &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; the bundles of paper. Hawk hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The—a City Runner or Street Runner would have to go with an escort to get it to the Players of Celum, I think, Courier Hawk. Are those…new &lt;em&gt;plays?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Maybe. I didn't ask."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk saw the [Receptionist]'s face light up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt; They're all the rage. I can call for an escort! And go myself! I'm a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fan of—did you say there's another group of the Players of Celum? Why in Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man reached for the papers, but Hawk grabbed them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…I may deliver this one in person rather than entrust it to a Street Runner, then. I'll take directions to the Players of Celum if you know where they are?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The disappointed man gave them to Hawk. He tried to ask about the Players of Celum in Liscor, and why were plays coming &lt;em&gt;here?&lt;/em&gt; And wouldn't Hawk consider an escort of his own? But Hawk ignored the questions as he backed up, stowing the papers and plotting a route towards the inn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He didn't gossip on the job. That was unprofessional. As he trotted towards the door with long strides, someone came over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hawk the Courier? I could take the papers for—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The City Runner hesitated. He ran after Hawk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm a huge fan of Miss Jasi. If we could say we went together, I could pay—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How popular were these [Actors]? &lt;/em&gt;Hawk accelerated, but the City Runner kept pace with him. He had a running Skill too. In fact—more Runners were following his lead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Mister Hawk! I'm Divee! We met once—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hello? Hawk? &lt;em&gt;Hello.&lt;/em&gt; I know you. We're from the same city. Sort of. I'm from Celum. The name is Pers—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Got to go! Get lost, City Runners!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk &lt;em&gt;accelerated&lt;/em&gt;. The Runners were left almost literally in a cloud of dust. They couldn't keep up with the Beastkin's agility. And Hawk was double-timing it now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Courier on delivery! Watch out!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He warned people as he ran and literally leapt over a group of people. All of Hawk's instincts had been triggered by that scene in the guild. He just &lt;em&gt;bet&lt;/em&gt; someone would have intercepted him to take this apparently &lt;em&gt;ultra-precious cargo&lt;/em&gt; if he'd dallied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fortunately, the inn wasn't that far away. Hawk made it there in a flash. The [Bouncer] at the door stared at the Rabbit Beastkin, but he blocked the door when Hawk pounded on it. There was actually a crowd outside the inn!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No one's allowed inside but—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Courier on delivery! &lt;/em&gt;For the Players of Celum! It says—Wesle, Jasi, or Emme."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk bellowed it in his ears and for the benefit of anyone inside. The [Bouncer] backed up. Someone exclaimed from inside and Hawk found a somewhat familiar half-Dwarf woman staring at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hawk?&lt;/em&gt; A Courier delivery? Oh—dead gods, it's Miss Erin's notes and that new play she remembered! Or is it the adaptation of…? Come in! Let him in, Redit!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Bouncer] was hurried out of the way. Hawk found Emme gesturing to him to put the papers on the table. Hawk did so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Emme, right? I can use that in my receipt to the Runner's Guild. Does everything check out to you? Everything you expected is in order?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, yes, absolutely. Temile's, hah, even included his new roster! Levels and names and all! Even species! He's got a &lt;em&gt;Garuda&lt;/em&gt;? We have to get that door active! Did you have a hard time getting here, Hawk? How's Erin? How's Liscor?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Fine. But I didn't know everyone and their dog would want to see the papers. You need to request in-person delivery, Emme."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Producer] blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We do? I mean, it was cheaper this way—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She saw an annoyed furry face and furry finger pointing at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I could have left it at the Runner's Guild and my job would have been done. Then you'd have had to gamble on someone else taking it here. City or Street Runners and I guarantee you that it would have been intercepted."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, I'm sorry—I had no idea! We've never done anything like Courier delivery before—can I get you a drink? Something to eat?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, it's fine. Consider it a one-time service, but you got lucky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mollified, Hawk accepted a drink. He was thirsty. Emme fussed around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're really very grateful. Can I offer you some of these? As thanks? We have a whole set."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She produced a set of signed pieces of colorful cardboard. Some were white, with gilding around the edges, others were more stylized. Black, with a white signature. Or gold. Hawk blinked at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What are these?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Signatures of the Players of Celum. Go on, take them. They're worth a bit, actually. They're performing right now, but Wesle and the others would love to see you. They'd clear their schedules for it, absolutely!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk…hadn't really ever talked to the Players of Celum. He had only visited The Wandering Inn a few times. And it was somewhat odd—Emme was inviting &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; as if it were her doing a Courier a favor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll uh, think about it. I'm heading back south Liscor's way anyways. This is just a short trip."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;So I can see Selys again.&lt;/em&gt; The Rabbitman was happy just thinking about it. Back together with Selys! She was always nice. And now she was a [Heiress], they were really connecting. They could go out to some places in Pallass, and Erin had that amazing carrot-stuff…life was good. Hawk wasn't poor by any means, and he'd rather just do easy deliveries and get back to Selys—it was too soon to think about rings, by far, but he &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; Selys—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? Well—did you see the Horns of Hammerad on the road? Because they have the magical door to Invrisil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk choked on his drink, breaking out of his thoughts. He listened as Emme explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I saw them on the road thirty miles back. Throwing up. They're close—although the two [Mages] looked pretty dead. Stuff might have been coming out both ends, if you know what I mean."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ew. What from?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bad eggs. I think. If they're bringing the door here…damn, that might cut into my route and take."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk was frowning. This might actually be a problem. More so than Pallass to Liscor. Because Hawk was fine with losing money to avoid the &lt;em&gt;Bloodfields.&lt;/em&gt; He'd have to have a word with Erin about it…Emme was trying to explain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No, it's fine, Hawk. The door won't be able to take more than one or two people, like Pallass."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes it will. Erin's added a Sage's Grass field and the door can ferry as many as twenty people pretty quickly. It recharges fast."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbit Beastkin explained as much as he could. He grimaced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I…could get the Horns. Or pick up the door, I guess. But…maybe not. I'm going to have to talk to Erin. This could hurt Runners across Izril."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The half-Dwarf woman sighed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's fair. But the Horns are close by the sounds of it. Meanwhile, we could pay you for an uh, direct-delivery to The Players of Celum in Liscor. We have a few of Andel's new plays and the Mage's Guild charges &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; too much to copy them properly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Direct delivery?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sure. How much is it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk hesitated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…There's a difference between delivery on-the-way and a custom order. I could give you on-the-way fares since I'm headed back to Liscor, but it would be at least six gold and eight silver? More if it's a lot or cumbersome."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The price was well outside the range of most people's budgets, but Emme didn't blink twice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We can do that. When are you headed back?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk perked up. This sounded good! Regular clients, or ones you had a personal relationship with were the bread and butter of every Courier's income. Then again—the door. Damn. He'd just have to ask Erin…well, maybe this was a matter for the Runner's Guild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbit Beastkin was of two opinions about the magical door. But he accepted the signatures. And the free drink. And he was looking forwards to a paid return trip—even if it was only one delivery—as he jogged back to the Runner's Guild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Players of Celum are delivered to."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Receptionist] gave Hawk a betrayed look. But he glumly signed Hawk off and gave the Rabbit Beastkin the money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So…you delivered to the Players? Did they give you any signatures? Do you have one of Jasi? Because I'll pay for them."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk wondered just how much the pieces of cardboard were &lt;em&gt;worth.&lt;/em&gt; But his senses were tingling that he had something valuable, so he just feigned ignorance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I dropped off the delivery. That's my job."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, well then. Here's your money."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbitman was just stowing the money when he saw a few Runners gathered about. They usually wanted to talk. Hawk gave them a wave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry about losing you. But you know how it is. Runner's Code."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They nodded, although in Hawk's experience, the Runner's code of conduct was a malleable thing. Still, each person had their standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Excuse me. You're &lt;em&gt;Hawk&lt;/em&gt;, right? I'm a huge fan. Persua. I think we've met?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk blinked at a young woman with a rather large smile which he was going to categorize as slightly insincere staring up at him. But she looked friendly and he nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Persua? I think I've heard of you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He couldn't remember from where, though. The young woman smiled wider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Actually&lt;/em&gt;, I'm from the south too. Celum. I'm a City Runner of course, but I'm in-training to become a Courier."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That made Hawk give her a second look. Any City Runner could become a Courier, but some were earmarked for the position because of the Skills they had, or natural talent, etc. She didn't look particularly athletic, so he guessed she had a Skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, I hope you make it. It's a bit dicey around here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Absolutely. &lt;/em&gt;Did you hear about Lacel the Leaper? He was intercepted while running a delivery to Lady Dealia! In the Player of Celum's inn!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk's fur stood up, although Persua didn't actually seem that bothered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I heard. Legs broken, right? I should pay a visit to him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh, he left the city. Wouldn't stay. But the package for Lady Dealia is still here."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Really? The Assassin's Guild didn't get it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, it was to send a message.&lt;/em&gt; Hawk remembered that a beat before Persua informed him of that fact. The word was all over Izril, especially the Runner's circles. The Guild of Assassins was back. Well, they'd never left, but now they were accepting contracts on Runners. And they'd done it in Magnolia Reinhart's own city. To a &lt;em&gt;Courier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'd better not sleep before I deliver the damn plays or whatever they are.&lt;/em&gt; Hawk resolved to himself as Persua cozied up to him. He reflexively stepped back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Too bad about Lacel. But he's only good when he's on the move. I'd love to chat, Miss Persua—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can't you stay? I'd love to get a drink, together. Ask about the Courier's lifestyle?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk hesitated. He eyed Persua, searching for the most amenable way out of the conversation. Did Persua know Ryoka? Or…Valceif? Hawk's stomach twisted. Poor fellow. He was about to ask when someone spoke up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hawk?&lt;/em&gt; Good timing! The lady said you'd be here! I need a word!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A loud voice. Hawk turned and saw another Courier striding his way. A Balerosian, at least in skin-tone, although Hawk happened to know this fellow was all-Izrilian to the core. The new speaker spread his arms wide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hawk! Don't hide! I'd recognize those ears anywhere!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And the fur? Good to see you Trit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk greeted Trit, or Tritel, was a stocky fellow. Short, rather good-natured, and surprisingly aggressive for his height. He was a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; fellow compared to Hawk, but he stomped on up and punched Hawk in the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You giant inconsiderate rabbit! I haven't seen you in ages! Where've you been? Around Liscor still?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's where I live."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk wasn't one of the more dramatic of personalities that made up a Courier. But Tritel…was. He had a very flatfooted walk, surprising among a runner, and he wasn't dressed in the loose clothing they liked. He had on boots, heavier clothing, and even wore a hat. He was also very short for a Runner, but it fit the way he travelled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was also a Courier. And he grabbed hold of Hawk's arm with surprising strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're coming with me. I need a word."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Trit—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No buts! I'll buy you a drink! Actually, I was just going to meet Salamani too. You heard about Lacel, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah. Salamani's here?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk was distracted. It was rare to find multiple Couriers, even in the city like Invrisil. They were always on the move. Tritel nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"He's here. On the same business as me. Come on, we're at this bar I like. So's Ci."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ci? They let her in there?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It's my favorite bar. Come on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Excuse me.&lt;/em&gt; I was talking with Hawk. Who are you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Persua blocked Tritel as he steered Hawk towards the door. The shorter man stared at Persua.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, Miss. Who're you? City Runner? Must be if I don't know your name. This is Courier's business. One side."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With that, he put a hand on her midriff since her shoulder was too high and shoved her out of the way. The outraged &lt;em&gt;squawk&lt;/em&gt; didn't even make Tritel break stride as they left the Guild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Was that someone you were interested in, Hawk? You could do better either way."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No. Not my type. Also, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; someone I'm seeing. I want to get her a gift, Trit. If this is going to take long…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Relax, &lt;em&gt;relax&lt;/em&gt;. I forgot. Nothing without scales for my fur-friend. I know Invrisil. I'll help you get her the best gift before we go. There's these new song-crystals that are all the rage. From Terandria."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Before &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; go?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk didn't miss that. He narrowed his eyes, but Tritel had a grip on him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come on, it won't take long to explain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He led the Rabbitman down the street. Hawk sighed, but he followed Tritel—you had to trust fellow Couriers. Well, some of them. And Tritel was good, if pushy. As the two walked on, they heard a group arguing. Young men and women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do you &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;, we're out of money?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Rose was shouting at Joseph. He flung up his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't know! She said it would last until Liscor! It's not my fault you all kept buying &lt;em&gt;snacks&lt;/em&gt;! And tipping!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have to tip people! What do we do? Send her a [Message]?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Kids these days."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel shook his head as he led Hawk past. The Rabbitman felt a bit sympathetic; it was a common scene, kids coming to Invrisil and losing all their money. He wasn't about to give them any, anyways. But even so…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The bar that Tritel liked so much wasn't…the best. It wasn't &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but it had that 'live and let live' attitude towards its clientele. Drinks were cheap, and the owner accommodating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Very accommodating. Hawk spotted Ci and Salamani by the bar. He would have recognized them at once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani because the Human was a fellow Courier. Only—his clothing was &lt;em&gt;silk&lt;/em&gt;, and had the embellishments most [Mages] loved to put on everything. As he turned to greet the other two Couriers, part of his heritage became obvious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani was descended from a Lizardman and a Human woman. Fertility spells made the cross-species birth work, but as often happened, there was a bit of mixing of genetics. In this case—Salamani's only nod to his other half was his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were vertical slits, like a lizard's. But the man was normal in every respect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hawk! Tritel said you'd be coming."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Coming? For what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I didn't say. Hi, Salamani. Thanks for keeping my place, Ci."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel greeted the fourth person at the bar. He got a snort in reply. Hawk glanced over at Ci, whom he was also familiar with. And…part of the 'live and let live' atmosphere of the bar was added to by Ci's presence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was a horse. A white mare, some exquisite Terandrian breed. Hawk didn't know horses well, but even he could tell Ci was a horse among horses. She was also standing at the bar and drinking out of a bowl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Is that alcohol?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. You think Ci's drinking water?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel gave Hawk an odd look. The Rabbit Beastkin was doing the same, but that was Tritel. The short man was one of the mounted Couriers. And he and Ci were a pair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What's this about, you two?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sit down. Have a drink. But nothing stiff."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk didn't like the friendly way the other two Couriers were glancing at him. Tritel had a stiffer drink than the other two, but then—he didn't run. And Salamani was drinking milk. Hawk's senses began to tingle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So—Lacel the Leaper got his legs broken. That fat idiot probably thought no one would stop him at night in a fancy inn. Thing is, the Assassin's Guild is off Reinhart's leash. And Lacel didn't even get the damn amulet that may or may not be Lord Bein's stolen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel spoke cheerfully, not bothering to lower his voice. The two Couriers listened. Hawk ordered some juice. Ci gave him a sideways look with one of her eyes. He waved at her. Tritel got mad if you didn't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It was a message. The Assassin's Guild is back. We've all got to start sleeping with one eye open again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani grumbled. Hawk nodded. It wasn't good, but prices would go up with the danger. It was life. Tritel was nodding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yeah, but the thing is—the delivery could still be done. In fact, some people reckon it &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be done. Because the Assassin's Guild might be back—but that was a Courier's job. And we don't fail. Not even if all the Demons in hell were chasing us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He gave the other two a sideways look. Hawk instantly stood up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That sounds great. But you know what? I uh, have the important delivery I have to do. For the Players of Celum."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Players of Celum? You wouldn't happen to know them, would you? I'd pay for a signature!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani perked up. Hawk reached for one of the monogrammed autographs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Take it, Salamani. I'm going to—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not so fast, Hawk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbitman stared at the hoof in front of his chest. He stared at Ci. To his relief, he realized it was Tritel who'd spoken. The [Rider] was motioning him to sit back down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is a matter of pride. The Assassin's Guild made its mark. We make ours. Runners will deliver that package to Lady Dealia, even if Lord Bein puts a hundred thousand gold piece bounty on our heads."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not if Lady Hetessana doesn't pay us. And that's a personal choice. Excuse me, Ci—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mare snorted and gave Hawk a &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;. He hesitated. Tritel had a [Beast Tamer] class, or something close. And Ci was as intelligent as animals got. He slowly backed away to his seat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know, it's about money. But this is different, Hawk. Hetessana's raised the price of delivery."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even so—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Three of us are going to deliver the package. And if the fee's not enough for you, it's being doubled. &lt;em&gt;To send a message.&lt;/em&gt; And you know who's doubling it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk hesitated. He had a bad feeling. He glanced over the bar. He could jump over it, burst out the back door, and be gone even if Ci and Salamani tried to stop him. Hawk was a cautious Courier, as they went. He did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; risk his life. Not with the Goblin Lord's army, not with anything else. He tensed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm sorry, Tritel. But even for twice that, or four times—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Guildmistress Godfrey wants it done, Hawk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani spoke up for the first time. He was lovingly staring at the autograph that had some of Jasi's lipstick and signature on it. Hawk paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She…does?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's right. Mihaela herself. And she knew you were coming north, Hawk. You're in on the delivery. All three of us going together. It'll be safer. Not even hard with three of us. But you're in it. Or you get to explain yourself to First Landing's Guildmistress. And you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; her."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk did. He hesitated. If it had been Tritel or Salamani asking him, he'd already be running for the gates. But…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mihaela Godfrey.&lt;/em&gt; One of the most famous Couriers to ever run across Izril. Guildmistress and rarely active Courier of First Landing's Runner's Guild.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mother of Valceif Godfrey. Tritel raised his glass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's not in a good mood, Hawk. You know how she's normally? Double that, and then double that. You can run off and we'll do it alone. But she'll pull off your ears and tail if you get within a hundred miles of First Landing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Rabbit Beastkin hesitated. He had a healthy self-respect for his life. He wasn't an adventurer. Being a Courier was &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt;, but he didn't take suicide missions. He weighed the dangers of going against the Assassin's Guild to deliver the amulet with Tritel and Salamani versus Mihaela Godfrey's wrath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hate you both."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He sat back down. Tritel grinned and raised his cup before draining it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you think she gave &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; a choice?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Soonest done, soonest ended. The Assassin's Guild has rules. We get the amulet to Lady Dealia, they lay off."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And if they don't?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then all bets are off and it's war. And I bet even the [Assassins] will think twice before going up against all the Couriers in Izril. Or Mihaela. She's squashed a hundred times more Ants than I have [Bandits]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani drained his cup. Tritel nodded. He slapped Ci on the side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Drink up, girl. We're about to do some &lt;em&gt;work.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mare snorted alcoholic fumes all over Tritel. He laughed. Hawk pushed back his drink. &lt;em&gt;He shouldn't have come to Invrisil. Damn, damn—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The amulet of Lord Bein's sat in the Runner's Guild. Lord Bein was on the way himself to pick it up. &lt;em&gt;Not that it was actually his amulet! More like a clever fake!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Hetessana's claim of her relationship with Lord Bein was in jeopardy. Lady Dealia had sworn vengeance if it turned out Lord Bein had been unfaithful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the concrete 'proof' of all this lay in Invrisil's Runner's Guild. Hawk grumbled as the three Couriers walked through the doors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Can't they make Lord Bein swear on a truth spell?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, but that would be dishonorable and crap. Or he might refuse. This is how the nobles play, Hawk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel laughed. Ci trotted through the doors after him, ignoring the looks she got. Tritel strode up towards the counter where the [Receptionist] was giving him a very long look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. We're here for the amulet of Lord Bein. Or Lady Hetessana's delivery. Whatever. You know what it is."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The words provoked a silence around the guild. Everyone turned to look. Hawk wondered if there were any [Assassins] here. There had to be. Informants at least. He looked around nervously. But he was committed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The—the amulet? You three are…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Receptionist]'s eyes went round. Someone immediately ran out the side doors. Hawk turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Easy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani looked relaxed as he limbered up. The [Mage], who was also a [Runner], nodded. As Tritel leaned over the counter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You got word from First Landing. The amulet. Give it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You're a [Receptionist]. &lt;em&gt;We're&lt;/em&gt; the Couriers. Hand it over. Or—Ci?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel was too short to reach over the counter. So Ci, the horse, leaned over and &lt;em&gt;clicked&lt;/em&gt; her teeth in front of the [Receptionist]'s face. The man backed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'll—I'll get it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Good. Did someone spread the word, Hawk?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"There's a crowd gathering. Tritel…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Don't worry. Salamani's going to cast on us before we leave the doors. I doubt they'll get us before we leave the city. If they do—improvise. I'll take it. Unless one of you want it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"No."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nope."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel nodded. He patted Ci's flank as the mare snorted. She could sense the mood in the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Anyways, Mihaela wants a crowd. There's the amulet. Let's roll."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Receptionist] had it in a box. He unlocked it with a secret passphrase and key as the Couriers waited. Hawk was dancing from foot to foot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are we doing this &lt;em&gt;now?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You want to take a nap like Lacel? Yep, here it is. Nice looking, right?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel dangled the locket at the other two. Salamani leaned in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…Looks genuine. There'll be hell to pay once we deliver it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If. You mean, &lt;em&gt;if.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hawk, you're the most terrified giant rabbit I've ever met. Relax. You're a Courier. Let's do this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three Couriers walked out of Invrisil's Runner's Guild into a crowd. Everyone in earshot had rushed to see them when they'd heard. Tritel waved as he mounted onto Ci's saddle. Salamani produced a wand and bowed with a flourish. He'd already cast some spells on Hawk and Ci, to Hawk's relief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hey everyone! We're delivering Lord Bein's damn amulet! Or Lady Hetessana's gift! Fuck, it might be fake! But we're doing it and no [Assassins] are going to stop us! Because we're &lt;/em&gt;Couriers!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel bellowed. The crowd cheered. The Guild of Assassins produced worried looks and stares, but most just cheered. And even Hawk stopped his nervous pacing to wave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because it was true. He'd realized the same thing the other Couriers had. The Assassins' Guild had a choice. If they went after Couriers on the run, it was one thing. But if they made it personal, it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; war. Hawk, Salamani, and Tritel just had to believe that they were out of the crosshairs once they delivered the amulet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So it was a contest. One with the Courier's lives on the line and the finish line was Lady Dealia. Until then? All bets were off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But that was how they lived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three—no, four of Izril's fastest Runners walked towards the gates. And—if the Players of Celum were famous, their fame was newly-won. A fad that might become permanent. But here were &lt;em&gt;Couriers.&lt;/em&gt; And even the Players were in the crowd that followed them out of the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Invrisil's people followed the four. And they began to shout. Because the first, the original celebrities of Izril weren't just adventurers. In fact—you saw these ones more often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk. The Rabbit Beastkin was trembling with nerves. But the people were shouting his name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hawk! Hawk the Hare! The Hare of Liscor!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I hate that name!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk shouted back. Salamani laughed. He raised a wand, flicking it out of a wrist-holster. And the [Mage Runner] got his own cheer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Salamani the Haste Mage!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Last was Ci. Also, Tritel was riding her. He adjusted the strings holding his hat to his head. And the short man flicked out a crossbow. A newfangled weapon, not as good as bows. Or as honorable. And Ci reared and he laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tritel the Moonlight Rider, and Ci, the Silver Mare of Izril.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ready?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel grinned, with that wild adrenaline coursing through his veins. Hawk nodded tightly. Salamani whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Haste]. &lt;/em&gt;Let's do this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Alright. One, two, three, &lt;em&gt;go!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Couriers exploded out of the gates to wild cheers from the crowd behind them. They &lt;em&gt;ran&lt;/em&gt;. Hawk's arms and legs were pumping and Salamani was right next to him. The [Mage] was whispering spells as he ran. One of Wistram's graduates had taken to running. And Tritel and Ci?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They stormed ahead. Ci's silver mane and tail flashed in the sun as she &lt;em&gt;accelerated&lt;/em&gt;. Tritel was laughing and riding low along her back. Hawk saw them gaining away and increased his pace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Move it, you slow rats!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The four shot down the road like an arrow, and they weren't even at full speed yet. Heads turned on the road as they shot north and east. People began to move out of the way, but the Couriers surged right, off the road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;We're not stopping until we get to Lady Dealia! She's north and east of here! We'll go by Reizmelt's way!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel was the only one with breath to bellow. The wind snatched away his voice as he pointed. Hawk just ran. Faster and faster, gulping oxygen, feeling his muscles explode with energy. And he saw Salamani grinning as the [Mage] ran. Hawk couldn't resist a smile. After all, they were Runners. And Hawk liked his job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three Couriers were taking on the contract. Word spread from Invrisil like wildfire. But it was barely faster than they were, even with [Message] spell and the speed of drama. In fact—Lord Bein and his escort were riding towards Invrisil when they got the news.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From the north, heading south. After trying to reassure Lady Dealia that this was all a complete misunderstanding, the young [Lord] had been making haste to recover the item in question. But he was too slow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Three Couriers?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man gave one of his family's retainers an incredulous look. He was riding with a large escort, as befitted a member of the Terland family. The [Captain of Horse] winced as the young Lord Bein raised his voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lord Terland. Three of them have taken the contract. They're headed north. Hawk of Liscor, Salamani the Mage, and Tritel the Moonlight Rider."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On the very same trade route as Lord Bein. The young [Lord]'s mouth opened and closed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But there's a bounty on their heads. The Assassin's Guild got Lacel the Leaper! Didn't they receive the—the message?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lord Bein. But—they're &lt;em&gt;Couriers.&lt;/em&gt; I believe the Runner's Guild is sending a message."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They can't do that!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] bit his tongue on the fact that they could and were. And at that moment—one of his [Riders] pelted down the road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lord Bein! The Couriers are headed this way!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? No—that's excellent! [Captain], marshal your men! We'll force them to stop. With me!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Bein reached for a sword and the [Captain] panicked. Because he knew Couriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lord Bein, I would not advise that!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the [Lordling] was already shouting at the escort. They were sizable in number; to fight off attacks and possible kidnapping attempts, nearly a hundred of Terland's private guards were accompanying Lord Bein. They were also of a decent level and armed with good steel. They looked up as Lord Bein shouted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Spread out! Block the road! No one goes around!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The escort spread out slowly. The other travellers on the road, already forced wide of the Terland group, were forced to stop as the [Soldiers] deployed with efficiency. Travellers backed up. But the [Captain] was arguing with Lord Bein, urgently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lord Bein.&lt;/em&gt; My job is to keep you safe and to obey your orders!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I cannot keep you safe if we attempt to stop the Couriers! Not three of them!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Keep &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; safe?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The young man looked astonished. Then he saw the [Captain] nervously glancing down the road. And there they were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The first thing Lord Bein saw was a distant cloud. No—a dust cloud, chained to the earth. It was rippling their way, against the wind. And then he realized. It was following the Couriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They were just specks in the distance. Lord Bein stared. So did the people on the road. Some began to cheer. Because &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; Couriers running at max speed was a sight you only got to see once in a year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Captain! Stop them! &lt;em&gt;You, Couriers! Halt!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Bein grasped at a voice-amplifying stone. His voice cracked across the open trade road. &lt;em&gt;Loud&lt;/em&gt;; the [Soldiers] around him were deafened and clasped their hands to their helmets, swearing. But the distant figures didn't even stop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;I am Lord Bein Terland! By the House of Terland, I order you to halt and turn over my—turn over your illegal cargo! If you resist, my men will use force!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lord] howled. And he saw one of the distant Runners raise something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani the [Mage]. Lord Bein saw a flash of light. And then a spear of light shot at &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. It blasted about ten feet over his head. The [Lord] &lt;em&gt;ducked&lt;/em&gt; as his horse reared. The [Soldiers] stared as Lord Bein galloped behind their lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Captain!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Brace! Apprehend the Runners!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Horse Captain] was swearing and sweating. Lord Bein stared at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're not stopping!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're &lt;em&gt;Couriers&lt;/em&gt;, Lord Bein! They answer to no one on a delivery! Not even the Assassin's Guild!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] snapped, not in the mood to argue. Lord Bein turned pale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What? But they promised me—&lt;em&gt;stop them!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lord Bein shouted desperately. His escort braced. They had [Riders]. [Pikemen], who were laying down their long spears, ready to impale the Runners. But—the Couriers were just running at them, followed by that giant cloud of dust generated by the speed of their passage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Halt in the name of Lord Bein Terland!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of the [Soldiers] shouted desperately. The Couriers might have heard him, but they didn't stop. Instead, they sped &lt;em&gt;up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here we go! Let's not kill any of the escort!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel laughed as the three Couriers ran at the blockade. All three Runners saw the [Riders] racing around the lines of spears and infantry, moving to intercept. No [Archers] though, or [Mages] aiming at them; the [Captain of the Horse] was making a half-hearted effort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So the Couriers replied in kind. The [Mage] raised his wand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Invisibility]. [Flash Step]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani &lt;em&gt;vanished&lt;/em&gt;. Hawk saw a small explosion of dust as the [Mage] kicked off. The [Soldiers] lost him in an instant, unable to stop the invisible, hasted Runner. They looked around, shouting. And then saw Tritel and Ci riding &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was just one rider, on a horse. And they were behind a line of pikes. But Tritel never slowed. Ci raced along the ground, running silver, like her name. The Moonlight Rider had one hand on his hat and he was aiming straight &lt;em&gt;at &lt;/em&gt;Lord Bein.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Brace! &lt;em&gt;[Pikewall Formation]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Captain] was covering Lord Bein as he saw the [Rider] shooting towards the line of pikes. And still—Tritel didn't adjust his course. He was going to ride &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the pikes with Ci! The [Soldiers] stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then, just before he reached the wall of pikes, the [Rider] pointed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ci! &lt;em&gt;[Gazelle's Leap]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel roared. Ci &lt;em&gt;leapt&lt;/em&gt; as the first ranks of spears approached. The [Soldiers] stared as the horse flew &lt;em&gt;up, up&lt;/em&gt; overhead. Tritel waved his hat in one hand, laughing. The horse cleared the escort, Lord Bein, and then Ci was landing, running, scattering clods of dirt. One hit Lord Bein in the head, just missing the young man's open mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The second Courier cleared the blockade. Tritel was laughing as Ci landed and shot forwards again. Salamani reappeared with a flourish, leaping over a stationary wagon. He front-flipped through the air, winking at the travellers stopped on the road. They went &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;, cheering as the two Couriers flashed past the stunned Lord Bein.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Showoffs.&lt;/em&gt; But that was a Courier. And as for Hawk?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He just ran around the [Soldiers] blocking the road. A dozen [Riders] tried to catch him, but he ran past them and the slower horses couldn't even turn fast enough to catch him. It was a blockade of a hundred soldiers. Just run &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; for a few seconds and you were clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it was a show. The Couriers rejoined their formation as they ran down the road. People were shouting, waving. And the Couriers kept going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did you see his face? Hah!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That was just the easy bit! Don't get a stuffed head!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk shouted back at Tritel. The [Rider] laughed and nodded. The hard part was to come. Because word was spreading. The Couriers were on the run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Two hours later, the real action began. Two hours was enough for the news to spread. From Invrisil, from the tweaking of Lord Bein's nose—the three Courier's delivery was making headlines. Or rather—it was appearing in scrying orbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They're headed this way!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Every Runner in Reizmelt had heard about the run. They were clustered around the Mage's Guild's scrying orb, staring at the projection. It was an aerial view of the three Runners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;It appears that three Couriers are attempting to complete the request. From Invrisil to—this is a Human drama, so we're not too up to date on the facts, folks. Lord Bein Terland? Who's that?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Noass was trying to cover the story, but the Drake was woefully out of touch. But everyone in the north knew the score. And one of them &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt; at the Rabbitman who was racing alongside a…&lt;em&gt;[Mage]&lt;/em&gt; and a man on horseback.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Dead gods. Is that—Hawk?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka Griffin stared into the scrying orb at the three Runners. Well—for a moment. Even the spell was having trouble keeping up with their speed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hawk the Hare! There's &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; Couriers taking the delivery? Is it that dangerous?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Melodie was excitedly pointing into the scrying orb with all the City Runners. They were clustered around the orb, but a crowd was gathered, demanding to see. This was the kind of drama that occupied Izril's consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Who're the other two?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other City Runners stared at Ryoka. Todel blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ryoka, you don't know them? That's Salamani, the [Haste] Mage! And Tritel and Ci! The Moonlight Duo! The Moonlight Rider?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ryoka gave him a blank look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sorry, I know Hawk, but the others don't come near Celum."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not often, but they're &lt;em&gt;Couriers!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And they're passing by Reizmelt! They have to be if they're heading north—this is the most direct route! Look! They're nearly here! We might be able to see them! Let's go and see!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Caawl shouted excitedly. The other City Runners ran for the doors. So did Ryoka. She had to see this herself. And she saw the dust cloud headed towards Reizmelt. Ryoka stopped and stared. Even the wind was taking notice. She saw the City Runners milling about the southern gates and then heading towards the eastern ones. There was a blockade around the south gates. And—Ryoka ran out of the city. She saw the Couriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Holy cow. They're &lt;em&gt;moving!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had seen Charlay running. And other City Runners. But this? Ryoka ran, the wind at her back. She never caught up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Couriers saw Reizmelt in the distance. They were tiring. Two &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; of running at full speed was taking some of the wind out of their sails. But—they had stamina potions and mana potions in Salamani's case. Hawk pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Reizmelt! A break?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You tired, Hawk?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel laughed. Which was sort of unfair since Ci was doing all the hard work. The mare was running without looking fatigued at all. Hawk gave Tritel a hand-gesture and the man laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Straight through Reizmelt?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Couriers agreed. This was a show, after all. But as they approached the south gates—Salamani wavered. People were streaming out of the city from all the gates, waving. Other City Runners, shouting, trying to keep up. Most couldn't even catch the Couriers, let alone keep pace. Hawk saw a young woman with black hair he thought he recognized. But then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Dangersense]! &lt;em&gt;Go around!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani bellowed as he reappeared. Instantly, the three Couriers changed course, avoiding Reizmelt's gates. Hawk thought he saw a figure in black standing at the south gates. They were invitingly open. But the instant the [Mage] shouted, the Couriers made tracks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;What is it?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Assassins! They're on to us! Get ready!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani was pointing. Hawk saw the motionless figure for a moment as the Couriers ran &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, going wide of the city. They shot towards the road heading northeast out of Reizmelt. And Hawk felt it too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Danger.&lt;/em&gt; But the Couriers had avoided whoever that was. They kept running. And in Reizmelt, Ryoka slowed, panting. She wondered why the Couriers had suddenly changed course. She looked over her shoulder and saw—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The southern gates had been blocked and the City Runners hadn't been able to leave through them. And someone was standing there. Ryoka felt goose bumps erupting on her skin as she saw someone shrouded from head to toe in black. He was staring after the Couriers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Damn. They noticed. One of them must have perception Skills or spells. Perhaps Salamani. Tell the Guildmaster I'm done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Assassin] sighed. He pulled at one of the thin, invisible strands of steel he'd webbed the southern gates with. Sharp and thin enough to decapitate anyone moving at speed through the gates. If the Couriers had come through…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they hadn't. And the [Assassin], the master of wires and traps, wasn't really in this assignment. It was all show. He spoke to one of the disguised [Guards] who'd maintained the blockade to prevent anyone from killing themselves going through the gates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pack it up. I'm done."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You won't follow them?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The fake [Guard], one of the junior members of the Guild, looked startled, but knew better than to question a master. The [Trapmaster] yawned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Even &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; couldn't catch up with Couriers that fast. The [Assassin] lazily wound up the steel wires. He'd rather fight Magnolia Reinhart's servants than try to catch a Courier. They were the worst kind of prey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Dangersense] &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the speed and reflexes to instantly run away from trouble. How did you catch that? Well—he'd made some effort. The [Assassin] spoke curtly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm done. Fighting three Couriers is too much for anyone but a master. So. Send in the fodder. Maybe they'll get lucky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He walked off, taking off his signature clothing. &lt;em&gt;Silly politics. &lt;/em&gt;He'd enjoy taking down one of the Couriers if someone posted a personal bounty. Later. You didn't rush a proper assassination. He saw the junior [Assassins] scrambling. As numerous as flies. The [Trapmaster Assassin] shook his head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Well, that was the purpose of rookies. At least it would be interesting to watch. He wondered if he could find a scrying orb. He liked the Wistram broadcasts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Couriers had only a few minutes of relief after avoiding Reizmelt. They were headed north, halfway towards their destination when the real ambush began. It started with an unsettling empty patch of road. On a trade route, no less.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Couriers looked at each other. That almost never happened except when something was up. They glanced ahead as Salamani's magically enhanced vision spotted something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Carriages incoming! From ahead!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Here they come. Damn, damn, damn—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk saw nearly a dozen dark coaches speeding down the road. Tritel gritted his teeth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Salamani, escape or go through?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My [Dangersense] isn't tingling hard. Looks like lower-level enemies. Split up. We'll make it out the other side."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Couriers nodded at each other. They split, Hawk going right, Salamani left. Tritel continued down the road. And here came the first wave of [Assassins].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;In carriages. Not the legendary pink coach of Magnolia Reinhart, but clearly enchanted. Panting horses were flinging them across the ground, towards the Couriers. Some were approaching from the rear as well!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One pulled up from behind as the Couriers began to split up. Hawk saw Tritel pull out a crossbow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Courier on delivery! Back off!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He had to shout that. But the painted coach just gained in speed. &lt;em&gt;Definitely enchanted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The carriage doors opened, revealing dark-clothed figures all holding glittering metal. &lt;em&gt;Crossbows.&lt;/em&gt; Also, throwing weapons. They fired and threw their poisoned darts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a good ambush. More [Riders] on horseback with movement Skills were circling, trying to cut at the Couriers. And the coaches were coming from both directions. The [Assassins] had wands, and were firing lightning bolts, homing arrows—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was a good ambush. The kind that would get a City Runner, even the best of them. But a seasoned Courier? The [Assassins] were aiming at &lt;em&gt;Ci&lt;/em&gt;, thinking to take the rider off his mount. But Tritel was a high-level Rider. And he had a Skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Mount and Rider: Shared Skills]. The short man's teeth flashed as he howled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Flicker Dodge]! [Blinding Flash]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The horse &lt;em&gt;flickered&lt;/em&gt;. She reappeared to the left, neatly dodging all the projectiles. And then—Hawk was far enough to see only a flash. But it was bright enough to make him shade his eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ci's horseshoes and the metal on his clothing lit &lt;em&gt;up.&lt;/em&gt; The [Assassins] went blind, and cursed as even the horse and drivers lost their vision for a few crucial seconds. By the time they recovered, the Moonlight Mare and her rider were gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Assassins] chasing Salamani saw the [Mage Runner] had unsheathed his wand. He was using a [Haste] spell, and he'd turned [Invisible]. But some of them could see the invisibility, or track him through the grass and they surged towards his location. But the [Mage] wasn't just trying to hide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Arrows of Light, come to me in gathering storm!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Courier shouted as he raised his wand. He reappeared and lights flashed into existence around him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magical [Light Arrows], a Tier 1 spell began appearing around Salamani. But dozens with each &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;. They flew after the [Mage], like a vast cloud of light, spinning, weaving together. One hundred, two hundred, &lt;em&gt;three…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Assassins] wavered. And they understood too late why a master-assassin hadn't tried to stop all three Couriers. Beyond their speed, and disinterest in the contract—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was really &lt;em&gt;hard. &lt;/em&gt;Salamani charged with hundreds of magical arrows following in his wake. He ran towards a carriage and pointed. The [Light Arrow] storm engulfed the coach. Black shapes, horses, wood, all were struck hundreds of times by the spell. The coach &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; and the other [Assassins] peeled back, avoiding the deadly hail of magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani vanished again as the spell conjured more of the arrows. He was loosing more in every direction, exchanging fire with the [Assassins]. And a magical barrier was deflecting every crossbow bolt and poisoned dart that reached him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hurry up, Ci! They're on us!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel was being pursued by more [Assassins] on horseback. He'd dodged most of the coaches, but a few of the [Assassins] were able to catch up for a few seconds. One had a sabre and was riding hard at him. The [Rider] saw Ci accelerate and reached for his side. &lt;em&gt;His turn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Rope Trick]!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man flicked a long, enchanted rope out of his saddlebags. The [Assassin] wasn't prepared for that. They slashed wildly, but the rope twisted through the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel snagged one of the riding [Assassins] by the leg. He yanked them off their horse as Ci outdistanced the others. The [Assassin] hit the ground and was dragged behind Ci at insane speeds. He—no—she thrashed wildly for the first hundred feet, trying to cut the enchanted rope. After that, nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;After three hundred feet, Tritel undid the knot. There wasn't much left of the [Assassin] as the corpse rolled to a stop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;There was one last group of [Assassins] riding at him. Tritel ducked as a crossbow bolt flew past him. He swore as another hit him in the shoulder. But it didn't penetrate his enchanted clothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bastards! You alright, Ci?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The mare snorted. Her sides had deflected a few projectiles. Worried, Tritel checked her. She had an [Enhanced Hide] Skill, but she was bleeding. The [Rider] shouted in fury as he looked ahead at the [Riders] shooting at them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He pulled out a crossbow and fired once. The enchanted bolt detonated and blew a group of riders to bits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;That was a hundred gold bolt you bastards!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He shouted as he and Ci raced past. And they were clear. So was Salamani, whose magical arrow cloud had fought off his pursuers. And again—that only left—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He was still just running along. He hadn't slowed to fight and instead had just sped up. The other [Assassins] on wagon or horseback were having trouble even catching him. The Courier leapt over rocks and other obstacles, like, well, a &lt;em&gt;rabbit&lt;/em&gt;. He was maneuvering, keeping them from drawing close.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But you could only run so long. The [Assassins] chasing him suddenly stopped. A pair of carriages moved forwards, blocking his route. [Riders] from the left, closing in—and the carriages were opening, disgorging black-clad figures ahead. They were clambering on top of the roof, aiming weapons at him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh &lt;em&gt;shit!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk tried to swerve, but he was being boxed in. He saw [Riders] to the left, a group aiming wands with [Lightning Bolt] to the right—and the [Assassins] in the wagons ahead of him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Gaaaaaaaah!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;He screamed as the bolts flew and the [Assassins] rode through their own fire to strike at him. &lt;em&gt;Left—right—ahead&lt;/em&gt;—the Rabbit [Courier] shouted as he ran at the wagons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Physical Overdrive]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Assassins] saw him &lt;em&gt;blur&lt;/em&gt;. The ones braced blinked. He was coming even faster. &lt;em&gt;Twice as fast—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk leapt &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the first coach, a blur. [Assassins] drew their weapons. The others raced around, to trap—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Courier &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; out of the other side in less than a second. The destroyed coach and [Assassins] with broken bones &lt;em&gt;crashed&lt;/em&gt; to the ground around him. He hit the ground. And ran &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; a horse, an extended blade—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The world was in slow motion compared to the Beastkin Runner. He hit the ground and &lt;em&gt;sprinted&lt;/em&gt; past the carriage. For a second, five, ten, he was racing faster than anything around him. He caught &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; to Ci and Tritel as Salamani used [Flash Step] to close the gap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bleeding hells, Hawk! You don't mess around! Did you get tagged? Ci's hurt!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One of them scorched my ass! I'm going to kill you, Tritel!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk shouted at Tritel. Salamani was swearing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I think I'm poisoned! Hand me an antidote!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Slap some potion on Ci!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The three Couriers tossed potions and vials at each other on the run. They were nearly clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Assassins] made one last attempt. The fastest coach rocketed forwards. It was on a collision course! The Couriers stared at the wagon. Hawk raised a fist. Salamani pointed his wand and Tritel turned Ci after Hawk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Steelbreaker Punch]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Lightning Bolt]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;[Bull's Charge]!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The wagon exploded. The three Couriers raced forwards as debris landed around them. Tritel was shouting at the others as he took lead again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"[Wild Gallop]! We're nearly in the clear! Let's &lt;em&gt;go!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They left the [Assassins] behind. Salamani panted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They didn't send a master? We got lucky! We must have avoided the one I saw at Reizmelt."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Let's go off-road! We can't run another encounter! I'm already a hundred gold down plus the potions!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel pointed. They were headed towards the hills. That way led to monsters, rougher terrain. The Couriers didn't even think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Off-road! &lt;/em&gt;Salamani, lose whatever scrying spells are on us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm trying! I think it's Wistram! Let me send a [Message] spell. &lt;em&gt;Hey, cut it out! You're giving away our positions you—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"—&lt;em&gt;inbred, half&lt;/em&gt;–&lt;em&gt;baked [Seers] with all the sense of a slug! I'm a [Mage] of Wistram and your hedge-mage brains are getting me and my fellow Couriers ambushed! If you don't cancel that spell now, I'll run back to the Academy, find the idiot who thought it was a good idea to put a damned scrying spell on us when we have [Assassins] up our asses and rip their lungs out! Cancel that spell now you worthless, worm-addled—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The stream of invectives didn't slow for a good minute. The [Seer] receiving the spell kept wincing and looked at the [Diviner] in charge of the broadcast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Should we…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Um—cancel the scrying spell. And cut off Mage Salamani. He's made his point."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The man in charge coughed a few times. Salamani's oaths cut off. So was the image of the three Couriers, much to the disappointment of the viewers who instantly began sending &lt;em&gt;Noass&lt;/em&gt; angry [Message] spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But the point had been made. The Couriers had broken through one ambush. The Assassins' Guild had made a good attempt, but—not their best. Better to make the effort than do their best and still fail. The delivery was going to succeed. Unless…one of the master-assassins was willing to intercept?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;…No. They had a problem with being on the scrying orb. Besides, some of them got deliveries from Couriers. You didn't kill your favorite Runner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three Couriers. They kept running, and without any eyes on them, they could slow down. It was still a long way north. But they only took one break, once they'd reached the hills. They drank more stamina potions, bandaged wounds, excreted—and they were on the run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It wasn't pretty. In fact, apart from the adrenaline-inducing fights, their run was still &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;. Exhausting, hard—with moments of extreme danger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But they &lt;em&gt;ran.&lt;/em&gt; And finally, they reached the city of Weisel. By that point, the scrying spell had been reinstated, due to popular demand. Salamani was swearing a blue streak, but they were in range of the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Couriers on delivery! Where's Lady Dealia?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel raced forwards on Ci, shouting at the [Guards]. They stared wide-eyed at the panting Couriers. One pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's in the city, that way—are you the Moonlight Rider?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You see anyone else with a better horse?&lt;/em&gt; We're nearly there, lads! And Ci! Let's go!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The three Couriers raced through the gates. Hawk was at the end of his rope. He'd been running for—he didn't know how many hours. And he was full of nerves. Nearly there, nearly—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The streets were full of people. Weisel's inhabitants. They turned to stare as Tritel rode Ci down the road, ignoring traffic laws. The other two Couriers were hot on Ci's hooves. Hawk stared at the crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Couriers on delivery! Clear the damn roads!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk screamed at max volume. People turned, stared, and obeyed. The three Couriers raced down the street shouting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Dealia! Where is she?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tritel looked around. Some people pointed. Salamani leapt &lt;em&gt;up &lt;/em&gt;onto a roof and turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Tritel, Hawk! Over there!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two Couriers turned. They raced down a street, pelted right. Towards the frozen convoy of minor nobles. Lady Dealia and her house stared as the Couriers ran at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] of House Zolde stared as the three Couriers bore down on her. Her two brothers and their bodyguards reacted, reaching for their weapons. But Tritel rode down on all of them, full of lather and adrenaline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Are you Lady Dealia Zolde?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am. Are you—the Couriers?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Dealia's eyes were wide, darkened with shadow. She was indeed one of the most beautiful [Ladies] of Izril and her makeup accented her Chandrarian features. Her brothers looked at Hawk with wide eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The nobles had been sitting around a table with a scrying orb on it. Hawk glanced at the image. Tritel was dismounting as Ci panted. The horse walked over to a cup one of the Zolde [Lords] had been drinking from and stuck out her tongue. He stared as she lapped up the water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Delivery for you. From Lady Hetessana. If you have a seal, we'll take it. Otherwise—here. Direct delivery. Apologies for the delay. Some idiot got his legs broken. What?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] was staring at Tritel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You—you're on the scrying orb. You're still running—we've been watching your progress."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed weakly at the orb. Hawk saw that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was being shown on the orb, running. Some Drake—Noass—was commentating in the corner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;…Looks like they're nearly to their destination. I understand this will be very unfortunate for Lord Bein, but I don't think anyone will stop the Couriers at this point. This is of course, hah, all &lt;/em&gt;Human &lt;em&gt;politics. But er…not that we have anything against Humans. Salt of the earth. Good if they don't steal your cities, all that…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They must have delayed the spell."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani jogged up. He wiped at his forehead as the nobility stared. Lady Dealia saw the short man thrust the little locket at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your delivery, Lady. Will you take it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She hesitated. And the &lt;em&gt;dramatis personae &lt;/em&gt;of this event, the tired Couriers, the crowd who realized &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were going to be on the scrying orb and began waving at the sky—all of them had forgotten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At the heart of it all was a love story. One of those classic ones. Lady Dealia's eyes shone as she inspected the amulet. One of her brothers uttered a quiet oath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Sands take us. A Terland amulet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you need to have it tested?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other brother, the eldest, looked at his younger sister. Dealia shook her head silently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I—I know it's real. It's Bein's."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk saw her bow her head. And he realized the young [Lady] was truly heartbroken. Tritel stepped back. He elbowed Ci and the mare stopped lapping water from the cup. Everyone turned to Dealia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So it's true. Lord Bein was unfaithful."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The older of the Zolde brothers leaned on the table. Dealia nodded silently. Her younger brother, who might have been seventeen, stood up abruptly. He took the locket from Dealia and hurled it onto the ground. He stomped on it—but the amulet &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an artifact. With a curse, the [Lord] kicked it across the street, into the crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hey. We delivered that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk protested weakly. Salamani elbowed him and whispered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We're done. Watch the show."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Lord Qiam! Lady Dealia! Do you have anything to say about this delivery? We've been following the entire affair—I'm with Wistram! Excuse me, let me through!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A voice in the crowd. A [Mage] from the local guild was holding a scrying mirror over her head. Noass was shouting through the mirror, at the nobles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They stared as the Drake addressed them. And then they became part of the entertainment. They weren't used to it. Television, being broadcast. So—their reactions were genuine. The younger brother, Qiam, addressed the mirror stiffly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The engagement's off! And this filthy Terland rat—who thinks he can play games with my sister's heart? He owes us a blood debt and our family won't rest until it's met!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The crowd erupted into shouts, mainly in support of the heartbroken Dealia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You heard it here first, folks! The Zolde and Terland Houses are at war! Lord Bein's unfaithfulness has provoked a conflict between Izril's nobility!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Wait, we didn't say &lt;em&gt;war—&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Alarmed, the older [Lord] of House Zolde tried to speak. Dealia herself said nothing. The [Lady] was in tears. Noass kept shouting, mainly recounting the lurid details of the affair within earshot of Dealia herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk glanced at Salamani. The [Mage] poked Tritel. The [Rider] elbowed Ci. The mare snorted and nodded. They backed away as Noass and the crowd and the Zolde family became the center of another drama. Because that was &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Couriers had done their job. Suddenly, they were out of the public eye. Forgotten. But that was how it worked. Hawk examined his feet. He elbowed Salamani.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I'm never doing that again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Come on, Hawk. It's good exposure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't work for attention. I want gold."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Well, we've got that. Drinks are on me, lads. Let's find a good inn and sleep with our ears to the doors. We'll have to find a place where Ci can eat with us too."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Hawk rolled his eyes. But he walked off with the other Runners. And from their run, Lord Bein was outed as a treacherous philanderer, the Zolde family and the Terland House were at &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And the Runner's Guild pushed back on the Guild of Assassins. They may be threatened. But they did their deliveries, come rain or shine or poisoned blades in the night. You could stop a City Runner. But one of Izril's best? You were taking a risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Couriers.&lt;/em&gt; Selys Shivertail gazed into Rufelt's mirror. She shivered, as for a second, the image focused on Hawk and the other Couriers. She stared at Hawk. The silly, affable Rabbitman who wooed Drakes in Liscor with carrot-related foods. Who had smashed through a carriage of [Assassins] with his bare fists and feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She looked around. People were watching the broadcast. The Drake [Heiress] leaned over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know, I'm actually dating him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Gnoll [Bartender] gave Selys a blank look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Congratulations. I serve him drinks."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That night, Hawk was one of the talks of the city. The three Couriers…well, four counting Ci, were feasted. And no [Assassins] came to kill them. Or if they were poisoned, it was so subtly none of them could tell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Dealia's heartbroken grief was almost overshadowed by the drama of everything. The Couriers were stars, that shone for at least a little while. Hawk himself received a number of offers for companionship that night which he declined; he had a special someone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Salamani was another case. &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; certainly enjoyed the attention. But Tritel was, like Hawk, taken. Ci had to approve any female companionship. And she did not, by and large.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Lord Bein was in a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of trouble. And that was what this all about, wasn't it? A love story. The world had focused on the matter of [Assassins], the pride of Couriers, the private drama of a young [Lady]'s heartbreak with lurid fascination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Because it was the most important, topical thing in the world. More than the King of Destruction's ongoing war with Jecrass. More than any other major event, like possible conflict with the Kingdom of Ailendamus, the eternal struggle of the Blighted Kingdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;This was the most important thing. Because people were focused on it. Ergo, it was important. Right? Noass and his broadcast illuminated what mattered. That was how it worked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;At the same time as Ci was stealing food from Hawk's dinner plate, a completely &lt;em&gt;unimportant&lt;/em&gt; person was watching Noass through the scrying orb. Her head twisted right, left. As if trying to understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Curious."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr looked at Noass. Her immortal eyes narrowed on his face. Noass shivered for a second in the broadcast—after a ten minute delay. But he kept talking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;…wonders what will become of the drama. Obviously, this is a scandalous affair. Also in the news, we have a wedding between one of Calanfer's [Princesses] and a [Baron] of some other Terandrian Kingdom. I'll find the names in a moment. Hopefully the planned nuptials won't be disrupted by &lt;/em&gt;another&lt;em&gt; bout of infidelity. Males, cover your tails! Ha, ha…that was a joke…&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strange."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Stitch Witch looked at the scrying orb. Here was…importance. Weight. And yet—this Drake wasn't talking about the village that had been slaughtered. He was focused on a spat between lovers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not her…evil. The Stitch Witch stared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Strange. Is this what matters in this era?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Something in her spoke. &lt;em&gt;It has always been so.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Always. This is just another way, another version of the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She could slaughter a city. But would it matter? The Stitch Witch thought. And thought. And then—she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Couriers."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had seen them. Running about. High-level for who they were. But they had been on the scrying orb. They were thus…important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Witch]'s logic was very simple. If this was what the world cared about, then doing something to them would attract attention. There would be consequences. But she had accepted them. For her daughter, she would dare death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So she stood. That unimportant, unremarked upon person. Who had never featured in one of Noass' broadcasts, or Sir Relz's snappy commentaries. They might not even know she existed. Might not even know her name. That unimportant [Stitch Witch]. Whose level was higher than any two of the Courier's put together. Who had existed for time immemorial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They told stories of her in Chandrar. They refused to speak her name in Terandria. She had laid low armies, made terrible pacts. She crept in and out of myth and legend. The [Witch] the hero went to. The dark thread that laid low dynasties by their hubris and greed, through dark magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was not Az'kerash, who dominated the world's stage. She was the Spider, whose talent was laying webs. Surviving. But such an old spider. And the world was so small these days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Stitch Witch smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"So. &lt;em&gt;Small.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She began to walk. Or ride her dark horse, stitched together of midnight. Was it both? Neither?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A shadow crossed Izril. A traveller on the road turned his head, and saw an old woman walking past him. He nearly called out. But fear chilled his tongue as he saw the tall shape.&lt;em&gt; The moving shadows.&lt;/em&gt; He looked into her ringed gaze. And he beheld his mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment. Then he blinked and she was gone. But the memory stayed with him. On dark nights. He remembered that gaze and knew with certainty he would one day die. And his bones and flesh would rot in the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A silence descended in a forest. The creatures of the night stopped making sound. Stopped moving. A rabbit's heart burst as it hid in its den. Because it had seen a passing thing that scared it out of its mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A [Witch] walked and brought the old world with her. Old evil, which remembered lost glories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evil, crawling across Izril.&lt;/em&gt; But—Belavierr herself didn't realize it. Something funny was happening. Her steps…curved. And her voyage through the darkness was twisted. She did not notice it at first, so confident was she. But it was happening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Somehow, she was going the wrong way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The evening was almost given way to pure darkness. The clouds were out. A fitting day for it. Lady Ieka Imarris stared pensively out of the coach's windows as she rode. The [Mage Lady] rode in her personal spell-coach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Again, not the famous pink carriage of Magnolia Reinhart. But she wasn't the only one with magic. This wasn't as fast as the legendary carriage, but so what? It was comfortable, shielded. Protected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Ieka's bodyguard rode with the coach. Armored bodyguards, wearing spelled plate armor that she had enchanted herself. Ieka would have trusted them to go up against a group of [Knights]. And if it came to it, she herself would cast magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was a [Mage Lady], one of the [Ladies] you would have to list if you named Izril's most influential. Not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best in say, beauty. Lady Wuvren would have to take that spot, for all she was over &lt;em&gt;sixty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not the most famously passionate either. Lady Bethal or Lady Pryde came to mind, even though Ieka was known for her temper as well. But those two…grandstanding [Ladies] were somehow more &lt;em&gt;iconic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And Ieka was not considered the most powerful, despite her talent for magic, amplified by her noble class. Point to Lady &lt;em&gt;Magnolia Reinhart &lt;/em&gt;herself for that. Or the aged Zanthia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka ground her teeth together. She was not the first 'anything'. And that made her bitter. Not that it mattered. It was just the will of the masses. Social gossip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But it also did matter. She bore Magnolia Reinhart a grudge. So deeply that Ieka was opposed to her. In public, and private.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was part of a group known as the Circle of Thorns. In daylight, she was also an ally of Tyrion Veltras—the Imarris family was a traditional ally of the Veltras family, but Ieka was even more so. She was influential and had connections beyond those simply afforded to her by her station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had graduated from Wistram. She knew their world as well. She could, at her whim, use her &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. And Ieka was generous with her allies. She valued magic, resourcefulness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And she disliked Magnolia Reinhart. Not just because the other woman was famous; that was just a quibble. Magnolia Reinhart, to Ieka, was shallow, manipulative, controlling. Izril did not need her. Most importantly, though, Ieka truly wanted a better future for Izril. She had fought the Goblin King. She had lost her sister at the Sacrifice of Roses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Everyone had lost something. That day lingered in the mind of Izril's nobility. A terrible day and night. When they had marched against the Goblin King. A decade past and still. Ieka could close her eyes and remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They marched out of the city dressed like a field of flowers. Bright clothing, while the men wore armor and clashed with the Goblins. Outnumbered. Outnumbered by Goblins and outmatched.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goblin King himself took to the field after the long siege. His Goblin Lords assailed the defenders of First Landing mercilessly. Slaughtering. Even the champions of Izril were too few.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;So the nobility walked, dressed for a ball. Because armor would have stifled their abilities. [Ladies], on procession. Shielded by nothing but their Skills and flimsy lines of [Soldiers]. Turning the tide. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They threw the Goblins back. Again, and again. The Goblin King himself fought their wills. They had power, the [Ladies] in their fine dresses. But he had another sort. So he rode into their lines and cut down the flowers by the dozens. Until he was finally hurled away. They halted the Goblin King's advance that day. But the ground ran with the blood of the flowers of Izril.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She could remember it if she closed her eyes. Lady Ieka felt her eyes stinging. Tears, unshed. Everyone had lost something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Perhaps none more so than the woman who sat across from her. Lady Rie Valerund, last of her name. More than one noble house had died that day. And those that remained…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The bidding war is over, Ieka."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What war?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a moment, the [Mage Lady] did not know what was being said. She was still there. Drenched in gore, holding her wand, looking around for her sister as the [Soldiers] pushed back the Goblins. Hearing the screams of the dying nobility and the Goblins' war drums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then she was back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The bidding for the Potion of Youth? Who won, then?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Rie Valerund was consulting a scroll that Ieka used to follow the bidding of valuable items. She hadn't bothered even making a bid for the Potion of Youth. For one thing, she hadn't needed it. Her star had yet to fade. But the item's purchaser was another matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Guess."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Rie's face told Ieka everything. The other [Lady] paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What does Reinhart need with &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; potion?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Leverage, no doubt. Any number of [Lords] might jump for it. Lord Pellmia, for instance. Ieka—are you certain this is wise?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Mage Lady] returned to looking out the window. She had been in the carriage all day. It was a difficult business, travelling fast in Izril. Couriers, even Couriers took days to travel the continent. Damn Magnolia's carriage, with all its ancient magical enchantments. It was yet another thing the Lady Reinhart had over her enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka had also made a stop to pick Lady Rie up. She was living in Riverfarm of all places. In a terribly tiny house. But Ieka understood the sacrifice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Some things are more important than…differences, Rie. You know it. As do I. The Circle opposes Reinhart in so much. But this?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Rie bit her lip. If Ieka hated Magnolia, Lady Rie Valerund blamed Magnolia Reinhart for so much more. And yet…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I understand. I communicated the necessity. But we are risking our lives."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And? This is the very thing the Circle was made of. The old ways. Not Magnolia's new ideas. Peace with the Drakes? But she is right in this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Ieka's eyes flashed. She did not like this any more than Rie. And she was more powerful than Rie, in every sense. The other [Lady] sat back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Silence. The carriage rolled on. Until it stopped. Then—one of the armored bodyguards, [Spellarmor Warriors]—a weaker class than Ieka wanted, she would have preferred [Mage Knights]—rapped on the glass window.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Imarris. We have arrived."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The voice behind the helmet was female. And all of the [Riders] were. Men would have not been appropriate tonight. Ieka rose, her legs sore from inactivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is time. Keep your forces back, Celaene. Unless we signal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Yes, Lady Imarris."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The leader of Ieka's bodyguard was restless. Rightly so. But the two [Ladies] were  controlled. That was what being a [Lady] was. Grace, even in the face of death. To Ieka, that was what it was. Other people had different ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Rie?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Lady] exited the coach. And Lady Ieka found herself standing in a field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A wheat field, perhaps. Recently cleared for harvest. It did not &lt;em&gt;jive&lt;/em&gt; with her shoes at all. Ieka frowned; Rie had a much more sensible shoe on. But both [Ladies] wore dresses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They made their way towards a group not far distant as the [Bodyguards] retreated. And there, standing in the splintered rays of moonlight and under cloud was a gathering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Ladies] turned their heads as Rie and Ieka approached. Just…around three dozen [Ladies]. More than Ieka expected. All of them she knew on sight. And the ones in the center made Ieka's jaw tighten. But she turned her head, looking about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Ladies] had brought their own escorts. Bodyguards, small groups like Ieka's elites. The [Mage Lady] saw groups of female [Guards]. Higher-level individuals. Personal aides—a group of [Maids] standing by one pink carriage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And to the side—[Knights]. Dressed in flamboyant pink armor. The Knights of the Petal. Ieka scowled at them. And she stared at the [Lady] who had always claimed her elites were better than Ieka's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Bethal Walchaís stood in the center of the circle of [Ladies] in their dresses, in the field. Well—she was not wearing a dress. Contrarian as always, she had on riding clothes. But for once, her husband was nowhere to be seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was not the only one. There, standing next to her was arrogance personified. Pride, embodied in Pryde. Never more suitable a name existed. The [Lady]'s eyes flashed imperiously as she turned her head, but she would never have acknowledged Ieka first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Next to her, a woman in her twenties, in full youthful bloom. Or—she might be a woman in her thirties, next. Older, younger—Lady Wuvren, the most beautiful [Lady] in all of Izril had an appearance which always belied her age. And she too was not surrounded by her suitors. Her male suitors, at any rate. Ieka nearly sneered at Wuvren's clothing. But then she saw a face that did give her pause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Zanthia was the only one there for whom Ieka had any respect. And the old woman was unchanged. Dignified, standing in the loose soil and fallen stems of wheat like she stood in the most noble of receptions. She nodded slowly towards Ieka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And in the center of them all was &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; A shorter woman than Ieka, by a bit. A bit plumper too. But then—her sweet tooth was legendary. And her smile and expression was welcoming, open. But the most deadly of the flowers of Izril did not fool Ieka one whit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Ieka. I'm so glad you could make it. And Lady Rie as well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Magnolia. And I see the others have gathered as well. I was delayed in gathering Lady Rie."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka inclined her head slowly. Stiffly. The other [Ladies] smiled or nodded, but Bethal didn't give even that pretense. She just &lt;em&gt;stared&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;So did Rie. The Lady Valerund had turned into a statue upon seeing Magnolia. Ieka looked at her. Well, they did not have to stand together. But Ieka drifted forwards as Rie sketched the most rudimentary of curtsies and held back, among the outer circle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Ieka. I was most gratified to hear your response. And that you came. Despite our…differences."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That we'd stab each other to death on any other day.&lt;/em&gt; Ieka nodded at Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Special circumstances. Do you want to say something, Bethal?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Lady]'s gaze was burning a hole in the side of Ieka's head. The [Mage Lady] turned her gaze and acknowledged Bethal at last. The Lady Walchaís spoke slowly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I received a flower."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ah, the black flower.&lt;/em&gt; Ieka had sent it with others a while ago. But Bethal would not forget. The black flower of cowardice, a symbol sent to those who had not been at the Sacrifice of Roses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Bethal had. Ieka felt something of a pang of guilt. But the gesture had been calculated. And they &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; sabotaged Tyrion's conquest of Liscor. But for them and the south of Izril would have been opened. All that work, money spent, time, for nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"And, Bethal?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How dare you? We were &lt;em&gt;both &lt;/em&gt;there. I can understand the other cowards, but you? Have you forgotten your own sister?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal's voice was low, a hiss. And the air around her was jagged, like thorns. Ieka's head jerked, as if she'd been struck. And she might have been—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Their auras clashed in the night. The other [Ladies] didn't draw back, but guarded themselves. Bethal's was thorns, almost physical. They could cut and tear flesh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka's? Hers was magic. &lt;em&gt;Power.&lt;/em&gt; It made the air charged, and spellcraft more potent around her. Now, she clashed with Bethal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Forget? You forget &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt;, Bethal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ladies!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia's voice was a brisk snap. And she clapped her hands. Both Bethal and Ieka felt a third presence bearing down on them. Neither one stopped pushing—Magnolia was strong, but she couldn't overpower Ieka so easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A shift. Ieka's [Bodyguards] sensed the conflict. How not, when two [Ladies] were clashing this fiercely? They were all women too—that mattered. Bethal's female [Knights] moved, regarding their counterparts. And amid the carriages, one of the [Maids], the most powerful of the lot, practically a [Lady] among the common folk—moved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia stopped Ressa with a hand. It was Zanthia who spoke, and &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; aura cut the other auras down to size like a precise blade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bethal. We can quarrel later. But we do not fight &lt;em&gt;here.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady of Thorns] stopped. Her cheeks flamed with fury and righteous outrage, but her [Aura of Thorns] that gave her such fame, subsided. Ieka relaxed as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Thank you, Zanthia. [Ladies], all present. We have our differences. But those of you who have laid aside your grudges, I thank you. For our purpose is above squabbles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka herself nodded as Magnolia called out to the other [Ladies], some in their own circles. Even she agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We are fewer than I would like, Magnolia. And if we are not allowing our retainers to enter battle…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren's voice was charm incarnate. But Pryde spoke, harshly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If we were, you would have been better served bringing that Troll of yours, Wuvren."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Baron? Yes indeed. But I was informed to bring only female bodyguards if any. And Magnolia sent her carriage for me…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Eternal Beauty] sighed, smiling mischievously at Pryde. The other woman had her arms crossed. She was even more competitive than Ieka. She also had a grudge with most of the [Ladies] present. Bethal, for winning Thomast, Wuvren for her title as most beautiful…but Pryde was a girl still. Defined by one attribute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was to Zanthia that Ieka listened, and Magnolia herself, however grudgingly. And Zanthia spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Men are not welcome here. Not for this purpose."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They were when we pushed back the Goblin King."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They interfered. They were necessary, but this is not a combat, Bethal. Not in the same way. Our retainers will stay back, unless they are needed. And they are only needed if we have &lt;em&gt;lost.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia cautioned Bethal. The [Lady] considered this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"…I will speak to Truvia."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stomped away from the circle, brushing past two other [Ladies]. The inner circle stood, with Ieka as the outsider. But Ieka Imarris refused to leave. She was one of the most high-level [Ladies] here. And she counted. Including Bethal…Pryde, Wuvren, Zanthia, Magnolia, herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Six? Wouldn't seven be more appropriate to confront directly?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Six will do, Ieka. As I said, the plan does not require direct victory. We will follow the plan. And seven might play into her hands. Numbers matter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia smiled, but tensely. Ieka nodded.&lt;em&gt; True enough.&lt;/em&gt; Still…she cast her eyes over the three dozen or so [Ladies].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How long?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Soon. I invited her, and she is coming. Whether she wills it or not. Take your places, [Ladies]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The group changed. The retainers moved back, to the edges. The younger [Ladies]—and they were all of their majority here—stood behind the older, higher-level ones. And Magnolia and the circle of five…six as Bethal came hurrying back…were in front.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A semi-circle. Awaiting something. Zanthia stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Wuvren and Ieka. Magnolia was in the center. Fittingly enough, although that irked Ieka. She put it out of her mind. There was no room for dissension here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No scrying orb portrayed the [Ladies] gathered here. Noass had no idea it was happening. Few people did. So this event—with many of Izril's foremost [Ladies], each one some of the most powerful individuals on the continent—was not important. Not at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And neither was the dark shadow who walked out of the night. Slowly, quickly, taking singular steps but travelling far with each one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr paused as she came to the open field. She looked around. This was not where she had intended to go. But her footsteps carried her forwards. Towards the waiting [Ladies] in their dresses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. I was summoned."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was all she said to herself. She studied the [Ladies] in the center, noting each one. Dismissing them. The noblewomen stared back. Bethal through narrowed eyes, breathing heavily. Pryde appraising and dismissing the [Witch]. Wuvren frowning, troubled. Ieka watchful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zanthia gave Belavierr a singular nod. From one enemy to another. And Magnolia smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, there is our guest of the hour. A spider crawling through my domain. Through Izril. Welcome, Belavierr. Or do you prefer another name? Also—and I hate to be a bother. But would you kindly end yourself? That would save us all some trouble."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] extended a hand. Those gathered here, all female, stirred. And a word ran through them unspoken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witch.&lt;/em&gt; Old power, older even than theirs. Belavierr tilted her head. She regarded Magnolia Reinhart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You called me here. Summoned me to this place. Someone here remembers the old ways. But has forgotten caution."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stepped forwards. First a shadow, distant. Then—Ieka felt her heart jolt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Stitch Witch stared down at her. She was &lt;em&gt;tall.&lt;/em&gt; Her hat impossibly wide. Her eyes orange, glowing, ringed. Her clothes were not black. Black was &lt;em&gt;passé&lt;/em&gt;, clichéd. Her clothes were dark blue. So dark you might have assumed they were black. But dark as the abyss in the sea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why have you brought me here, children of Izril?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Stitch Witch's voice made the [Ladies] stir. There was not one ounce of acknowledgement of their station. Or even comprehension of their nobility. It was flat. Not disinterested. But…perhaps superior was the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal's eyes narrowed. But Magnolia spoke, cheerfully. She was in charge of the…negotiations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I couldn't help but notice the slaughtered villages in my lands. The flesh giant you sent towards my city was most unwelcome, Miss Belavierr. And you have not stopped. You do not seem to realize there is law. Surely you did not think you could do as you pleased without repercussions?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Witch] glanced at Magnolia. Then she stared at Zanthia's face. Wuvren's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I know you two. Do I not? Of old."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not as allies. Hello. Belavierr, was it? I never got your name the first time. I'm quite displeased to meet you again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren smiled, but with effort. Zanthia just met Belavierr's eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I warned you the last time we met. Izril has no place for your kind."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;But I have been here longer than you.&lt;/em&gt; I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr's voice was low. And something—changed in her. An awareness. Immortal distance vanishing. Something else stared at Zanthia. And the old [Lady] closed her eyes. As something peeked out of Belavierr's face. The Stitch Witch looked at the two and Wuvren shuddered. She nearly took a step back, but Pryde and Bethal steadied her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You both refused. But here you stand. And I have no offers to make. Just darkness. Evil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Her body twisted. Hunched. Her hands reached out, towards Wuvren. The [Lady] recoiled and Ieka felt herself being sucked into those rings. That &lt;em&gt;smile—&lt;/em&gt;she fought, but the [Witch] was laughing &lt;em&gt;in her head&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia snapped her fingers under Belavierr's nose. The Stitch Witch recoiled slightly. Ieka felt her presence lessen. And she felt it in the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Something like a &lt;em&gt;slap&lt;/em&gt;, only done without sight or sound. But a slap nevertheless. One comprised purely of presence. Aura. The Stitch Witch backed up as Magnolia smiled at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I was told you were quite rude. I didn't imagine how much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Hm."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr's head twisted from side to side. Ieka saw Wuvren draw closer and the other [Ladies] watched, appraising. It hadn't even moved the Stitch Witch. In Ieka's head, she wondered if someone else would have actually been sent flying. She shuddered. Suddenly, all her reservations about aiding Magnolia were gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do you want? &lt;em&gt;Woman.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr looked at Magnolia. A tall spectre. The [Lady] stood there, in her pink dress, and smiled coldly. Her eyes flashed as the other five [Ladies] held their ground next to her. Giving her their authority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are not welcome in Izril, Belavierr the Stitch Witch. You will not haunt my lands any longer. I demand you gone, as Lady Magnolia Reinhart. &lt;em&gt;These are my lands, Witch. Not yours.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The words cracked the air. Ieka felt a &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; and joined in. Belavierr rocked backwards. Her heels dug into the ground, as if resisting something. All the [Ladies] &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt;, but the Stitch Witch held her ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On Magnolia's territory no less. Ieka felt sweat beading down her back. That was…the Stitch Witch eyed Magnolia. And she seemed to wake up even more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Banishment. You cannot exile me, girl. You are too &lt;em&gt;small.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I eat too much sugar, according to my maid. And I have every intention of tossing you out like the trash you are. Do you wish to make this difficult? Because I could spank &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; like a girl if it helps change your mind."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia's smile was flinty. She taunted the [Witch]. And Belavierr's eyes narrowed. She did not &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the insults, silly as they were. Ieka felt the presence deepen around her. She looked down and wished she hadn't. Her shadows were &lt;em&gt;crawling&lt;/em&gt;. As if something was moving in them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The moonlight vanished from the sky. Belavierr seemed to grow taller. Her voice…changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have met [Ladies] before. Those who grasped immortality. Those who stood against monarchs. You are neither. You overestimate your power."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She flicked her hand. And a needle flashed across the distance. It shot at Magnolia's face. And &lt;em&gt;snapped&lt;/em&gt; in midair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia lowered her hand. She'd crooked a finger. Belavierr stared at the broken needle. Then she shrugged. She reached out towards Magnolia's face. Her hand made it halfway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Then it twisted. Gravity &lt;em&gt;snapped&lt;/em&gt; it down. Invisible thorns pierced it. Something &lt;em&gt;cracked&lt;/em&gt; it backwards. The [Witch]'s hand moved back. For a second Ieka thought she saw broken skin, twisted bone and—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was the same hand, unharmed. Belavierr regarded it. She looked past Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal, Pryde, and Ieka stared at her. The [Lady of Thorns] was vibrating. She opened her mouth, eyes flashing, but Pryde beat her to it. Lady Pryde Ulta sniffed, and shook her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"How ancient, Temptress. And yet, you're quite weak for someone so old. I am disappointed. All this time and effort for what?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She tossed her head. Belavierr looked at her. Pryde met her gaze with a small smile on her lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. Pride. And passion. Beauty? Magic. And you?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr looked from face to face. Pryde, Bethal, Wuvren, Ieka, and then Zanthia. The old woman narrowed her eyes and folded her arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am not a word, Spider. Begone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Nor I. &lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka murmured. She held a wand in her hand, though this was not a duel like in Wistram. Magic hummed in her very veins. Wuvren nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We refuse you, Belavierr."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Walk away now, [Witch]. We threw back the Goblin King and his armies at First Landing. We will do so again."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal's voice hummed in the air. Belavierr looked at her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are unguarded, child. You should have brought armies. Champions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The shadows moved behind her. Needles of every shape and size flew out of her robes. The [Ladies] flicked their hands. The needles bounced off Ieka's barrier, &lt;em&gt;snapped&lt;/em&gt; in the air. Pryde's Skill, [Pride is Weight], broke the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But more than that—the magical needles were ineffective. Weaker. Belavierr paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah. This is formality."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She glanced around, as if staring at something. Magnolia smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are giving offense, Belavierr. But your presence is already one. I say again: begone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Both sides stared at each other. Belavierr was breaking a rule. Neither side struck at each other. They were…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Ladies]. And this was their place. This was their power. The same force that had thrown back the Goblin King.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not just First Landing's armies. They had thrown him back, forced him to order the retreat. But they had been fighting too. And because of that—because of his &lt;/em&gt;strength&lt;em&gt;, he had walked among them, cutting them down with his blades.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr was the same. Ieka was trying to &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt;, but it was like moving…her eyes flickered to the High Passes in the distance. Like the Goblin Lord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"But weaker."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal was biting her lip hard enough to draw blood. It was Belavierr who laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Weaker? &lt;em&gt;You do not even know what I am. &lt;/em&gt;And you are too few."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She laughed at the other [Ladies] behind the six. Three dozen. A fraction of a fraction of those who had died at the Sacrifice of Roses, let alone all who had stood there. Belavierr turned her head, counting. She looked at Lady Rie for a moment and smiled. The [Lady] was frozen, her face a mask of defiance and concentration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was to Magnolia that Belavierr looked at again. The [Lady] was smiling slightly. But an invisible blade was trying to drive itself through Belavierr's head. Still, the Stitch Witch resisted. The shadows were roiling. And then she began to whisper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Your thread is mixed. Part woven by ancient fire. Yet you stand here.&lt;/em&gt; There is no one to protect you. And I remember when your family first stepped onto this land. You are unguarded, girl."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The words made Ieka start. They meant something. Magnolia's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I do not need outsiders to oust you, Belavierr. For armies, I trust to [Generals]. For other threats, I hire or find those to do the job. But for a spider in my house? We need no other."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;No man. No outsiders. The [Ladies] &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt;. And Belavierr laughed. She was gathering her strength. Ieka felt sweat sliding down her back, now, and beading on her forehead. &lt;em&gt;Composure.&lt;/em&gt; She could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lose it. She could not be the weakest one! She refused!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;It will be your death. &lt;/em&gt;I make no bargains tonight. I have only one will in my heart. And that is—evil."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;What a ridiculous word, coming from her. The very incarnation of it. But she said it like it was a mystery. A children's word. Magnolia spoke, enunciating each word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We are the [Ladies] of Izril. And we need no other save for ourselves to deal with threats like you. The day we do, this land is lost to our people. And if it is evil you seek—end us now, Belavierr. And doom the north."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;It was an invitation. A challenge. The six [Ladies] and those behind them stood, locked in a silent battle of wills. And the Stitch Witch waited. She counted their numbers. And then—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Under the obscured moon and stars, they fought. And the darkness moved. First, only the air rippled. Then, high above, the clouds began to swirl. Echoing the forces clashing below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On one side, the [Ladies]. They held their ground at first, and then began to move. Not in retreat, but graceful steps. As if they danced among the empty field. Their dresses rustled, and they shone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Like fireflies in the night. Flaring, fading. Flowers in bloom before they wilted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And on the other side was the Stitch Witch. She smiled, a Spider who had woven her immortality out of threads made of life and time. She too moved slowly. Bound by the rules of the engagement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The night began to change. Shadows grew and rose. Along the edges of the field, figures began to stir. Trying to break the dance. They were unwelcome, and they suffered the breaking of the rules. But still they moved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What level is she? She is ancient of years."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren's voice trembled with the strain as the [Ladies] circled the [Witch]. She was reaching for them, slowly, and they were stepping out of the way. &lt;em&gt;Dancing.&lt;/em&gt; And invisible, in the sky, the forces collided.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Old. She is breaking the rules of hospitality and still she remains. Hold her. Our escorts will keep the circle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia's voice was calm. She watched, as along the edge of the fields, a pink carriage began to move. [Maids] walked at the shadows which revealed figures, sewn into shapes that ridiculed reality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"They cannot do so alone. Leave the interlopers to him."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A whisper. It came from Zanthia. And out of the darkness stepped a man with a blade. Ieka &lt;em&gt;hissed&lt;/em&gt;. But it was not Bethal's husband. If it had been, they would have been damned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Yet it was a he. A glowing figure, stepping out of forever. As Lady Zanthia danced, gracefully amid the moonlight, he appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[The Eternal Partner]. He bowed and she nodded to him. Smoothly, the Stitch-Man stepped into the shadows. And they parted at the touch of his sword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You cannot kill me with memory alone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A whisper. The [Ladies] turned their heads. The Stitch Witch stood at the center of the dance. And she refused to move. She laughed at Zanthia, mockingly. Her voice was a scratching in the head, a worming whisper, trying to undermine their wills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You &lt;em&gt;fade. &lt;/em&gt;You will die and be forgotten."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That may be so. But I crave nothing you offer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zanthia replied. Her will was beyond steel. She looked at Belavierr, unafraid of anything the Stitch Witch held. She flicked her hand and Belavierr staggered. The [Witch] narrowed her eyes, seeking another target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Beauty is fleeting. You disguise your age. Time will unravel you.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;An older woman flinched. For a moment, Ieka saw a lined face, white hair. Flaw. And then Wuvren smiled, gracefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am very vain, it is true. But do not mistake my vanity for weakness. I have refused you once. And you are quite rude. Begone, please?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She pointed. Belavierr's foot moved. She looked past Wuvren, frustrated. Her eyes alighted on Bethal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Passion burns out.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Your love will abandon you.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal's head jerked. She faltered in her steps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Not so long as my heart remains true. And it is I who choose to love. Go away, Witch. I have faced true monsters."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Goblin King is only one threat. The others will snuff your second heart out. You cannot protect him or yourself.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal's footsteps changed. She began walking towards Belavierr. Fury burned in her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Bethal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka tried to warn Bethal. She raised her wand, straining. Pointing it at Belavierr—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt; No magic. She instead conjured a wall of glass. It rose to Bethal's midriff, blocking her. The [Lady] looked at Ieka. But then she moved back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Your magic is so weak, little [Mage]. I could give you true power. It is all locked away. You know how weak you are.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr was in her head. Ieka closed her eyes, trying to resist it. The worst part was that she knew it was true. She tried—but the whispers were in her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You will never know the magic of old. But I have lived it.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I refuse your—I will not—"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She was drawing closer to Belavierr. Ieka saw the other [Ladies] looking at her. &lt;em&gt;No!&lt;/em&gt; She tried to resist, tell herself it was a flawed offer. But the allure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Power. Ieka looked at Belavierr. And she knew. She wanted to take the Stitch Witch's offer. Even for the cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;True magic.&lt;/em&gt; Ieka was drawn towards those eyes. Into that smile. She saw Magnolia raising a hand, calling out—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And then—a woman stood in front of Belavierr. Standing tall. Her hair was black. Her eyes orange, like Belavierr's. But burning orange, not the unearthly glow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pryde.&lt;/em&gt; And she looked up at Belavierr as the Stitch Witch stared down. Pryde's eyes were contemptuous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have had enough of your whispers, creature. &lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She raised a hand. And &lt;em&gt;slapped&lt;/em&gt; Belavierr across the face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Pryde!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka stumbled. Belavierr's influence on her faded and she stepped back. But Pryde—had broken one of the rules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stood there, the picture of arrogance. Pride made flesh. Belavierr stumbled. The blow had knocked her backwards. The [Ladies] paused uncertainly. And the Stitch Witch laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Mockingly. She stood over Pryde. And the Lady Ulta's vainglorious ego faltered for a second as Belavierr spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pride is fleeting. &lt;em&gt;It dies.&lt;/em&gt; And you? You do not even know how &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; you are."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of her hands swung downwards. A blow. Pryde braced herself, using her greatest Skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Pride is Unbreak—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The blow drove her down. Into the earth. She lay there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Pryde."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"She's alive. The idiot. Wuvren."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zanthia swept forwards. They lifted the [Lady]. Pryde's head  was lolling. Her ego—extinguished. And the six were five.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;That was enough. Belavierr smiled. And she seemed to grow taller still. Until she was far, far too large for her mortal frame. A dark giant staring down at them. The [Ladies] backed up and the darkness closed in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia was the last. She stared up as Belavierr leaned down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You walk with those who would live forever. But you cannot follow our paths. Take my hand. And you will know no fear from time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman stared at the hand reaching towards her. And her hand twitched. But then she sighed. A bit ruefully, and smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Belavierr. You are indeed powerful. But you are a constant. You do not change because you know nothing. You lose nothing and gain nothing. I would prefer to &lt;em&gt;live,&lt;/em&gt; rather than to never die. However brief I may have, it is my time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She stepped back. The Stitch Witch's eyes narrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Then die."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She raised a hand, as tall as the heavens. Ieka looked up. And Magnolia nodded. She glanced past Ieka and nodded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now.&lt;/em&gt; The [Ladies] turned and beckoned. Ieka called out and felt that she was heard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The jaws of the trap swung shut. Magnolia spoke as Belavierr's head turned. Too late, the Stitch Witch sensed…something. She looked down as Magnolia waved at her politely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Belavierr. You are many things. But first and foremost. You are &lt;em&gt;arrogant. &lt;/em&gt;We are small compared to you. But that is our strength. We do not stand alone."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The shadows moved. The clouds opened and moonlight shone down. The Stitch Witch turned her head. And out of the darkness rolled…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A carriage. First one, and then two. And then dozens. Led by horses, stopping, opening. But no [Assassins] burst from them. Instead, came figures in dresses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Tall and short. Young and old. Rich and…richer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;[Ladies]. Ieka turned and saw a young girl, walking with her peers. Lady Eliasor of House Melissar. Last of her line, like Rie. The girl stared at Belavierr, and then Lady Zanthia. The regal old [Lady] nodded, smiling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One of many. The coaches let out more and more [Ladies]. Over a hundred, and then two hundred. Minor houses. And major.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The last coach to stop and the last passenger was the oldest. A wheelchair moved across the bumpy ground. And the [Lady] was exhausted from her trip. Dying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But her eyes blazed. As Desinee pushed her, the matriarch of the House of El, Lady Maviola El, looked up at Belavierr. And only now did the Spider realize she had been tricked. She had walked into someone else's web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Why do you come here? There is only death here for you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A woman, a [Witch], but no giant, stood in the center of the gathering of [Ladies] as they spread out around her. Encircling her. Staring at the [Witch]. She raised her hand, threw needles. They broke in midair from a dozen different angles. She looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Maviola smiled. She saw Magnolia nod to her. And she inclined her head in return. She spoke, in a voice as soft as a whisper, but carried across the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The Five Families stand united when we must. For Goblin Kings. For war. And threats of your ilk. You are not welcome here, Spider."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;And now Belavierr knew. Her eyes narrowed and she cast about. Searching for a crack, a weakness to use. She spoke, as some of the youngest girls stared at her in horror. At the oldest of the [Ladies]. At them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is Izril's might? It is a wilted radiance. &lt;em&gt;Dying. &lt;/em&gt;All things fade. You are fragments and wisps of the [Lords] and [Ladies] who claimed this land. They walked with Giants and slew Dragons. What are you to them? &lt;em&gt;Children of a faded dream.&lt;/em&gt; You will wither and your families turn to dust. But I could give you power."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached out. [Ladies] drew back. And none took her hand. They looked at her. Afraid, wrathful, fearful—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But contemptuously. Refusing her. The Stitch Witch's face was changing. Her contempt for them was bared. A twisted expression of distaste, mirrored across both classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Zanthia spoke, her voice ringing across the field, reaching all of the women gathered there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Ladies of Izril. &lt;/em&gt;Behold the Temptress. She will come to you as you age. Each and every one of you. And she will offer you immortality, beauty. But what she asks is your very soul. We remember those who have fallen into her web. So we call her. So all races name her, the wretched creature creeping around legends and time. Temptress."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Spider."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal stared at Belavierr, her eyes blazing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Threadstealer."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren murmured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Stitch Witch."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka whispered. And Magnolia Reinhart smiled. With all the gestures of welcome and none of the feeling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Belavierr, we are young to you. But the flowers of Izril still bloom. And we stand united. It is you who forget; you have trespassed and given offense on our lands. &lt;em&gt;You are not welcome here. Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Ladies] echoed her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The whisper picked up. Eliasor spoke the word. Ieka said it. Rie whispered, staring in hate at Belavierr's face. The Stitch Witch's form…trembled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;From her resting place, Lady Pryde coughed. She stared at the [Witch] and mustered some defiance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have seen more impressive sights. &lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You have nothing we wish for. &lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Zanthia's voice was steady. Maviola El gazed at Belavierr.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are withered in turn, Belavierr. &lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The Stitch Witch threw her head back and &lt;em&gt;shrieked&lt;/em&gt; in fury. The sound made some of the [Ladies] start. But it did nothing. Bethal raised her head and pointed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You are not the Goblin King. &lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia Reinhart's eyes bored into Belavierr's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Begone from my lands.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She raised her hand, and the Ladies of Izril pointed as one. They spoke a word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: Vivaldi"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Begone.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Belavierr trembled. And then the air broke. The clouds split. The word rang and the Stitch Witch howled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The shadows &lt;em&gt;fled.&lt;/em&gt; Belavierr's own shadow flickered, banished, fleeing southwards. Thrown by the word. But the Stitch Witch remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;For a second, she lingered there. Refusing to leave, clutching at the ground. Her eyes blazed and her face twisted. But then—she couldn't hold on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Slowly, unwillingly, the [Witch] straightened. And she turned. Without a word, she began to walk. Away. Not just out of Invrisil's lands, but further still. Helpless. Her hatred raged against them. But it was done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Ieka collapsed onto the ground for a second, breathless, covered in sweat. She felt the dirt that had crept under her dress, her tired legs—all of it suddenly. The other [Ladies] rocked back, feeling the backlash as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Did we—did we do it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal was panting. Lady Zanthia nodded, tiredly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"It is done. She will not haunt Izril's north for months. Perhaps longer. We threw the Goblin King and his armies back from First Landing, but she is just one monster."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"One? But as terrible as he was."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Wuvren murmured. The others nodded silently. Even so, it was done. Wherever a [Lady] or [Lord] of Izril claimed land, Belavierr was unwelcome. There were more powerful deterrents. But few as complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She had been vanquished. But not slain. The irony of that was clear to Ieka as she glanced around. The [Ladies] of Izril had thrown her back—with less effort once they had gathered in their true numbers. But only that. So many women, who had come so far at Magnolia Reinhart's request.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But then—this &lt;em&gt;mattered&lt;/em&gt;. Threats like Belavierr were what the [Ladies] of Izril gathered for. And…the most notable guest slowly approached Magnolia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Lady Maviola El did not look too tired from the act of banishing Belavierr. But perhaps that was because she had little left to give. Her breathing was slow as she raised her head. Magnolia came towards her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Lady Maviola, you do me a great honor. But for you bringing so many, we might not have triumphed as easily."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman nodded. Just that. She did not look at Magnolia with fondness—but not with open distaste, either. Just…tiredness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"We do not stand in agreement often, Magnolia Reinhart. For this the House of El walks with you."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia took it as simply that. She curtsied slightly. And the old woman inclined her head. She was grand, Maviola El. Ieka had heard stories of &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; youth, which had promised to outstrip even Bethal and Pryde's exploits. But she also recalled Belavierr's words and looked at Maviola with sadness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You did not need to come yourself. Although I appreciate the gesture."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia looked at the old woman with concern. And she heard a laugh in reply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I wanted to see the Spider in person myself. A second time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka started. She looked at Zanthia and Wuvren. The two older [Ladies] nodded, their eyes glinting. And their words ceased to become hyperbole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She will come to every one of you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In time. &lt;/em&gt;Ieka shuddered, remembering the temptation of Belavierr's offer. How many had taken her bargains?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;But Maviola—it was she upon whom all the [Ladies] looked. Because they sensed it. So too had Maviola, at the beginning of it. The end of it. She spoke, raising her hand weakly to her chest as she looked at Magnolia, around at the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will not live to repel another such monster. I have made arrangements. The House of El will endure. But I…will not."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] behind Maviola, Desinee El, stared at her grandmother. And her eyes filled with tears. Magnolia's face was grave. Maviola looked at her, urgently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Do you have what I asked for?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Of course. I would not betray our bargain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Hah! &lt;/em&gt;An honest Reinhart. Will the world survive such a thing?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The woman's laugh was mocking. But her eyes fixed with longing on the vial Magnolia withdrew. It had been sent by Courier. Won in an auction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Ieka saw viridian light. A small vial. And she gasped, knowing what it was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Bethal started. She realized too. Pryde, wincing, but rapidly regaining her massive ego, stood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What is that, Bethal?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The…Potion of Youth. I bid on that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Ladies] looked at her. Exasperated, forgetting the moment, Ieka snapped at the woman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need it for, Bethal?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady of Thorns] met Ieka's gaze challengingly, and smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ten years, Pryde. It would have been a fine time, with Thomast and I younger than when we first met. I've always regretted not knowing him in his youth. Besides, it would last for &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; with us."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The other [Ladies] sighed. &lt;em&gt;Bethal Walchaís&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola for her part ignored the chatter in the background. She took the potion as Magnolia carefully offered it to her. And she smiled. Magnolia carefully spoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"You know it cannot reverse anything. It is temporary. If you wanted a potion to reverse your age, I could find something…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola cut her off with a shake of her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"The El family lacks the coin to pursue a mad dream of immortality, Lady Magnolia. Nor am I worth the cost, even if we could pay it. I am not like your old ghost of an ancestor. I know when I must exit the floor, and I intend to do it on my terms."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She eyed Magnolia, and almost all the [Ladies] knew exactly what she meant. Magnolia nodded after a beat. Her lips quirked slightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I will tell Regis that. It is like him to cling to life. And his wife gracefully left the stage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Even so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The two women exchanged a look of understanding, at least in this. Maviola regarded the potion. And for a moment there was genuine regret in her eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Ah, but the potions that Drake makes do work. And yet it is just youth. If he could make Potions of Reverse Aging…perhaps. But how many years would it reverse? Three years? Four? Even if he could make one that took ten years away, he is just one. This world has lost the ability to make powerful artifacts. And we lost our Mirror of Eternal Vitality. One wonders if Regis Reinhart keeps it. Do you know yourself, Magnolia?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"If he does, he won't share it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia remarked drily. Maviola laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Your curse is a troublesome one! Ah, but we all have our curses. Belavierr is Terandria's. So many nightmares come from that land. And the 'perfect' kingdoms we left. But enough. I say: enough. I am done. I do not wish the Stitch Witch's cursed life forever. It is time. Desinee. Bear witness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The old woman looked at her descendant. And the other [Ladies] drew back. Lady Zanthia found Eliasor and the young girls under her tutelage. She spoke, as she watched Maviola. And Eliasor saw Zanthia's face. Longing, and afraid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Look at her, Eliasor, young [Ladies]. And hope that you have half her grace as you pass. I do. And remember. Those who enter into a covenant with the Temptress are not worthy of walking in her shadow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola sat alone in her wheelchair. The old woman's fingers slipped on the cork of the vial as she tried to open it. At last, Desinee helped her. Maviola grunted, irritably. Then she looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I have been planning my end a long time. I do not have the will to cling to life. Nor the interest to spend my years waning. I have lived. Made mistakes. I have many regrets. But it ends as it should, with time. I did not know it would be today. I did not know how I would die. I still do not. But I do not intend to &lt;em&gt;waste&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt;. To die quietly."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She raised the vial with a trembling hand. The women looked as Maviola brought it closer to her lips. She spoke, quietly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I am Lady Maviola El. And this is the death &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;choose."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She drank the entire vial down. A full potion's dose. Ieka gasped. And she saw the old woman change. Her features shifted. In a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;One second, an old woman sat in the chair. The next—Ieka blinked. And she saw a woman standing there, regarding her dress. Someone else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A young woman with sparkling orange hair, like embers, mixed with black. She had a smile made of mischief and passion, and her eyes blazed. She turned, and Desinee was the older of the two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Grandmother…?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A laughter, infectious, crackling with humor. The young woman stretched.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That's only what you call me, Desinee. But all my life? I've been Maviola. And—I've forgotten how it feels to stand. Look at me."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;With some dismay she looked at her body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"My clothes don't fit. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; I forgot to prepare for. But enough, enough. I have my bag of holding. And that is enough."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She twirled. And the [Ladies] looked at her. Magnolia Reinhart blinked. Bethal nudged Pryde.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I did not expect that. I thought she was going to sell it. Isn't that a waste of money?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;The [Lady] smiled. She looked at Bethal and turned around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"This is my selfishness. I told you, I've prepared for this day for decades. With my own funds. Look. Magnolia, you were only one more piece to my ending. And for that, I thank you. Even the Stitch Witch in her way. But I have been prepared."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She reached for her side. And pulled out the three objects she always carried with her. And Ieka's jaw dropped. Because she saw three glowing vials. Each the same color.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Three potions. Each the same as the last. Even Magnolia blinked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Saliss of Lights sells his potions rarely. But he does sell a number of them. I used only the money I had. Nothing remains but this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Maviola El looked at the three vials. Each one a Potion of Youth. Temporary Youth. She looked around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Each one will last a week. And after that?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She spread her arms. And she smiled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"That is all. But it is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; ending. Youth, a dream. Now, look at me, Desinee. Magnolia Reinhart, you [Ladies] of Izril. I am Lady Maviola El. And I relinquish my position as leader of the House of El. I give it to Lord Deilan El."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A gasp from Desinee. And the [Ladies] stirred. Maviola turned her head. Looking around. Staring at the ground, the sky, as if it was all new again. She turned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"What will you do with your time? My estates are open, and my carriage, if you have any wish."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Magnolia looked at Maviola respectfully. The [Lady] laughed, younger than Magnolia by half. Almost scornfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I don't need wealth. I want something else. Something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. I will not trouble any of you. I am no longer of the House of El. I will be just Maviola. I will be…"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She paused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"I had a name, once. A nickname. '&lt;em&gt;Lady Firestarter'. &lt;/em&gt;That was what they called me, when I was a girl. But only I remember why. Yet, for a moment, let me be her again. Goodbye, all of you. I hope you live the lives you want."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Nothing more. She turned and began walking out of the field. And the [Ladies] of Izril—knelt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;They curtsied, or bowed, some of them. And they knelt as the young woman passed them by. To age, to the passing of the House of El's scion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;To her. And a word that Ieka held in her house, that chased away Belavierr's whispers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grace.&lt;/em&gt; Maviola El walked. She left her years behind. And she strode over to a hitched, waiting horse, and mounted it as nimbly as could be. It had no saddle; the horse danced as she steadied it. Then she began to ride away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;South. Smiling and laughing in the night. The [Ladies] watched. In silence, in awe, in mourning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Only one voice broke the silence. And it was Bethal's. She started. And exclaimed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;"Oh. She stole my horse."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;—-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;On Maviola rode, on burning, magical time. To find her death. Leaving her life behind. &lt;em&gt;South.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She rode like fire, her hair, black and orange, waving in the wind. Lady Firestarter. Lady El. A figure from an old tale, another era, riding into the night. Out of her story and into another for one last time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She passed a shadow in the night. A walking monster. A [Witch]. The banished figure turned her head. And she whispered. Her voice rose as shadows circled Maviola.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: DO NOT EXIST"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;You have left your lands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; You are dying. I can let you live forever.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;A nightmare's voice. Reaching hands. An immortal stare. Maviola turned her head. And in the midnight's darkness, she raised her hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Fire blooming in the night. Belavierr screamed as the magical fire, made of memory shot into the sky. And Maviola El laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;She rode on, then. A glowing ember blazing against the wind. Burning brightest in the night before the dawn. And it wasn't the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em"&gt;Not yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">485802</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:02:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/syndication/10073</link><description>Latest updates of (The Wandering Inn)</description></rss>
