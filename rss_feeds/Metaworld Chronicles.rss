Across the operating table, her machine-nurse, Rosemary, a low-tier healer trained in offering support to her betters, watched with mouth half-open as she went about a two-surgeon operation solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presently, Kiki, her Alraune, kept their patient well-sedated and securely tethered to the table with a proliferation of tendrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wound looks clean," Elvia spoke to her imaginary co-surgeon. She was used to operating without aides-de-camp. Things had not been easy at GOS since Director Astor left to pursue her political venture, nor were they better here at Nightingale. In the beginning, she had moped in Sylvie's arms, but over time, she grew accustomed to the cold shoulders. If anything, she considered the proliferation of low-tier Mages and NoMs assigned to her a badge of honour. Her lack of malpractice had annoyed the blue-bloods to no end, but there was little else her bullies could do in case Lady Astor materialised again to enact a new round of Purges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Healing Word!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gentle suffusion overcame her patient's open wound, a broken femur resulting from a drunken, late-night meeting with a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia focused the viridescent vitality gathered near her fingers. "Sen-sen, follow my lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her right hand, she directed the Ginseng's prehensile whiskers to remove the debris still embedded in the flesh. Sen-sen wasn't as skilled as Kiki, who was experienced by now, but as her Familiar, its Empathic Link guaranteed ease of communication. Concurrently, with her left, Elvia stabbed at the ruined flesh with jolts of healing energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thrill coursed through Elvia's veins as she conjoined the broken bone. Simply put, it was a pleasure to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underneath her steady lay-on-hands, the man moaned as the tissue of his thighs rapidly began to regenerate. The itch that resulted from magical healing, no matter how repressed, was something that tugged at the soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ma'am." The nurse offered a sheet of gauze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia glanced up. A curious anomaly the Ginseng's vitality affected was the ability to uplift a certain offensive organ. In Oriental medicine, the plant was considered "Yang", which Elvia took to mean vigorous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Sen-sen, lower the dosage. Rosemary, can you cover that up? It's in the way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, Ma'am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beginning suture," she informed the machine-nurse. "Kiki, keep him still."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A glamour from Kiki was enough to send the man back into the void for another five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine-nurse obediently handed over one tool after another. Elvia threaded the hair-thin tendril generated by her Ginseng Familiar through the incision, well-practised after hundreds of sutured bananas, grapes, and NoMs. Once in motion, her hands moved like little white butterflies, working the wound to see the dermis restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good. We're done. Please clean up." Elvia withdrew her Familiars. "Heart-rate is depressed. Blood Pressure normal. Blood oxygen saturation is holding. Thanks, Rose. Give him a 5mmg Remove Disease immuno-infusion once he's settled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My pleasure, Dr Lindholm." The machine-nurse wiped the blood from the patient's leg, revealing only a pink scar. The perfection of the heal was enough to draw a gasp. "Ma'am, how did you do that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Practice?" Elvia stepped back with both hands raised. "Sterilise! — Okay, I am going to make a cuppa, yourself?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll keep an eye on the patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her heart still singing, she ducked into the break room, where already, a big jug of English Breakfast simmered on the stove. She poured herself a cup, added milk and sugar, then checked her Message band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six missed Messages. But Elvia didn't much feel like returning them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the pale hospital light, she began to mull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her resounding success with her present patients had thoroughly validated the Yinglong's generosity. Sen-sen was an amazing boon to her Affinity in more ways than one. Never in her life, never in any medical books, had she heard of a newly-bonded Spirit Familiar having both high-ability and unwavering obedience. For instance, though her Alraune followed her lead, communication errors, disagreements and incomprehension of context often resulted in less than sterling results. With Sen-sen however, she had acquired a simulacrum, one with which she could generate as many pairs of helping hands as her concentration could muster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control, the finesse, the exactitude offered by Sen-sen was orgasmic compared to the primitive prodding afforded by vague fingers or rune-scripted surgical tools. As a practitioner of magical medicine, she could imagine a future where, if she possessed the knowledge, no injury was an obstacle. If a Mage wasn't dead on arrival, she could arguably keep their biometrics above the threshold. If they were— she could even enact the kiss-of-life Gwen had performed on Magister Walken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the blessing of restoration wasn't free, and for this Elvia could not help but envision Gwen's bitter face while she revealed her new patron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was her action a form of betrayal? Elvia had wondered after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Gwen, perhaps. But not to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without the Yinglong's divine intervention, she wanted the means to achieve her desire, one her mother, her uncle, and their parents had harkened after— the Hand of God. Given the opportunity, why shouldn't she resolutely accept the personal cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With complete empathy, she understood her companion's emotions— for all her vulnerability, Gwen's affection was like a rolling, all-consuming tide. And like a moody sea, Gwen was full of ebbs and flows, hiding a Kraken beneath her undertow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wanted to change the future, even though her patron said there was no diverting the Yangtze of fate. Whatever will happen— will happen, and the best a demi-god or she or anyone could do was fudging the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who was to die? &lt;br/&gt;Who was to live? &lt;br/&gt;Who was to grieve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a matter of delicacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she were to beg the Oracle of Delphi, the Seeress would say that no matter the histronics, Troy would burn, Agamemnon would die, and Priam would be made mince.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if an actor could stay Pyrrhus' wrath for just an hour, then perhaps a hundred souls could flee his coal-eyed rampage. If another could keep the gore-clad avenger pinned at the palace, maybe Polyxena may live, and possibly Polites' blood need not pollute Zeus' marbled palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the boon the Yinglong had offered her, a seed of subversion. She would be the stone to trouble the yellow river of predestination, even a little bit, and in exchange, she would be the Yinglong's Vessel to overlook the Calamity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why was Gwen the Calamity? Shouldn't the calamitous sorceress be Elizabeth Sobel? Already, the Void Witch had consumed whole cities, resulting in the death of untold thousands, consumed human and Demi-humans, maybe even Dragons, alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thy Sobel art merely a seed-spawned ivy strangling the princely trunk that once nourished her." The Yinglong's thoughts had boomed across the toiling firmament. "The Calamity is uncertainty, an anomaly, usurping the fate of others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, Elvia had begged for clarity, but the Yinglong spoke only in riddles, as was expected of a being older than the Nazarene— older than western civilisation. All it could promise was that when the time came, when the divergent rivulets of destiny coalescence over that fateful battlefield, she would make a choice, and it would matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the power which Sen-sen bestowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Magnificent one, may I inform Gwen?" She had demanded of the Yinglong. "If she usurps fate, won't she be able to change the fate of millions?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mayhap the Calamity will trouble the river more than most," the great voice reverberated within her skull. "But the burden of change art for thee to bear. If thou wilt dispose mine divine vision, then so be it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an answer Elvia took to mean that if she changed enough of the future, then the exact location of the vision, as well as the participants involved, would change beyond recognition. Tianjin would fall, the Undead would rise, but she would not know where Percy was, or Gwen, or Richard, or Lulan, or Golos. What good then, would the foresight do? Who could she save?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Great Dragon." She had taken as much liberty as she dared. "What does it mean that Gwen consumes the fate of others?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thou should question thy Devourer" The Yinglong began to settle back into its long slumber. "Coax from thy Calamity the truth of her cruel conception, if thou would risk thine curiosity. But recall, Vessel, that thou art destined to restore mine child. This, thou wilt perform above all else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a duty Elvia had promised to deliver, though presently, her mental map remained incomplete. So many questions remained from the vision. Why were they in China? What happened to Uncle Jun? Why did Percy, Gwen's coddled brother, turn into a monster? Why did fire, flood and Undead simultaneously unleash upon Tianjin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DING! DING!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"DR LINDHOLM, please respond." The crimson Message Glyph bloomed beside Elvia's ear. "You are needed in Emergency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia tipped her tea and disappeared her tea set into the Storage Ring Gwen had given her. She felt the weight of the Contingency Ring acutely on her ring finger as well, a symbolism her friend had not previously noticed, which had made her dejected for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am here!" Elvia saw the gurney before it arrived at her station. "What's the status?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine-nurse passed over the data slate. "Code Orange. Spider Curse. Acute pulmonary interference. In situ Weiss-Hermann portable Ventilator via trach. Infusions of 5mg of Prilosec PAC, 1mg Stirgenix and 12mg Ipratropium compounded with 30-70 W-S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia's eyes browsed the transfer papers, then looked down at the patient, Magus William Fitzgerald of Kildare, holder of the Queen's Gallantry Cross. The man's body, what's left of it, was a sunken, sallow husk of a human being. For a Combat Mage to live so long and fruitfully from the 70s was itself a small miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's unwell." Elvia replaced the slate, realising her higher-up's ploy. "Shall I ease his discomfort until the surgical team arrives?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, Dr Lindholm. You are to heal him," the machine-nurse related the orders from the head surgeon with sparkling eyes. "Magus Fitzgerald is in your care, Dr Lindholm. Please confirm the handover and nominate your staff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia recognised the churlish tone. It told her more than she needed to know— more than the hidden condition of her patient, at any rate. Magus Fitzgerald was not likely going to survive his ordeal, not when the Spider-Curse required an open cardiothoracic operation involving individual manipulation of major organs. From what she could see, merely attempting a thoracotomy of the pleural cavity would put the Magus six-feet-under. Even if they managed, resuscitative efforts would likely fail due to the Magus' spent vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She met the nurse's smug eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see," Elvia confirmed the handover Glyph, then Messaged her colleague. "Dr Witherspoon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry, Elvia, I am a bit preoccupied here," came the reply a moment later. "Perhaps ask for someone from the ICU?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia rang a few more of her stationed colleagues, each providing an excuse or were occupied in actuality. Feeling a cold stab of ice in her chest, she considered her options. Some of the staff she could beg, some others she could commandeer. What she needed was someone to clarify her limited knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it weren't so soon since the new year, she could ask Sylvie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or if Emily had been here, her friend would bring a whole gaggle of healers, both senior and junior, who would grudgingly aid their mistress's "pet".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sylvia was away up north in Scotland, and Emily was back with her family. As for the other Doctors, they would only fight her if Kiki and Sen-sen took their place. In that case, Magus Fitzgerald was as good as dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You," Elvia's lips pronounced as her eyes scanned over the self-satisfied handover nurse. Many of the senior nurses were more knowledgable than the doctors; what they lacked was magical talent. "You can be my assistant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… What?" the machine-nurse, whose name-tag read "Georgia Fields", spluttered. "I am Dr Hope's assistant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And now you're mine." Elvia pulled back her lips so that she showed teeth, a habit that Gwen often affected. "What's wrong? Magus Fitzgerald doesn't have time to squander."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I…" The woman was sweating. Elvia knew the healer of middling-talent didn't have the authority to refuse her demand. Each Doctor had their assistants and aides not because of official assignment, but because of preference and habit. Whatever her excuse, the hospital's hierarchy was absolute. "I need to return to Magus Hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't you want to save the Magus? The note here says he expects me to do my utmost. Well. Ergo, I command you to stay and aid me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman gulped. "Who… else is with us?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one." Elvia placed her hand on the forehead of her patient. "Its just you and me, nurse Fields."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're insane!" The woman's eyes widened. "You're trying to drag me down with you!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Am I?" Elvia cocked her head. "Is Magus Fitzgerald going to die?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No! But…" Her eyes darted back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Follow me. Or not. It's our positions on the line." Elvia commanded. "Kiki!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her Alraune leapt from her pocket to rest atop the gurney. "Keep nurse Fields close, and keep Magus Fitzgerald sedated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kiki!" The floral Sprite twirled, sprinkling the unique sorcery of her species over the weakly breathing Magus. A few more tendrils, green and wax with new buds, teased the machine-nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bless! Aid!" Elvia bolstered the man's vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the diagnostic panel, the Magus' biometrics stabilised. It was a temporary boost, one that would fail as soon as the spell's duration rang out. Nonetheless, Elvia was confident Sen-sen's bolstered buffs could remain active for at least twenty-four hours— for such was the efficacy attained by having a demi-divinity strengthen one's access to the Positive Plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Nurse Fields confused and tottering on the verge of blind panic behind her, Elvia savoured the peculiar satisfaction she felt for her tormentor's internal agony, wondering if this was what Gwen observed when Consuming her foes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, both passed the sterilising threshold of the operating theatre. Vivian, Elvia's former machine-nurse, appeared with a fresh supply of sanitised tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dr Lindholm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You sit this one out, Rose," Elvia commanded her sympathiser to leave, leaving Nurse Field on the verge of breathless asphyxiation. "Fields— dress me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really must protest." Fields made no move, perhaps realising this was her final chance. "I need to return to Magus Hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NOW, Miss Fields!" Elvia knew that she would call upon Sen-sen's abilities, but had not expected that the first time she would utilise it would be against her nurses. Inexpert and with poor focus, a wave of Dragon Fear radiated from her petite body, turning her already ultramarine eyes so blue that her audience grew bedazzled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary, being spared the brunt of Elvia's intimidation, took several steps backwards, then fled from the theatre. Nurse Field stood ram-rod straight and stiff as a board, appearing as though every nerve had fired at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"M-Ma'am!" the nurse stammered, then almost without thought, pulled open the scrubs and dressed Elvia with trembling hands. "I, I obey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the sake of keeping your bowels dignified, please don't deny me again, Nurse Fields." She nixed the Essence-tap so that no more gut-clenching fear twisted her victim's spine. A surge of guilt coursed through Elvia's chest, battling the unbidden happiness leaking from somewhere unseen. "Please lend me your knowledge. We have a hero to save."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magister Amanda Hatchley had received the news too late that a Gallant Cross recipient had been delivered to her beloved college, and knew that her arrival at London would prove a fruitless formality. Still, it was her desire, her duty even, to ensure that some poor sod from her school did not suffer the consequences of degrading failure when a futile request had been laid across their lap. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She didn't mind the "black mark". Come budget-time; there would be plenty of alumnae defending the college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, as an administrator, she was wary that should the students perceive their instructors as willing to push them under the Golem, the moral implication would impact morale. Thereby, once she found whoever the hell decided to pass Fitzgerald on to the provisional medics, a public shaming would be in order. Her only hope was that her culprit, likely a third-son or daughter, did not have the clout to get away with so blatant a deflection of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ma'am, we're here," her driver unobtrusively reminded his mistress of their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatchley alighted from the saloon like a storm on heels. Hospital Directors often suffered short-lived holidays, but hers had died from malpractice within forty-eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lobby, she hailed the first Matron to cross her path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sal!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Hatchley?" the older woman paused. "What's the matter?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where's the patient?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Magus Fitzgerald! Gallant Cross! Is he dead?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ma'am?" The Matron appeared confused. "We haven't heard a death knell since last week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Hatchley stopped in her tracts. She could hardly believe it. The bleating goats are hiding mortuary reports now? Was that why no one could answer her Messaged enquiries? Who did they think they could fool? "Take me to Emergency. Bring me an audit report of all incoming and goings since this morning's shift."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, Director."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatchley tapped her foot the whole agonising two minutes it took for the levitation platform to descend and take her down to Emergency. Nightingale, as a teaching hospital, was not equipped with the sprawling Emergency rooms usually seen in the Great Hospitals like Royal Alfreds. Theirs was a three-theatre affair, with no more than thirty beds available, of which no more than ten had attendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside, the atmosphere was not at all what she had anticipated. &lt;br/&gt;There was no anxiety, no grim faces, no Matrons in a huff. &lt;br/&gt;Instead, everything appeared business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where's Magus Fitzgerald?" she demanded of the desk nurse, who quickly rose halfway through a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ward 3, Ma'am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Hatchley wasted no time. Such was her fury that a conga-line of nurses and a few junior doctors followed her from the levitation platform down to the section housing the Intensive Care Recovery rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as she was through the door, she caught a headful of perfume smelling like fresh lilies. Dispelling the scent with her hand, she pulled back the curtain, expecting more than anything to see an empty bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, a stunned, half-naked old Mage with greying hair with a half-shaved chest stared back at her, mid-way through picking at the pink scars crossing his chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… Excuse you, ma'am." The man slowly pulled up his surgical gown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… Magus Fitzgerald?" Hatchley's eyes swerved to the diagnostic panel. The blood pressure and heart rate were all within acceptable parameters. The oxygenation was well over ninety per cent!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aye, tis I." the Magus' hinted strongly of his place of origin. "You are?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Amanda Hatchley, Nightingale's College."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A pleasure then." The man extended a hand. The two shook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Hatchley wanted to ask why the man was alive and well, but the proposal proved too absurd for the present. "I am happy to see you're doing well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A wee too well." the Magus took a deep breath. "I haven't breathed like this since… I can't recall, really, not since the Boers struck me with that corrosive Cloud Kill. We got the blondies back though, kicked up Firestorm from up on high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"May I?" Hatchley indicated to the spectrographic metre on the wall. "I wish to confirm your health if that's alright with you, sir. A thorough head to toe, if you may permit me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go ahead." Magus Fitzgerald's face took on a dreamy look. "Quite the Cleric you've got there, the blonde girl. A celestial, hahaha. When I woke, I had thought the Lord's Angels had come for me. Yer know— we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need one like her at the Isle. Is she battlefield trained? Knighted?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One moment, Sir William. Who is the Magus' attending physician?" Hatchley turned to the Matron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dr Lindholm, ma'am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Elvia?" A vision of fine, flaxen hair demurely drifted across Amanda Hatchley's mind's eye. "Where is she now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… in theatre, Ma'am. There's an NoM patient Dr Witherspoon did not wish to operate on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is?" Hatchley raised a brow. If she, as an upper-tier physician, had been present to perform Fitzgerald's operation, she would have been exhausted by now. Did the girl utilise Faith? If so, where was she collecting it? "That's admirable. I'll stay here with Magus Fitzgerald."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her attention returned to the Magus. "I'll make the enquires, Magus Fitzgerald. For now, please relax. Eye of Discernment!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Director swept her all-seeing vision through the Magus' body. The trachea had healed admirably with minimal scarring of the oesophagus. The right lung remained absent, meaning Elvia had not regenerated one from scratch. The bronchi tubes were cleared of the Spider-Curse's ruination, as well as old growths. The left lung was presently functioning under the auspice of a restored pleural membrane, flushed with oxygenated blood from vibrant pulmonary vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, where the intercostal musculature married the diaphragm, obstructive scarring from prior injuries had been suppressed. The work was far from the hand of God, but it was the sort a senior healer might achieve with a small team of specialists; that or a Relic-Attuned Cleric empowered by Faith. Elvia Lindholm, to her knowledge, was neither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who was with Elvia?" she turned to her Matron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nurse Fields, Ma'am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I meant the attending specialists." Hatchley cocked her head. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"How's it look?" Below her data slate, Magus Fitzgerald appeared to delight in the very act of breathing. "How long have I got?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I fear you have more to give to the Mageocracy," Hatchley stated with a tone of complete seriousness. "Your respiratory system is delicate, but only compared to a completely healthy Mage sans sustained injury such as yours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magus Fitzgerald's brows furrowed. "That's… impossible, you know. I was at Black's. They said it could not be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is done now." Hatchley did her best to keep a straight face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Magus' expression grew hearty. "When can I go back to the Isle? I have friends there, students, Apprentices, still fighting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatchley nodded. "Matron, who was with Dr Lindholm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Matron gulped. "… Just Nurse Fields. Ma'am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The room was suddenly hushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are there recordings of the surgery?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, Director."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Send them to my office." The Director of Nightingale's teaching wing felt her scalp crawl. "Magus Fitzgerald, I would advise one more day on restoratives. Matron, as soon as Elvia is done, send her over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen had half a mind to teleport to London when after almost a day, Elvia still hasn't returned her Messages. The anticipation was making her hungrier than ever, shocking even Richard when they caught up for luncheon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When, after two family-sized shepherd's pies, she privately explained the ordeal to her cousin, he disappointingly declined to comment on Elvia's condition, citing that one should not piss off the boss's boss. Instead, he spoke at length about the Isle, the Dwarves soon to arrive, and his willingness to serve as her poxy in regards to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am good with NoMs," Richard sold his services over a cold stout. "Let me at 'em. And the paper press! What a brilliant idea! You've been a busy bee, cousin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But inevitably, the conversation returned to that of Elvia. What could the girl be doing? She demanded of Richard. Even if Evee's working, surely she could take a Message and fire off a quick response?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have you thought Elvia might be busy doing her things?" Richard politely interjected after the fifth complaint. "You know, like you? Like me? Having— like, goals?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was the end of their luncheon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour later, with Richard back at King's, the distraction caused by Elvia's lack of response ballooned. Gwen felt such repression that she could hardly concentrate on Magus Keridwen Le Guevel's lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that it was interesting— the Magus was getting her to memorise the history of England and musical chair of Noble Houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far, her instructor had been very patient with her disinclined pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's take a pause." Le Guevel replaced the dictionary-sized edition of Twurp's Peerage of England and the Kingdom. "What a face you're making, Gwen. Remember the basics when dealing with Nobles. Don't let your true emotions show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know, I know…" Gwen sighed. When it came to money, she could play poker with the best of them, but when it came to the matter of interpersonal relationships, her face took on a life of its own in the worst manner. When she was deliriously happy, she grinned and laughed and smiled to excess. When the mood soured, her bitch-face could cure meat into biltong. "What am I to do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Try smiling, dear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen grinned for the imaginary cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Try to smile with your eyes. Disconnect it from the thoughts in your head. Its a masquerade. Your face should be calm like a lake, static, placid, reflective— oh Gods." Magus Le Guevel snorted when Gwen fluttered her lashes. "My dear, you reminded me of a short-changed whore in Soho trying to coax an extra florin from a tight-fisted John."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… I am sorry, what?" Gwen performed a double-take. A flush of heat touched her cheeks. Had her ears deceived her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her instructor's smile was pure wickedness. Where the Magus had been a Victoriana flower, she promptly grew smokey and alluring. There was something about the woman's expressive eyes that hinted at hidden and exciting things, making Gwen's heart palpitate. "Did that wake our kitten up?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shouldn't you be instructing me on social propriety?" Gwen furrowed her brows. "That was a bit crass, don't you think? What would your nobles think?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Poor kitty." Le Guevel's amusement proved as annoying as it was disarming. "I knew you weren't paying attention. Lady Grey didn't employ me to teach you how to be polite, Guinevere, I am here to teach you how to be..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Guevel twirled a finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Be what?" Gwen was now wide awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her instructor wetted her lips ever so slightly. With no discernible change to the setting of the library's tutor room, the atmosphere had shifted toward that of a sleazy jazz saloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... &lt;em&gt;Limber,&lt;/em&gt; dear. How to be more &lt;em&gt;limber."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">502901</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 11:09:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Glossary</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/501870</link><description>&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"&gt;Sanctioned Schools of Magic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.3em; color: rgba(153, 153, 153, 1)"&gt;(Sigils by Lampshade)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/2b85nMm.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Evocation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly awakened school in modern Spellcraft, Evocation is a school that manipulates energy. Evokers become the mainstay of the citizen-soldiers, wielding spells of Fire, Earth, Water, and more exotic elements such as Lightning or Radiance. As Evokers mature, they become more specialised in a particular elemental affinity, taking up specialist equipment, attunement and contract Spirits. In the media and propaganda, the Evoker is the archetype Mage, the spell slinging, fireball blasting Sorcerer of yore, tapping into and drawing limitless power from the elemental planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/54Xa3Cc.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Abjuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abjurers weave spells that protect, block, dispel or banish. An Abjurer is a common but highly sought after profession. Abjuration made Shielding Stations possible. An Abjurer possesses the unique ability to utilise restoration spells such as De-Curse and the ability to dispense protective AOE combat buffs. Specialists in this field typically contract elementals of earth, ice, and water, all of which are relatively common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conjuration is a school that materialises creatures or materials for the caster. A Conjurer becomes a one-man army after mastering higher tiers of Magic. Through Familiar rituals and or contracting Magical Creatures, Conjurers gain life-long companions that grow with the Mage in power. Due to this advantage, it is not uncommon for Summoners to become several magnitudes more powerful than Mages of equal tier. The disadvantage of Conjuration is the persistent mana drain caused by most of its sustained effect spells and crippling loss of combat potential to specialised Abjuration such as Banish. Certain Conjurers choose to focus on the summoning of items or beings. These valuable individuals are also responsible for the Teleportation Circles around the cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/luJKtxr.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Divination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diviners reveal information. They are highly prized for their cognisant abilities in detection and foretelling. Many diviners go on to become telecommunication specialists, becoming key intelligence and strategist operatives who serve a multitude of critical roles. Other schools of Divination focuse on disaster deterrence, by reading the threads of time and fate. Despite their lack of offensive capabilities, it is said that the most influential Magi on the United Nations Council is the Oracle of the Acropolis. Though the Divination school has no preference for elemental afflictions, it is a school that synergises well with subsequent studies of other schools. Many Diviners go on to become Magus or Magister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/WZkxC3a.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Enchantment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school of Enchantment remains the most difficult and expensive to train of all schools. Capable of imbuing items and buildings with protection, strengthening materials and extending persist phenomena - Enchanters are essential to humanity's cities. The world's most successful manufactoriums and artisanal workshops are all operated by skilled Enchanters. Unlike regular Mages, many Enchanters seek to master additional schools such as Transmutation or Abjuration for the creation of magical items. A dangerous school within-a-school of Enchanters are those whose abilities allow them to control, manipulate, and glamour the minds of others. Mind Mages are closely watched by government forces, for the misuse of mind-altering effects on others could lead to life-imprisonment or banishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/hg5cY37.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Illusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illusion is the magic of mirage, the altering of perceptions to create false visions. Many Illusionists go on to become involved in espionage if they choose the path of the militant. Many others, however, have elected media and entertainment, creating spectacles for adoring audiences, becoming superstars of immense prestige. Illusion spells which deal damage attack the mind directly, creating what is known as psychic feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/BJhWXZ0.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Transmutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transmutation is an unusual school in that it changes the caster and the objects they touch, manipulating the properties in powerful ways. In the present world, Transmuters become builders, architects and creators, working hand-in-glove with Enchanters. In combat, some Transmuters choose to specialise in manipulating life itself, changing plants, creatures, and even themselves to become deadly and proficient in the art of war. It is said that Transmuters posses the most versatile school of all and enjoy the most lauded status after that of Evokers. An overall well-rounded School of Magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="48" src="https://imgur.com/Ys9pKEb.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="235"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Biomancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clerical School of Healing Magic has always existed in human history in one form or another. Some say that this was the original 'School' of magic. In Modern Spellcraft, Clerical magic exists between Conjuration and Evocation, and is considered a 'hybrid school of magic'. Exclusively, Biomancy requires Mages attuned to the Positive Energy Plane. The combination of Healing Magic and Positive Energy often shrouds the Biomancer with a 'halo' of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5em"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dreaded School of Necromancy was banned after WWI following the Geneva Convention. Currently, the school is studied only by Sects authorised by the U.N, arguing that the study of souls and the afterlife is inseparably connected to matters of faith, culture and religion. For many scholars, the irony of the matter is that Necromancy is most likely the most ancient school of magic in the world; dating back to the Egyptian Pharaohs, in an age when man first uncovered magic. As such, it is more accurate to say that the summoning, raising, and animation of the dead is strictly forbidden, as much of the old world had turned into ash and cinder following The Great War with the Undead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/xJGXTPm.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="235"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(153, 153, 153, 1)"&gt;Post Note: Other schools of magic likely exist but lie beyond the reach of the ordinary Mage. These include Faith Magic, ancestral worship, old world shamanism, naturalism, animalism, and so forth. By the same measure, rumours of humans learning the magic of monsters, magical beings, and demi-humanoids, or Demi-humans learning Human Spellcraft abound.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"&gt;Elements &amp;amp; Elemental Magic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"&gt;&lt;img height="1067" src="https://i.imgur.com/UXhMKeQ.png" width="800"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.8em; color: rgba(153, 153, 153, 1)"&gt;by Me (best with white background)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.1em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Material Plane (The Material Realm)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left"&gt;The Primary Elements of the Material Plane are what Astrologists propose our world is made from. It is the very stuff of existence itself, existing in perfect harmony. It is suggested that when a Mage is attuned to a certain element, it is because that an excessive element is present within their body. Though exceedingly rare, there exist individuals who are born capable of tapping into all four Prime Elements, becoming mages capable of manipulating 'wood' and other natural phenomena, hypothesised by Eastern Spellcraft as an individual element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Energy Planes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Positive Plane -&lt;/strong&gt; The Plane of Positive Energy is a place of pure life-force, it is where the healers draw their power to heal and mend one's broken bones. The Undead are fearful of this energy, and the unwary caster should be as well. Too much positive power without the ability to channel it may lead to strange mutations and cancerous tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative Energy -&lt;/strong&gt; Where Positive is life, Negative is death. The Undead are tethered to this plane, drawing their undead lifeforce from this domain. When 'living' creatures utilise Negative Energy, they suffer Negative Drain, rapidly diminishing vitality. In the old days, the Mage world saw the Negative Energy as just another source of power. After WWI, Necromancy became highly controversial, gaining a dangerous reputation as a forbidden craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prime Elemental Planes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth&lt;/strong&gt; - Earth is one of the most useful and common elements awakening in Human Mages, it is the element responsible for most of our industry, mining for Mana Crystals, building our cities, and so on. It is said that one-fifth of Mages awaken as Earthen Mages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air&lt;/strong&gt; - The Elemental Plane of Air, as the name suggests, a place of gases and open space, frequently filled with thunderstorms, blizzards, microbursts, tornadoes and all manners of interesting weather phenomenona. Of the four common Elemental Affinities, Air is the rarest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire&lt;/strong&gt; - Fire is another common element Mages manifest. Ancient legend has it that Fire was stolen from the Gods themselves. With Fire, man has created many useful tools and beaten back tides of monstrous creatures. Fire is another common element for Mages to possess and the mainstay of Combat Evokers, Transmuters and Conjurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water&lt;/strong&gt; - Assumed to be a near-infinite volume of water, this Elemental Plane is pivotal to the survival of modern magical cities. The Plane provides Human cities with its supply of fresh water. Likewise, human cities pump its waste-water back into the Elemental Plane. It is theorised that the Oceans are directedly connected to this Elemental Plane. Water Affinity is exceptionally common among coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Para-Elemental Planes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ice&lt;/strong&gt; - Ice is the most common Para-Element to awaken in Mages. It is a supremely useful element that creates drops in temperature - being a combination of Air and Water. The Plane of Ice is said to be a tumbling expanse of frigidity with islands of glacial ice. Ice provides good defence and offence capabilities, as well as chill and slow effects against water-based enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ooze&lt;/strong&gt; - Ooze is a stranger element, scarce and virtually non-existent outside of isolated magical bloodlines. Ooze Mages are specialists, pending on their school, with spells that focus on entrapment, debilitation, poison, and other strange and mysterious effects. A speciality of the Ooze Conjurer is the ability to summon creatures that exist within that elemental plane - Oozes. It is theorised that some oozes are virtually indestructible except by other Specialist Mages. Ooze is the combination of Water and Earth. Mud is a derivative of Ooze, though far closer to the Elemental Plane of Water than true Ooze Mages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magma&lt;/strong&gt; - The Magma Mage is unique indeed; a rare combination of Fire and Earth. These Mages are typically found where there are volcanic islands or fjords. Their power combines the physical prowess of the Earth Mage, with the damage potential of the Fire Mage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoke&lt;/strong&gt; - Smoke is the marriage of Air and Fire. Smoke is an element that is said to only exist in legend. Very little is known about Smoke Mages or the Para-Elemental Plane of Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mineral&lt;/strong&gt; - Mineral Mages take their capabilities in the form of specialised mineral or metal to which the caster is attuned. As such, the Element creates distinct abilities that differ from Mage to Mage. A Mage capable of summoning volcanic stones, for instance, would generate obsidian shards which are brittle and fragile but possess dangerous offensive capabilities. Jedite Mages create powerful super-dense defensive layers. There are rumours that King Midas was a Gold Mage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lightning&lt;/strong&gt; - Existing between the Air and Positive Elemental planes, Lighting is the most penetrative of all elements due to its electrical nature. Lightning causes stun and paralysis, in addition to manifesting instantly and delivering payloads in a fraction of a second. Lightning Mages are preferably Evokers, Conjurers or Transmuters. The Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning is said to be a place of plasma, ozone and endless thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam&lt;/strong&gt; - Where the Positive and Water Elemental Planes meet, one gets Steam. Steam is a rarely seen element. Only a handful of Mages are on record as having tapped into a Goldilocks' zone where two Elements meet in harmony. There is little known about the Plane and its Elementalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiance&lt;/strong&gt; - Radiance is formed from Fire and Positive energy. Often mistaken as the power of Light. In theory, it should be useless, too scattered to be used offensively - too dispersed to be used defensively. It takes a special Mage, therefore, to change something so immaterial into a powerful projection of destruction. At a certain intensity, Radiance is capable of melting through solid steel, boiling blood, searing flesh, and severing matter. Not much is known about the Elemental Plane of Radiance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash&lt;/strong&gt; - A derivative of Negative-Fire that manifests corrosive ash and black flames. The most destructive element in the array of Elemental Planes. Ash Mages rarely live long as the Element eats away at their minds. It is said that Ash Mages exist as tortured existences whose ruinous powers rack their bodies with unbelievable pain. If one is Negative Drained by an Ash Mage, one loses one's seven emotions and six desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dust&lt;/strong&gt; - Dust is the most stable of the Negative Quasi-elements, next to Salt. It doesn't have any offensive capabilities of its own but enjoys the same corrosive ability drain as Ash. The most annoying part of fighting a Dust Mage is their ability to deaden all elemental damage. Due to its abrogating nature, Dust consumes Fire, Water, Air, Lightning, even Ash. It is said to be the most stalwart Abjuration Affinity next to Mineral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt&lt;/strong&gt; - Salt is a stable Negative Quasi-element, with the additional ability to form into a range of crystalline shapes. It's capable of dealing extreme damage to Slimes and Oozes, as well as an assortment of creatures composed mostly of water - including Humans. The desiccation caused by the Salt Mage draws out elemental water from the bodies of their enemies. Elemental Salt is different from mortal salt, found in oceans and sometimes in rocks; it is formed where Negative Energy and Water meet. Salt is the least destructive of Negative Quasi-elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Void&lt;/strong&gt; - As the name suggests, the Elemental Plane of Void is a place of vast, perpetual darkness, where strange, forgotten things lurk in a vacuum darker than black, always hungering. It is a Plane consisting of the very idea of nothingness, a place where forgotten things end up. When manifested in the Material Plane, Void consumes matter, then disappears. Like Steam and Smoke Mages, very little is known about Void Mages. Arguably, the most famous Void Mage in Modern History is Elizabeth Sobel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em; color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"&gt;Spellcraft and Metaworld Glossary &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.1em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astral Body&lt;/strong&gt; - The cognitively generated projection of one's connection to the Multiverse, visualised via indoctrinated Spellcraft. Typically manifests as a humanoid silhouette with abstract details pertaining to the user's Sigils and Elemental Affinity. Elements are perceived to be within the astrophysical body, while Sigils manifest Externally. Only Mages possess Astral Bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Body&lt;/strong&gt; - No matter how powerful a Mage may be, they are still biological creatures that need to eat, crap and sleep, subject to Eros and Thanatos, life and death. The Physicality of a Mage tends to reflect the degree of their Elemental affinity. Most infamously, Earthen Mages have rock-hard physiques, Air Mage are frail and flighty, while Lightning Mages have quickened metabolisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anima (Animus)&lt;/strong&gt; - Drawn from the theory of the Meister Sigmund Jung, the psyche, the Anima (male psyche &amp;amp; common vernacular) and Animus (female psyche) inference a being's subconscious self-awareness. Only sapient creatures are classified as capable of possessing Anima and Animus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mana&lt;/strong&gt; - The Gurus of Hinduism refer to this as spiritual energy or Prana. Chinese Doshi denotes this spiritual energy as Qi. Early Western Theology referred to this energy as Faith or Zeal. Modern Spellcraft unified the term as Mana, a generic word for mystical 'energies' of any kind. The Astral Body produces mana as it interacts with Glyphs and Gates, channelling mana into conduits of the physical body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mana Pool&lt;/strong&gt; - The maximum amount of mana which a Mage can produce. When the Astral Body is no longer capable of producing mana, this is referred to as OOM, or Out of Mana. VMI - Volumetric Mana Index - is the official nomenclature for measuring a Mage's mana pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mana Channel -&lt;/strong&gt; Often confused with the concept of a Mana Conduit. A Mana channel refers to metaphysical pathways by which Mana produced by the Astral Body enters the Mage's physical body. A Mage's Mana Channels can never be damaged without injury to their Astral body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate and Conduit&lt;/strong&gt; - A Gate refers to nomenclature describing the effect of non-elementally attuned mana becoming suffused with the Mage's Element. This 'elementally-attuned' mana then feeds back into the physical body. The pathways through the Mage's physical body are referred to as Mana Conduits. Damage to the physical body damages one's Mana Conduits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essence -&lt;/strong&gt; A metaphysical form of energy derived from a being's existence. Referred to commonly as one's 'Soul' or "Spirit" in ancient Spellcraft, contemporary Spellcraft sees Essence as a hitherto little-known form of energy, separate from mana. Creatures possessing great magical power and ego possess higher degrees of Essence. Likewise, sapient beings typically possess greater essence than their non-sapient peers of the same subtype. NoMs, in general, possess little Essence. Human and Demi-human Mages possess immense Essence, a fact profoundly valuable to the study of Necromancy. Theoretical Spellcraft propose that Essence is tied to a Mage's ability to access particular Schools of Magic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School of Magic&lt;/strong&gt; (Imperial Metric Schools) - Since unifying the study of Magic under the IMPERIAL METRIC system during the Spellcraft Revolution at the turn of the 20th century, 7 Schools of Magic exist: Evocation, Transmutation, Conjuration, Abjuration, Divination, Enchantment and Illusion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid School of Magic&lt;/strong&gt; - Rarely, some Mages awaken with Magic in between the Sanctioned Schools of Magic, belonging to no School. Of these types of Magic, Biomancy: the manipulation of Postive Energy and Necromancy: the manipulation of Negative Energy, reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awakening&lt;/strong&gt; - The term is loosely used to describe an Acolyte coming to terms with their first School of Magic and their Affinity for an Element. In Frontier cities, NoM Civilians are filtered, with potential Mages tested for aptitude. In tier 1 cities, Mages naturally grow into their powers, training from an early age. A 'Stimuli Crystal' may be used to induce an Awakening, circulating mana into the recipient as to 'jolt' their Astral Bodies into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spellcraft&lt;/strong&gt; - The study of Magic. The Imperial Metric System (IMS) splits spells into 9 Tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Spellcraft Theorems&lt;/strong&gt; - Spells whose theory and manifestation fall outside of existing methodology. Most universities study Advanced Spellcraft to push past the current boundaries of human knowledge of Magic. Those who contribute significantly to this study are awarded the title of Meister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctioned and Unsanctioned Magic&lt;/strong&gt; - Sanctioned Magic may be purchased by Tower Mages with LDMs, HDMs, and CCs. Unsanctioned Magic may only be acquired through petition. If a Mage is found practising unlicenced Unsanctioned Magic, they are subject to severe punishments and even disbarment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigil&lt;/strong&gt; - A spiritual manifestation of one's affinity for particular forms of Magic, tied to the generation of one's Astral Body during Awakening. Each school of Magic possesses a unique Sigil under the IMS visualisation doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glyph&lt;/strong&gt; - Sigils exist only in one's mind. When Mages wish to manifest the concept of Sigils externally, they turn to Glyphs. Glyphs vary but may be thought of as symbols of power capable of channelling Magical energy as though a man-made conduit existing outside the Mage's body. Magic Items and Enchantments such as Wards rely exclusively on complex Glyphs and Mandalas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandala&lt;/strong&gt; - Taken from Tibetian Mysticism, Mandala refers to large-scale, complex Glyph arrays used to support complex Spellcraft manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spell&lt;/strong&gt; - A series of Incantations both somatic and verbal which triggers magical phenomena when exercised with mana from a Mage's Astral Body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rite&lt;/strong&gt; - A spell requiring time, preparation, and setup, typically includes meditation, ritual and complex external components. Rites include city-wide Strategic-Class Spells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incantation&lt;/strong&gt; - Invocations with somatic and verbal components. These are mnemonics which manifest Magic through Sigils. The higher the 'tier' of magic, the more complex and convoluted the number of Major and Minor Incantations. Senior and experienced Mages may specialise in particular spells so that they become 'silent'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shield&lt;/strong&gt; (Mage) - Shield refers to the mental ability for Mages to form a barrier of mana around their physical bodies. Even without training, a Mage is capable of manifesting a membrane of mana, projected just outside of their physical body, which displaces hostile mana and foreign objects. Abjuration specialises in forming persistent Shields and Shields that can manifest on Mages OTHER than the caster. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acolyte&lt;/strong&gt; - Neophytes and Acolytes are the colloquial names for beginner Mages. The moniker of Mage or Senior Mage is given to those with mastery over at least one school of magic, meaning access to spells over tier 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magus&lt;/strong&gt; - A Magus is an arcanist who has gained multiple Schools of Magic through talent or laborious study. To be called a Magus in public, the Mage must undergo examination within a Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magister&lt;/strong&gt; - Likewise, a Magister is a peer-reviewed, publically sanctioned Magic Caster. Unlike the moniker of Magus, Magister is a title that comes with the weight of public service and responsibility of upholding the Tower's interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meister&lt;/strong&gt; - A Meister is a Magister, but not all Magister can become a Meister. A Meister is a Mage who has contributed significant advancement to Spellcraft, and whose work benefits all of Mankind. Claude Van Saint, the famous healer who pioneered modern magical medicine, is a Meister. Philo R. Farnsworth, the man responsible for proving that Illusions may exist as a form of media stored in Capture Crystals, is a Meister. As powerful as famous individuals like Henry Kilroy has been, his preference for keeping his studies wrapt and secret excludes him from the title of Meister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magi&lt;/strong&gt; - A Mage whose power and command over Spellcraft exceed Sanctioned limits, going beyond the 9 Tiers. A Magi rarely concerns themselves with worldly affairs. They are seen as humanity's greatest deterrence against Demi-human and Magical Creature incursions. It is unfortunate that Magi are typically old and venerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctioned Mage&lt;/strong&gt; - A Mage registered under a Tower, beholden to its Laws, Codes of Conduct, and Ethics for Public Practice of Spellcraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogue Mage&lt;/strong&gt; - A Free-Mage that is not registered, practices magic freely and therefore perceived as dangerous to society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier&lt;/strong&gt; (spell) - Tier 1 to 9 of Spellcraft. Tier 1 - 3 is accessible to almost all Mages. This tier is capable of combating individual, as well as groups of Monsters. Tier 4 - 6 exists within the realm of all Maguses as well as most Senior Mages with a single School of Magic. This tier is capable of wiping out Monster lairs and Demi-human villages. Tier 7 - 9 is open usually to Magisters for reason of both academic-access as well as state sanction. High tiers of Magic can act as strategic-class spells capable of wiping out cities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier&lt;/strong&gt; (Affinity) - The attunement of a Mage to their element. The higher the affinity, the higher the efficacy for Damage and Mana Cost. As Affinity grows, damage increases by a magnitude of 10% for every observable tier. Likewise, mana cost for spells decreases with higher affinity. Though damage increase appears to be on a linear scale, mana cost suffers from diminishing returns. As such, a spell will never be 'free'. &lt;br/&gt;Higher affinity likewise involves physiological and psychological changes for the Mage in question. Some examples are provided below, taken from the story-in-progress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire&lt;/strong&gt; Mages are often hot-tempered and over-zealous, possessing a short fuse. Physiologically, they gain resistance to cold and heat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air&lt;/strong&gt; Mages become fragile and whispy, becoming airy and flighty in their mannerisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earthern&lt;/strong&gt; Mages undergo the most profound physiological change, becoming taller and more robust, with enhanced musculature, increasing both strength and fortitude. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water&lt;/strong&gt; Mages are known to be pliable and easily convinced, with personalities that like water, are capable of fitting any vessel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lightning&lt;/strong&gt; Mages gain increased metabolism, becoming prideful and possessive beings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash&lt;/strong&gt; Mages are known to become apathetic. Their emotions become dulled by the continued practice of Ash Magic until they waste away. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Void&lt;/strong&gt; Mages are rumoured to exhibit extreme hunger, both physiologically and in terms of their psychological demands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ooze&lt;/strong&gt; Mages are said to be slothful and lazy, unmotivated and uninspired. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mineral&lt;/strong&gt; Mages become dispassionate and pragmatic, often, their eyes take on the likeness of their attuned mineral element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Energy&lt;/strong&gt; Mages are ubiquitously known to be amiable, friendly and full of life and vigour, possessing a halo of likability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier&lt;/strong&gt; (Creature) - A generic classification system used in common parlance to ratify the danger-level of a particular creature. Goblins usually have a tier of 1. A raid of Goblins may be up to 4 or 5. An adult Dragon up to 20, pending bloodlines. A Leviathan with a swarm of Mermen may be up to 25 - 30, requiring the mobilisation of a Tower or Towers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class&lt;/strong&gt; (Monster) - Military lexicon for the number of Mages needed to pacify a threat. Soldier-Class infer a single Mage. Lieutenant-Class infers the need for a Magus or two or more Mages. General Class requires a Magister. Usually, a party of Mage may subdue a Lieutenant-Class Magical Creature. A Party of Senior Mages lead by a Magus may defeat a General-Class Creature. Some creatures, such as Titans (overlarge Monsters) and Mythics (Land Gods) are likewise a part of this denomination. Class systems differ from nation to nation and are not an official Tower designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wildlands&lt;/strong&gt; - Lands not occupied by Human Cities, separated into Zones. Green - relatively safe for NoM habitation. Orange - unsafe for occupancy, safe for Mages to traverse. Purple - dangerous for both Mages and NoMs, contains hostile creatures that will disrupt human habitation. Black - extremely dangerous for human habitation; zone includes creatures that predate on humans. Environmental factors may also play into codified Zoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demi-Humans&lt;/strong&gt; - Humanoid races that share the Prime Material Plane with Humans. Friendly species include Nordic and Bavarian Dwarves, Keltic Elves, German Gnomes and Hobbits from New Zealand. Hostile races include Goblinoids, Dragonoids, Harpies, Serpentfolk, Merfolk, Mermen (Oceanic), Lizardmen, Dryads, and other sapient beings capable of speech. Like most Magical Creatures, these beings possess a Core. Some Demi-humans are capable of interbreeding with humans. The majority of Human cities are highly xenophobic and racially homogeneous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magical Creatures&lt;/strong&gt; - Creatures generated by nature where the veil between the Prime Material and the Elemental Planes are weak. Current theory infers they are Elemental creatures that manifest into the Prime Material. Magical Creatures possess Cores, which are condensed mana that serve as the anchor of the creature's Essence to the Prime Material, giving it life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cores&lt;/strong&gt; (Creature) - From the lowest Snotling to the highest Ancient Dragon, all Magical Creatures possess Cores. Upon death, the Core shatters, releasing the wild energies contained within. Interesting fact - ancient creatures have highly condensed and compact Cores that are virtually impervious to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; (s) - When a creature possesses a high level of anima, its Core may contain a Spirit. Spirits are potentially found in all forms of Creature Cores, though typically, it is exceedingly rare amongst lower order Magical Creatures. For Spirit-Seekers, the irony lies in that billions of low-tier creatures exist with a lottery's chance of possessing a Spirit. While beings with a high probability of retaining a Core upon death, as well as possessing both ego and anima, are exceedingly rare, and more often than not incredibly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; (Mage) - A Mage dreams of augmenting their elemental powers with a Spirit. A Spirit may be acquired through directly killing and harvesting Cores, then bending the will of the 'anima' of the creature contained therein to the Mage's service. When successfully attuned, the Spirit is absorbed into the Mage's Astral Body, becoming a part of the Mage's ability to channel Elemental powers. The alternate method of gaining a Spirit is through taming existing Magical Creatures and opening one's Astral Body to the foreign Spirit. This methodology is considered highly irregular and potentially fatal for an unsuspecting Mage incapable of melding with the entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiars&lt;/strong&gt; - Typically, the Conjure Familiar spell is responsible for bonding Elemental entities to a Mage's psyche or anima. Such creatures are manifested from the psyche of the caster. When a Spirit is partnered with the Mage, the Anima of the Spirit usually takes the form of the Familiar. When a Spirit is bonded with a Mage already in possession of a Familiar, it usually subsumes the form of the Familiar and replaces it with its own. It is not known if Familiars can become Spirits through gaining ego and animus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Frontier&lt;/strong&gt; - Originally a term denoting cities which are cut off from logistical support after WWII, the term has grown to encompass all Human territories lacking geodynamic Ley-lines. Some Frontier cities such as Merauke, Darwin, Chittagong, and Izmir, are little more than Human havens eking out a living in the wilderness, serving as little more than trading ports and supply stations. Prosperous Frontier cities such as Sydney, Singapore, Naples, Las Vegas, have a quality of life nearing tier 1 cities in all but name, lacking the geography, natural resource and political power to ascend into the status of a tier 1 city. With exceptions akin to continental hub-cities like Singapore and Istanbul, the vast majority of Frontier cities have limited access to Spellcraft and Magitech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier 1 Cities&lt;/strong&gt; - Cities build around powerful convergences of Ley-lines are considered tier 1 cities. These cities have the near-perpetual energy to supply to their internal and external Shielding Stations. To apply for tier 1 status, a city-state must pass muster with the Commonwealth Towers , joining the network of tier 1 cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shielding Station&lt;/strong&gt; - A stationary mini-Tower built to withstand the elements, manned by Abjurers and a patrolling team of Mages. At the heart of the Shielding Station is a Resonance Crystal which projects a frequency harmful to all beings possessing Cores not attuned to a Mage. A Shield Generator Tower creates the resonance, visually manifesting as a shimmering 'wall' or 'barrier', and additional, smaller station refract the "Shielding".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISTC Station&lt;/strong&gt; - The Inter-State Teleportation Circle Station allow Mages long-range teleportation to and from nations. Prohibitively expensive, ISTC Stations are used only by the upper echelon of Tower Mages and State-level operatives. Most tier 1 cities have ISTC stations to and from the Towers in allied cities, as well as its satellite, Frontier cities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tower&lt;/strong&gt; - A robust structure with inbuilt Enchantments. A Tower can vary in size, function and power. In most cities, the Tower functions as a way-station, a bastion, and a nerve-centre for all magical matter. Even the most basic Tower include the ability to amplify the manifestation of Spellcraft of its stationed Mages, the levitation of its structural body, long-distance teleportation and displacement, and the ability to act as a mass-communication Divination array. A tier 1 city's Ley-lines usually provide power to the Tower. For Frontier cities with limited geodynamic supplies of mana, a significant cargo of HDMs are required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Towers&lt;/strong&gt; - The United Nation Council of Towers (U.N) refers to a coalition of all Towers from around the world formed after World War II's Beast Tide. Akin to the U.N in Gwen's old world, the Towers sanctify and ratify the regulation of Spellcraft, the status of city-states, and mediate the conflicts of interest between Human nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tower&lt;/strong&gt; (Commonwealth) - Towers belonging to the old British Mageocracy, said to have conquered more than 50% of all Human lands in its Golden Age. The Commonwealth form a loose factional coalition through a shared ideology of social democracy, English as a primary language, and mutual defence-pacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tower&lt;/strong&gt; (Independent) - Towers not beholden to any specific faction and are wholly independent (on paper). Singapore, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, and Hong Kong are examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tower&lt;/strong&gt; (State Owned) - Towers which are a part of the global network of Towers but are beholden to their city-states or nations. Almost all non-independent Towers belong to this category. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NoMs&lt;/strong&gt; - Non-Magical Human Beings, also derivatively known as No-Magic. In the Frontier and tier 1 cities, NoMs serves as a labour force. The majority of NoMs work in agriculture and manufacturing, with a small percentile working in Administration and other white-collar positions. Most NoMs, whether because of indoctrination or the social climate, see the possibility of becoming a Mage, or introducing a Mage to their bloodline to be a way out of a life of oppression, poverty and mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House&lt;/strong&gt; (Mage) - A bloodline of Mages usually with a powerful or influential Progenitor. A House usually includes three or more generations of Mages. A Branch House is when a potential heir, usually a sibling, starts a new House with the same bloodline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clan&lt;/strong&gt; (Mage) - A coalition of Houses sharing the same bloodline. A Clan involves several hundred individuals across a dozen Branch Houses, supporting the Main House. Clans are highly hierarchical. Clans are also unique, pending context and culture. Asian Clans focus on styles or Schools of Magic, while European Clans may focus on bloodline lineage. Some Clans operate by region, heedless of bloodline or magic. Due to the desire to keep a particular bloodline 'pure' or a specific magical talent prevalent, marriage within the Clan is common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sect&lt;/strong&gt; (Mage) - Sects can be religious, ideological, factional, or based upon styles of Magic. In China, old Doushi Clans evolved into Sects, with famous examples such as Kunlun, Huashan, Shaolin, Wutang, The White Lotus Society and so on. The Western world's Sects tend to be based around organised religion, while regions in continental Africa tend to have Sects based around tribal boundaries and shared ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currency&lt;/strong&gt; - The objective means by which trade is conducted. Humans use localised currency, LDMs, and HDMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mana Crystals&lt;/strong&gt; (LDMs and HDMs) - Mana Crystal is the currency used by Mages across the human cities. In its raw form, they are harvested from places where the fabric between the Prime Material Plane and the Elemental Planes are thin, allowing 'crystalised' shards of mana to grow. Where there are large volumes of Mana Crystals, there are almost always powerful Magical Beasts. While most mana crystals are non-elementally aligned, rare and precious specimens do exist as gems and precious stones. Examples include Jadeite, Citrine, Emerald, Zircon and Turquoise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crystal Currency&lt;/strong&gt; - Defined by the World Bank as a single shard of High or Low-density crystal, containing a standardised (1 LDM or 1 HDM) volume of mana. A shard of LDM resembles a fingerling crystal akin to a 3cm hexagonal pencil. The appearance of LDM currency is exemplified by its semi-opaque state. Comparatively, a shard of HDM is transparent and without blemish, measuring 5 CM. Certification is overseen by a cooperation between the Towers and a local agency (Bank of China, for example). The volume of crystals in circulation is often controlled on the Frontier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDMs&lt;/strong&gt; - Low-Density Mana Crystals are commonly used on the Frontier and as lesser denominations. Raw shards of L-D crystal can be exchanged in terms of weight and total mana volume, but cannot be used as formal currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDMs&lt;/strong&gt; - High-Density Mana Crystals are the currency of choice for Mages in the tier 1 cities, consisting of compressed and certified crystals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currency Cards&lt;/strong&gt; - Certified cards which contain 10 - 50 - 100 - 1000 HDMs that can be exchanged at local banking branches and Towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NoM Currency&lt;/strong&gt; - Local currency issued by the government for use by the NoM population. In poorer Frontiers and tier 1 cities with large volumes of NoM activity, the local currency is vulnerable to hyperinflation, forgery, and currency fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demi-humans and Human Currency&lt;/strong&gt; - As humans are the only race capable of mass-producing crystal currency, Demi-humans have taken to use human currency as the preferred unit of exchange for barter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrolls&lt;/strong&gt; - Scrolls are a way for mages to save their spells for later use and also to use spells they cant cast themselves. However, with the increasing difficulty of a spell, the cost of the materials of the scroll rises exponentially. It always takes an Enchanter to create one. A book of spells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grimoire&lt;/strong&gt; - A book of spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mage Classifications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CQB Mage - &lt;/strong&gt;A Close Quarters Battle Mage as the name says is a mage focused on melee or low range combat. A Transmuter, the popular military spec is near peerless at lower tiers, growing to encompass the peak of power in the middle tiers. Against Mythics, however, the CQB Mage suffers from a problem of scale. Nonetheless, no dungeon crawl is complete without a CQB Mage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War Mage&lt;/strong&gt; - War Mage is a classification of the Towers given to a Mage depending on how much damage a sorcerer can reliably cause given the opportunity. Though technically all Combat Mages are suited for war, very few individuals can sustain enough output to be classified as a danger by themselves. Though the metric is not definitive, a Class I War Mage may wipe out a Hamlet or Village without overtaxing themselves. A Class IV War Mage may cause significant loss of life and infrastructure if left unchecked. A Class VI War Mage may be able to depopulate a city of 100,000 or more alone. If a Mage is capable of such abilities without significant resource allocations, they are considered a public risk, and will almost always be tracked and monitored through their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artillery Mage&lt;/strong&gt; - A Mage serving as mobile artillery casting large scale AoE spells. A team usually supports them, providing protection and recovery. Multiple artillery mages with support team can rival the firepower of a Tower in short bursts. In times of War, boxed squadrons of Artillery Mages are seen follow the spearhead of an assault, laying waste to all that bar their way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translocator&lt;/strong&gt; - A Transportation Conjurer specialises in the translocation of personnel and goods. A large mana pool, knowledge in Enchantment and Mandala-crafting is essential for this class of specialists. Heedless of elements, these Mages are common to every mid to significant military engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleric / Healer / Combat Healer&lt;/strong&gt; - The title of Cleric is an archaic one, often used in conjunction with that of the "healer". In modern Spellcraft, there is little difference, as both are seen by the public as angels in white, delivering salvation of magical restoration where ever they venture. In reality, a Cleric is a healer trained in the use of Faith magic. Faith, being a commodity unique to Humanity and its distinct history of arcanistry, has been long-since associated with healing, restoration, and resurrection. In ages past, without Spellcraft, it was only through pure Faith and invocations passed down from generation to generation by especial individuals born with talent and genius that healing magic existed. Today, any Mage capable of channelling Positive Energy will be trained as a healer. A Combat Healer refers to experienced healers who concurrently possess some ability to protect themselves. In peace times, healers work in the Great Hospitals. In times of war, all healers are Combat Healers. There exist as a particular denomination for Clerics specialising in combat-healing in the mid of spellfire— Combat Clerics. These Relic-carrying faith healers, guarded by their retinue of Knights as they lay down the mass-benedictions of Faith, may very well change the tide of a losing battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mage Flight&lt;/strong&gt; - a party of five Mages, usually with balaned roles, equipped with means of Flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em; color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"&gt;Nations and Factions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Britannic Mageocracy (British Commonwealth) - &lt;/strong&gt;A Behemoth that starves to death is still the size of a mountain. Though the days of Pax Britannia are long gone, the shadow of Victoria's "Soverenity where the sun never sets," continues to leave its mark on the world. Once the apex Human organisation on Earth, the Mageocracy has had a long way to fall. First came the Undead and the Great War, forcing the Mageocracy to commit resources away from the colonies. This imbalance resulted in the Pan-European Conflict, spearheaded by resurgent competitors mad for the unclaimed Frontiers around the globe. After the 70s Beast Tide, the Mageocracy rebranded itself as the Commonwealth, emphasising cooperation between the far green isle in the north and its vassal Frontiers, from Australia to Singapore to South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States of America&lt;/strong&gt; - The US weathered the necromantic disaster and the pan-European conflict in the early 20th century quite well, managing to profit significantly from the diaspora of Mages leaving Europe for the New World after each world war. Despite its turbulent history of genocide and slavery against the native Demi-humans of North America, the nation prides itself on individual freedom, democracy, and the single most extensive cache of domestic Magitech armaments outside of Deepholm. After the Beast Tide, the USA lost large swaths of Frontiers, most notably the Great Plains and the Rocky mountains to resurgent Demi-humans, thus confining human settlements to the east and west coastal regions and the Great Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Powers (European Union) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- ETA &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU is a tightly-knit league of European Nations that survived the Beast Tide of '71 through mutual defence-pacts. Together with France, Italy, Russia and over thirty other member states and city-states, the Central Powers rivals the Mageocracy, China, and the USA as the world's premier Human Superpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany - Germany has remained one of the leading powers in the world, channelling a large part of its influence through the EU. &lt;br/&gt;France - &lt;br/&gt;Greece is famed for the Oracle of Delphi, who has aided Humanity in mitigating many of its worst disasters. In antiquity, Greece was once the centre of Europe, bridging continents. &lt;br/&gt;Spain - &lt;br/&gt;Russia - &lt;br/&gt;Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands - &lt;br/&gt;Poland - &lt;br/&gt;Italy -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vatican - &lt;/strong&gt;A Church-State led by Pope Benedict XV centred on Rome. It derives enormous influence indirectly through its institution as well as directly through martial and healing Orders sworn to the Catholic religion. Of all the Judeo-Christian Religion to survive the annuals of time, the Vatican commands the vastest body of believers among Humanity, which they call Christiandom. In aeons past, the Vatican had called up Holy Wars, called Crusades against the Undead of Eastern Europe, or the Elemental Sultanates of the Middle East. Today, the Vatican remains the spiritual centre of Humanity and has not participated in politics since the Spellcraft revolution of the 19th and 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia&lt;/strong&gt; - For a country where everything is trying to kill you, Australia is by equal degrees the lucky country. As a colony isolated from almost all geopolitical conflicts, the country has weathered the various global disputes, happy to contend with its internal crisis of Mermen, Saurians, Were-roos, Dropbears, Weredropbears. Aracanids, Dingos, Were-bats, Snake-kin, regular roos, Were-mus, regular emus, Gobs, Hobs, Yobbos, Trololos and so on. Australia, perhaps thanks to Henry Kilroy, surprisingly has five Towers, though only Sydney and Melbourne may be counted as equals among their European cousins. The current Master of Sydney is none other than Gunther von Shultz, arguably the most formidable Spellslinger in the southern hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China - &lt;/strong&gt;The "Middle Country" of the Orient lost much of its power in the 19th and early 20th century. However, it is slowly clawing its way back towards the world stage. It had the unfortunate luck of fighting an Undead incursion from Pyongyang in the North-east when the Beast Tide struck. Late to embrace Spellcraft and its revolutionary impact on Humanity, China's long history has gifted it with a unique magical heritage. Presently, the Chines Communists are contending with Undead from the northern Korean peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt; - Dai Nippon, like Germany, was a mid-40s industrial superpower afflicted by the resource-wars. Taking advantage of China's rapid decline at the turn of the century, Japan took both Manchuria and Korea in the 1910s, then pushed into the Chinese heartland in the 1940s as an ally of the Reich. Ultimately, the ambition of its rapid expansion placed it on the warpath with the USA. After Germany's surrender, Japan continued to plunder China and Korea until the Americans executed the first Super Massive Strategic Magic on Hiroshima. Post War, Japan quickly embraced Spellcraft manufacturing in both Heavy Industry and consumer Magi-tech. Currently, Japan is divided between its old capital— Kyoto, favouring Demi-human co-existence, juxtaposing the Magi-tech capital, Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Korea&lt;/strong&gt; - Korea refers to South Korea, marked by the purification zone stretching from Kaesŏng to Kosong, as North Korea has completely fallen under the sway of the Cult of Juche. Post Sino and then the Communist split, South Korea, with the help of the USA, has rebranded itself as a primary designer and manufacturer of Magi-tech. Though the country modelled itself after the USA, feudal rule by the Chaebol, the Ten Great Corporations, each ruled by a patriarch, hold absolute sway. Its citizens bitterly jest that in America, the top entrepreneurs can change anytime; in Seoul, the Gods are immovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aztecs - &lt;/strong&gt;The Aztecs native nation in Meso-America is in a state of continual conflict with the US. For centuries since the arrival of the colonists to the New World, Central America has been plundered, first by the British then by the new nation that rose from slaying the British. Until the Beast Tide, the Aztecan Theocracy at Tenochtitlan had been hardpressed by superior American spell power. Now, after three decades, the Theocracy and its host of Spirit-Shifters will no longer be subordinate to any authority other than their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Incas - &lt;/strong&gt;The Inca nation managed to reassert itself in the early 20th century, casting off the Spanish colonial government in the Andes. They are in a somewhat critical position, bordering the Amazonian Black Zone. A theocracy built around the Sun Cult and its King, Inti, they also one of the most isolated major human settlement in the world. Today, the nation has developed its first Mage Tower thanks to the Mageocracy and is looking to participate in global trade and politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ideological Factions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factions can be broadly categorised by "The Greys", "The Middle Path" and "The Militants" Those three cover most of the ideological spectrum Mages follow across official geopolitical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Militant Faction - &lt;/strong&gt;The Militant Faction is composed of Mages that believe that it is the right of Humanity to dominate Earth. They are Mages whose origins often stem from families, Houses, and Clans that rose to the top during the hey-days of Spellcraft. To the far right, members support the extermination of all Demi-Human races by way of Purges; to the left, members wish for Humanity to rule over any useful non-human beings. Though the Militant Faction is the weakest among the top tiers of the magical community, it enjoys immense support among the lower-tiers, and the among the NoMs, who see nationalistic, race-based endeavours as a way out of poverty and suffering. They also have known links to the Vatican, though the depth of that relationship is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Grey Faction &lt;/strong&gt;- The Grey Faction believes that Humanity is only one more race on Earth and that while they should strive for its betterment, it should not attempt to deprive the other sentient races of resources to do so. Practically speaking, the Grey Faction serves diplomats who tie commercial links of variable degrees of savouriness with the Demi-Humans factions. To the right, the extremist Greys believe that without the NoMs, Humanity could abandon the cities and reproduce among the Wildlands as a quasi-magical race. To the left, the socialists conceive of an intermingling of human and demi-human bloodlines, resulting in the blurring of racial and magical segregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Middle Path&lt;/strong&gt; - The Middle Path Faction is, as its name indicate, not focused on an ideal like the Greys or the Militant. If they have an objective, it would be to balance and arbitrate the other's excesses, assisting the Militant when a Purge is necessary to safeguard a settlement and bankrolling a Grey initiative to guarantee a stable relationship with Demi-human colonies. If anything, the Middle Path can be identified by their labyrinthine network of favours, acquaintance, enmity and friendship it has woven since its funding, promoted in part by its founder, Henry Kilroy. Though the Middle Path prides itself on being the most powerful of factions, it is wildly fragmented in its power base, with a decentralised system of politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 2em; color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"&gt;Demi-Human Races&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dwarves&lt;/strong&gt; - The Dwarves have their original hearth in the metropolis of Deepholm, said to be located in between the Prime Material and a deposit-rich region of the Elemental Plane of Earth. The Deep is the natural home region of the Dwarves, who have been digging 'upward' to locate resources away from the highly competitive domain within the Elemental Plane itself. These colonies in the Murk are the Citadels, the equivalent of human Frontiers. After the Beast Tide separated Deepholm from the Murk, the stranded Dwarven Thanes in their respective domains attempted, with futility to reach a network of low-ways connecting the Dwarven cities of old called the 'Dyar Morkk'. Some communities, seeing the futility of such a quest, has chosen co-existence with Humans, others chose isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TBA: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hvítálfar&lt;/strong&gt; - White Elves, the Highborn Elves - the near-immortals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dökkálfar&lt;/strong&gt; - An elvish term for Dwarves (Elves of Below) Humans generally do not use this term. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ljósálfar&lt;/strong&gt; - Light Elves (Beings of Light) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Svartálfar&lt;/strong&gt; - Dark Elves (Beings of Dark) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Träälvor&lt;/strong&gt; - Wood Elves (Beings of the Woods)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elementals&lt;/strong&gt; - TBA in Collaboration with @Wandysama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saurians&lt;/strong&gt; - Saurians live where the Jungles are thick, hot, and muggy, such as in far north Queensland. Like the Greenskins, these primordial creatures have thrived in various forms and created vast civilisations away from Humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mermen&lt;/strong&gt; - The Empires of the Sea remain a thorn in the side of the Mageocracy and Humanity in general. Some scholars have even stated that in fact, Terra is not a domain for land dwellers, but rather an extension of the Elemental Plane of Water. Considering how much of the surface is covered by water, the argument is sound. For Humanity, the ocean is a place of tremendous resource, far more extensive than the land itself. The current theory for the Merman empires indicates that incursions are a form of Holy War, or that the undersea Factions are using Humanity to blunt its abundant population, a warier rationale is that an existential conflict for Earth herself fuels the Mermen Kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merfolk&lt;/strong&gt; - Different to Mermen, the 'folk' aspect infers land-dwelling Mermen, who live in rivers and lakes and estuaries. These are either outright hostile and exterminated, or live in a precarious peace with their human neighbours. Some have even attempted to integrate into civilised societies, though most remain at the stage of tribal governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenskins&lt;/strong&gt; - From Snots to Gobs to Hobs to Trolls to the Behemoths, the Greenskins are perhaps, the most prolific of all quasi-native elemental creatures. Pending on the region, they take on elemental subtypes, usually tied to one of the Prime-Elementals. When spikes of mana erupt, creating powerful mana flares near the Earth's surface, Gobs are always first on the scene, appearing en-mass to populate, then desolate the local flora and fauna. Deep in the Wildlands, whole civilisations of Greenskins exist that are millennia old. It is said that the Greenskin are long-time competitors to Dwarves, long before Humans entered the scene, and may even be collectively as old as Elves or Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="811" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/602439718218629130/703788351538462861/Screen_Shot_2020-04-26_at_12.03.14_pm.png" width="600"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">501870</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 06:00:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 349 - Dolls' House</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/500619</link><description>&lt;p&gt;"Gwen, come in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smiling member of the student-staff opened the oaken doors to Lady Grey's office at the Master's Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside, Gwen was surprised to find the Victorian room curtains billowing, flooding the solemn office with stark, wintery light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Head Mistress Loftus." Gwen bowed as soon as she entered. An arcane Quadro stood with Maxine, as for their identity, she could hazard a guess that they were her tutors. "Milords, Sirs and Madams…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two men and two women, and they instantly refocused their attention to catch Gwen in the crossfire of their imperious gazes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your instructors," the Lady affirmed Gwen's suspicions before turning to the austere group with a nod. "Magisters. Please introduce yourselves to our principal contributor in bringing England's Dwarves back into the fold. I am sure you are as eager to begin your moulding of our Void Mage as she is eager to learn your spells, so please— help yourselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first to tribute was a middle-aged gruff with a self-suffering demeanour. The man's hair, what was left of it, was slicked back and parted in the three-quarter style popular with military men. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Nils Kott." The Mage's speech carried a Germanic inflexion. "Abjuration, Warding and Enchantment specialist. I will be instructing you on the creation, maintenance and disruption of Spells and Mandalas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sir." Gwen delivered a heart-warming smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her instructor appeared unmoved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… Major Kott comes to us from Ludwig-Maximilians Universität. He is on loan in exchange for one of our own. Gwen, say hi to one of the top Abjurers of München," the Lady kindly bridged the awkward gap. "I asked for the Major because he has extensive combat experience. It wouldn't hurt to ask him about the Luftwaffe's much-lauded Undead Purges carried out in Romania. Major Kott led the spearhead operation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sir!" Gwen saluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Major dipped his chin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without pause, her next tutor, an enthused individual, younger than Kott, presented his very English self. Fair of skin and dark-haired, the sorcerer sported the atypical pale irises of a Mineral Mage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Magus Song, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Maxwell Brown, of the King's Browns, from Lynn. Though I do hold the title of Viscount, I sincerely hope that you and I could be on first name terms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen and the instructor shook hands. True to his disclosure, the Viscount's fingers were warm and clammy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I shall be your instructor in Adaptive Spellcraft theory. My speciality is meta-magic, and I currently teach Spell Theory over at Emmanuel's. With your Omni-talent and my knowledge, I hope there will be deeper profundities with which we can plumb. Once our new Meister— That is, Magister Wen from Fudan arrives, she will be joining us in expanding the hitherto untapped potentials of Void Magic. I will also be advising your cousin, Miss Kuznetsova, on her thesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Petra will be lucky to have you, sir. What manner of a caster are you, Magister Brown?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Myself?" Brown's grin grew broad. "I would fancy myself an Omni-Mage like yourself, Miss Song, although I was originally a Transmuter. My curiosity during my youth led me astray, I am afraid. I am no good in combat, though I hope with the aid of Magister Kott here, our endeavour may yet persevere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's my pleasure to be under your care, Sir."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The same! The same." The manic researcher withdrew with a face full of undisguised anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kareena Patil," the next instructor presented herself. This one had immediately attracted Gwen's attention. She was the only other Indian subcontinent magic caster Gwen had seen outside of Taj, and Gwen had met more than her fair share of Mages by now. With her creme latte complexion, the woman's age appeared repressed, revealed only by the subtle crow's feet around the edge of her olive eyes. "I'll be taking your Transmutation to the seventh tier, assuming your potential is genuine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Magister Brown had given a fiery introduction, then Magister Patil's was a cold one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dame Patil has been kind enough to divert from her duties at Lucy Cavendish," Lady Loftus intervened before the atmosphere grew colder. "There is scant a more accomplished sorceress in Cambridge when it comes to Spellshaping."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No need, Maxxie, to hide the girl's inexperience. I have seen your transcripts and your essays from Fudan, Miss Song. So much raw power without the understanding of the metaphysics that empower the phenomenon is a dangerous thing. Rarely have I felt such agony watching a sorceress trounce her way through an IICU." Kareena Patil remained aloof despite Lady Grey's kind intervention. "If you find my judgement too harsh, then prove me wrong in the months to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I won't disappoint, milady." Gwen bowed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would hope not." Patil shrugged. "It's not my CCs been burnt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am last then," spoke Gwen's final instructor, a woman in her forties with the bearing of someone from a period film. "My name is Keridwen Le Guevel, for the duration of your stay in Peterhouse and until my dismissal— I shall be your Illusionist, as well as your instructor of etiquette, speech, and decorum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen looked up at the Lady, who masked a smirk behind her flawless complexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Raw power," Keridwen stated abruptly. "Must come with dignity. I have heard of your peerless duelling exploits and have extensively studied your actions during the IIUC, Miss Song. Sufficient to say, if you wish to one day marry into the most august of Europe's families, you will need to perform considerably fairer than your prevailing circumstances have prescribed. My mission is to ensure that you look well, present well, and keep well so that your prospects remain undiminished."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the word "marry", Gwen's brow broke out in dismay. It was well, very well— that Elvia was not present to give her opinion on that matter. Thus far, other than the very confused Walkens of Brighton, she had not told anyone of that particular inclination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, ma'am." She relented for now. With Evee's present condition, her buyer's remorse was as acute as ever. She loved her healer as a Dwarf loved Mithril, but now there was a Dragon-sized chasm between the pair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Great! And finally, you have one more instructor— me." Lady Grey stepped out from behind her desk. "From now until you are capable of enrolling and keeping up with Cambridge's classes— I shall be your chief tutor. I will inspect your progress fortnightly, and we shall have guidance sessions per fortnight so that you may ask me questions discrete from your instructors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No discretion is needed!" Magister Brown appeared shocked. "Gwen, I will give you my all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's a Magister without a secret or two?" The Lady hand-waved the Viscount's concern. "Now, fair instructors, you may leave us. Gwen and I shall commence our first session. Peterhouse thanks you for your morning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her instructors shuffled out. &lt;br/&gt;Servants shuffled in, laid down tea, then were gone again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen sat in front of her patroness, shy as a lamb in her black and white pleated dress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An august lot," Lady Loftus began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am in your debt, milady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Loftus motioned for tea, and to Gwen's amazement, the tea set obliged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think nothing of it. The most important thing about learning Spellcraft isn't having access to the best spell instructors, spellbooks or tutors. Rather, one is required to know the right questions to ask. To that end, let's begin with the fundamentals so you won't embarrass yourself later. Amuse me, War Mage, what Frontier nonsense have they taught you about the Imperial Spellcraft System?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IMS began as an internationally ratified methodology for practising arcanistry first pioneered by Jean-Philipe de Périgord at Saint-Cloud," Gwen's recall was as expert as the vagueness of her historical understanding. "Later, Meister Wolfgang Maximilian of Berlin expanded the system during the unification. The Mageocracy was a late fosterer that vastly expanded Spellcraft during the hey-days of Pax Britannica, peaking just before the Great War. The controversy is that we appropriated the system from the central powers despite refusing to participate in its inception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that's an amusing bit of history." Lady Grey drew in the scent from her Earl Grey, a tea named after one of her ancestors. "The accuracy is wanting, I fear. Tell me, child, as a guest of the Red Keep, what have the Dwarves told you? I know the Deepdowners mention this fact at every turn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hanmoul said Humans stole the structure for the IMS from the Seven Ancestors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not wrong." Lady Grey's lips curled with amusement. "Though theft is such a strong word. One may as well steal the concept of colour! Magic, sorcery, arcanistry— SPELLCRAFT— Gwen, is the observance of that which governs the hidden laws of nature— the rules that bind together this fabric we call the Prime Material Plane. Anyone sufficiently observant enough, or possessed of an earnest desire for discovery like Magister Brown, is going to uncover its rules sooner or later. So no, I would not venture to say who stole from who. The foundation was volunteered, at any rate—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Elves? Ma'am?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. Now there's something you don't read in your Frontier manuals. Gwen, you've been studying Spellcraft, in a manner, but you've never tapped into its source. Take my Earl Grey, for example, you've drunk it all your life— but have you seen Wildland Keemun? Have you ever touched the flesh of the bergamot that gives this tea its unique scent? Did you know a change in the rainfall changes the flavour? Or drying out the soil fortifies the scent?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And so it goes with Spellcraft. In time, as you grow into a finer sorceress than you are now, you will inevitably meet our benefactors who centuries ago sowed the seeds, I suppose, to see what will grow. Mind you, I am speaking only of the IMS. Long before the Hvítálfar gifted their unique, esoteric understanding, magic was studied in enclosed Enclaves and hidden Cabals, consisting of Wizard Circles, Witch Covens and Warlock Conspiracies. And of course, we mustn't forget the Vatican— though that's another sarcophagus altogether."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Hvítálfar?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indeed. It is what the High-born call themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ma'am." Gwen could barely contain the excitement in her voice. "Are you saying Elves taught us sorcery?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No," Lady Grey bid Gwen curb her enthusiasm. "And nor is it 'Elves'. Our allies are a fringe group of forward-thinking radicals, and what they engendered was the beginnings of something no Demihuman could conceive, the 'rise' of Humanity. Can you imagine, Gwen, that though there are now billions of humans dwelling upon the Prime Material Plane, we were once the runt of Terra's litter? The most impoverished of the sapient races?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is Spellcraft Elven?" Gwen did her best to digest the Lady's words, but her focus remained steadfast locked onto Elven matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see Henry's education has heavily favoured pragmatism," Lady Grey patiently commented. "Practice without context, how flavourless that must be, dear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't mind it." Gwen stopped to retrieve a sweet biscuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just as well then. I doubt your other tutors would be as inclined as I am. They're used to older, more knowledgable pupils. Anyhow, to continue, let us begin with antiquity. No, Spellcraft isn't Elven. Humans always possessed their own magic. From the ancient rule of the First Dynasty to the Israelites' uprising against Ramses II, rare individuals in history have appeared with "Talent". Have you not heard of the Greek heroes of antiquity? Hercules? Hector, Perseus, the wily Illusionist Odysseus? The indomitable Transmuter Achilles? Doesn't it make your blood boil, child, to think that despite our not so distant history, explosions of raw Human talent had germinated empires stretching far beyond our means? Ancient magic, Faith magic, and... Necromancy... evolved entirely on its own, surprising even the Hvítálfar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Elves…" Gwen reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, yes." Lady Grey smiled. "As for Elven intervention, there exists no lack of circumstantial evidence. That said, the Hvítálfar's schemes are beyond human history, if simply because the original contractees, their children, and their scions, had less life in them than the lowest Träälvor. Where the Hvítálfars have interfered in history, we have only ruins to tell the tale. For instance, Sumeria's rise to power hinted heavily at the involvement of the Fair Folk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sumeria... Gilgamesh? I thought that part of the world consists of nought but Elementals and Black Zones?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indeed." Lady Loftus took a sip to wet her lips. "Present-day academics believe the Mesopotamian intervention by the Hvítálfar may have to do with the growing potency of the Eleventh Dynasty and the rise of the Canaanites, who by now had developed a potent form of Faith-craft. Do you know of Enkidu?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The man-bull."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right. Gilgamesh's constant companion, was a being 'created by the Gods' to interfere with the urban King Gilgamesh's conquest. From what we know of the noble Elementals residing in the Babylonian basin, Enkidu was likely a simulacrum of sorts— a Flesh Golem created by the Archon of the Elementals, Ishtar, keeper of the Sacred Plains. According to the surviving manuscripts, the Golem was peerless in combat and all but resistant to magic. If so, how could a fledgeling King defeat such a being created from the raw magic of creation?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's brain bloated from the flood of information. Elementals, deserts, ancient history, Faith Magic, Spellcraft— But then again, wasn't that the nature of history? The chronicle of Humanity was by nature an interwoven web of causation, tottering from one tragedy to the next, with kingdoms rising and falling like sandcastles at high tide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From the Epic of Gilgamesh, the poets speak of a companion of the King— a 'temple maiden' called Shamhat. She left his side, alone, mind you, to tame the Golem with her demi-divine body. In the desert, she made love to the creature for seven days and seven nights, until the Enkidu's angst abated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… how lewd."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Poetic epics, much like our popular vid-cast, frequently whets its audience with high appeals to low appetites." The Lady laughed, pointing to Gwen's exposed ankles. "Have you seen your IIUC broadcasts? I am afraid not even the highest institutions of learning is above titillating the audience for ratings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen hid her cringe with another biscuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyway," the Lady continued. "Enkidu has no gender. It's a golem. It has no genitals. Elementals do not reproduce as we do. It is neither male nor female. How does one make love to that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… the Epic's composers must have had an incredible imagination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Haha… indeed. Of course, now we have confirmation that Shamhat was a Ljósálfar, an acolyte overseeing the Sumerian Sects. Our Hvítálfar herders wanted to see if our tenacious selves, capable of populating the harshest of habitats, could be a war potential against Ishtar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were the Elves' spell fodder?" Gwen stated incredulously. "But…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And therein lies the Hvítálfars' dilemma. Humans, up to a certain point, whether now or in history, are easily steered, at least at first. Unlike the other races, say the Dwarves, with their ageless tradecraft, or the Green-skins, with their versatile mutability, or the Mermen, unparalleled in their propagation, what Humans excel in— is &lt;em&gt;chaos."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chaos?" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Raw, unmitigated, chaos— which we shall call innovation, invention and experimentation." The Lady's face grew flushed. "That's the beauty of our race, Gwen. Humanity can neither be contained or controlled. We proliferate regardless of the circumstances. With the meagrest aid, the slightest of hints, the most fragile seed of knowledge, we can bring about great booming Towers that defy distance to suck the marrow from Terra herself! Our benefactors may have withheld the true knowledge empowering magic— but Humankind overcame! The Dwarves sold us their Runecraft for food and materials, so we mimicked their Mandalas! The Mermen's attacks revealed the abundance of resource in the ocean, so now we harvest their kin, year on year!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lady paused for effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is undeniable that modern magic and its foundations were never ours. Yet, it is without a doubt that we Humans are the legitimate successors of Spellcraft as it now exists. Human magic lacks nuance, as the Hvítálfar would say, and stability, so say the Dwarves— but it's ours. Only in our hands, does it flourish, do you see?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do." Gwen felt as though passing through a threshold. "To surmise, the methodology of magic is akin to language, right? Incantations are the words moulding the mana, invocations its grammar, its resultant metaphors and synecdoches are the spells we shape. IMS— is arcane linguistics, for Humans. And like English, it is constantly evolving. Though its origins are myriad and rooted all over the world— from culture to culture, race to race, its semantics remain coherent enough to communicate every idea, from the simplest order to the most empathic Ode. What the Elves had begun, and we Humans propagated, is now a common and accessible linguistic system for all Humanity to tap into sorcery, heedless of racial and cultural backgrounds!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Loftus carefully lowered her tea. "Brilliantly surmised. Very concise. No wonder Henry saw something special in you. You're not just beauty and brawn, my dear! What a dangerously brainy little kitty you are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why isn't this common knowledge?" Gwen asked. "I feel embarrassed to be so delayed. Not even Master was forthcoming, and he taught me Dimension Door out of his very own Spellbook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, there's much you will need to un-learn. Since you mentioned Spellbooks, let's move onto that. The Grimoire, as you know, is a fundamental aspect of the Tower System your Master set up. The spells contained therein are accessible by anyone with the CCs and the talent, a pillar of the Mageocracy's centralised infrastructure. Had you stayed on the Frontier, you would have spent your whole life collating CCs to purchase the spells crafted by your betters. But now— furnished with proper access to the source of Spellcraft, you may compose your own. A spell, when deconstructed, is merely an arcane syntax, as you have interpreted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen understood what her matron was saying. Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man Magic Missile, and he'll roast squirrels for life. Pre-written spells were rote learning. True Spellcraft was academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another question?" The Lady was enjoying herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do." Gwen had been fermenting one since last year. "I have a question regarding Affinity. Is it possible for a Mage's Affinity to exceed 10?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lady cocked her head ever so slightly. "Worried about Miss Lindholm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's eyes grew wide and innocent. How did her patron discover Elvia's talent so quickly? What did the Lady know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I take the Familiar ritual was successful?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… Yes, ma'am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see." Maxine Loftus grew contemplative. "I suspected that at some junction, I will have to raise the topic of Miss Lindholm with you, though if you are acquiescent, I am more than happy to discuss the dilemma now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dilemma, ma'am?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Loftus carefully stirred the sugar. The tea set added the milk, though she did not take up the fragrant beverage. "First, let us address the matter of Miss Lindholm's undeserved Affinity. It is NOT fourteen. Magister Rendrey and Walken are right in suggesting that the script is in error. Miss Lindholm's original talent is admirable but common. Even with her Alraune, she remained merely impressive. Unlike you, her ascension would not be for another decade or two, or five, not until the Alraune matures— whereupon she shall make a passable Combat Cleric."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is Kiki not... suited for Evee?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why would it be? Let me be honest— the Alraune is wasted on her. I know a dozen students, Prime Mages like your Master Henry, who're still waiting to discover their life-long companions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh…" Gwen felt her heart prickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, the nature of Spirits and their acquisition is less predictable than the English weather. No amount of longing will gift them with Miss Lindholm's fortune."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortune? Gwen felt guilt lick her insides. If Sulfina hadn't gotten to Evee, Yue and Whetu in time, she would have shipped three desiccated carcasses back to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An excess of fortune, however, is a terrible thing," the Lady stated ominously. "I understand you have transactions with members of the Ordo Draconis, dear. What I don't understand is why you would offer up your dearest friend to be a 'Vessel'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A… 'Vessel'?" Gwen felt cold sweat soaking her dress. "What do you mean, ma'am?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Vessel, an Essence holder, a—" Lady Loftus appeared to study her face to see if she was lying. When Gwen's guileless orbs spoke of complete earnestness, her House Mistress grew incredulous. "Oh, dear… You didn't know?" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"I…" Gwen bit her lower lip. "I've sort of just blundered and blasted my way through obstacles thus far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goodness gracious. I take back what I said earlier." Lady Loftus raised a hypercritical brow. "You understand YOURSELF to be a Vessel of the Mythic that resides in Ayers Rock, do you not? Your brother-in-craft was as forthright as he could, but as you know, Henry was a deeply private individual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ma'am, do you know about Almudj?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should I know about Almudj?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen grew silent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen." The Lady's tone grew serious. "I am your custodian and patron. Peterhouse has thus invested so far, two Senior Magisters and a Meisterhood, not to mention countless favours. For your instruction, I may be giving up much more. In return, it is your responsibility, your very purpose, to live up to mine— and Henry's— expectations. You must make up for what Sobel destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And what is that?" Her tone grew low and agitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you recall what you told Henry?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A deterrent," Gwen recalled her grandstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Correct. Peace through the threat of absolute destruction— mutual if it must be. Wars are coming, kitten. We will need your talents in the days to come to prevent another Sydney."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't be serious." Gwen gulped. They were tottering from crisis to crisis, and she could hardly catch her breath. "With who?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With whoever wishes to threaten our cities. The Mermen, the Undead in Eastern Europe and North Korea, the savage Demi-humans of the steppes, the Elementals East of the Fire Sea; Spectre's shadow. We have been at peace, in a manner of speaking, for three decades, Gwen. Do you know how bloated the Empire has grown? How overtaxed the Communists have become? How ravenously the Americans plundered the New World? Humanity is a simmering vessel, and without the means to vent…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The magic kettle whistled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… We have strayed." The Lady sighed. "Back to the matter at hand. You are a Vessel, by definition if nothing else. Miss Lindholm is a Vessel. Each Vessel wishes for certain boons when they take on their agreement with their respective Mythics. You wished for life— I assume, to offset the Void ravaging your body; and Miss Lindholm wished for unparalleled proficiency in her profession of choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, the Affinity isn't because of Sen-sen—" Gwen almost bit her tongue. "That's the Ginseng… from the Mythic's sanctuary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Ginseng is the conduit," Lady Loftus clarified. "The more profound the conduit, the more conducive the contract. I wonder, what was your conduit?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So Elvia…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is no more improved than she would have been otherwise. Assuming the girl began with an Affinity of 4, I would place her Affinity at 8— a tragedy, considering what two Plant Mages could have achieved with the same opportunity. Think, Gwen; the Mageocracy has missed a chance to produce two facsimiles of Henry. Why didn't you listen to Ollie? Or Mattias? They're right, you know. One wonders why you take your senior's advice for nought. Had you made the right choice, two Great Houses would defend her to the last heir, while she could have remained simple and sheltered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen said nothing. Her mind was too numb to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, thanks to your generosity." Lady Loftus' criticism was without mercy. "Miss Lindholm will have to make up to us. A Mythic's Vessel makes the rarest of Mages, you of all people should know. Why else are you special? How many Void Mages may use Void Magic with impunity? Who can do what you can do, at your age? You've put Miss Lindholm in a precarious position, Gwen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What will happen to Elvia?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once her talents are verified." Lady Loftus was once again studying her face. "Your friend will be transferred into the Order of the Bath, where she shall work toward becoming a Knight Companion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colour in Gwen's cheeks rose several degrees. "No way. A Knight's Companion…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Is a title and a Rank, denoting membership in the Order of the Bath. There exist only twenty-four official posts otherwise." Lady Loftus sighed wistfully. "Good grief. The dangers of ignorance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry." Gwen was still reeling from the idea that she and Elvia were "Vessels". Why hadn't anyone told her before? Then again, who in her orbit had been an expert on Draconic vassals? Ayxin of course— but the Dragon Princess owed her nothing. If anything, their mutual admiration for Jun made them natural competitors. "Ma'am, is this common knowledge?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing involving Dragons can be common. In this regard, we have only hearsay. A better instructor than I... might know more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen tried to regulate her breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Which brings us to an unpleasant topic of conversation." Lady Loftus drew a Glyph in the air. The windows slowly swung inward, leaving the room utterly silent but for the crackling of the inscribed yew logs. "Gwen, can you clarify what your intentions are with Miss Lindholm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protect her with everything I've got, Knight or no Knight," Gwen stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… I mean as a companion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh… OOH." Gwen's lips made an "o".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Always check for crows on your outings…" Lady Grey pointed outside the window, were a pair of crows, ubiquitous in London, sat opposite the French windows. "Or use your Portable Habitat. Why in God's name would you do that sort of thing in plain view, when there's still light? At least wait for nightfall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah…" Gwen choked on embarrassment. She doubted her conversation with Elvia would have gone nearly as well if they had discussed it in the privacy of the Habitat's bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was just as well they were my Crows, and not Ravenport's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh thank God…" The unceasing revelations had made her quite breathless. "That said, milady, am I to understand you've been spying on me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Firstly." Lady Loftus raised a finger. "It is not my business to question how you spend your time, or with whom you find your fun. What I loath is your lack of discretion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understood." Gwen lowered her eyes. "I shall be cautious next time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Secondly." Lady Loftus raised a second finger. "Being a Vessel completely complicates one's political capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen grew silent. She empathised with her patron's position— but what about Evee? Had she inadvertantly fucked her friend sideways?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thirdly, should Miss Elvia elevate herself— and she shall— that will mark her as an Exalted of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath, a bearer of its burnished sun crest. Her duty means she shall not have you or anyone as a carnal companion. Should she renounce celibacy, her position and the Relic she bears—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And what if Evee doesn't want to enter the Ordo?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So long as she is a citizen of the Mageocracy, a healer, and a Vessel, what has been squandered will not be squandered again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She can't refuse?" Gwen's tone grew menacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why the upset? It's not as though you can deny your future Magisterhood." Lady Loftus remained unfazed. "The Mageocracy will not risk either of you slipping from its grasp; your extinction would be a preferable alternative— that or Stasis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I may be so ungrateful." Gwen fought back the death-chill in her chest. "May Elvia and I leave for the New World? I have received offers from them as well if you must know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, and endure WORSE terms? With folk who don't harken after Henry, who don't care for your companions? What would Gunther think of such ungracious behaviour? Not to mention Miss Lindholm, with her ordinary talent, would not survive a year in the Protestants' Lutheran Seminary. They'll break her like a bare-back heathen on the wheel. If you wish to cut and run, Gwen, I would recommend China. Naturally, we would withdraw our Magisters, and Wen's Meisterhood will be rescinded. But I am sure the Godless Communists would welcome a Void Mage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the Lady's sweetness was spent, Gwen realised that Maxine Loftus was far from gentle and beyond terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lady's candidness, however, was refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand." Gwen nodded. "My enquiry was… academic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And my advice merely hypotheticals." The Lady smiled. "Remember, whatever you wish for Miss Lindholm, think of your own future as the herald of our cause— consult someone… Richard perhaps, or Gunther, if you find us oldies wanting. Don't let either of your Affinities— or your patron, decide for you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand." Gwen took a deep breath. "… out of curiosity, Ma'am, just how much of my condition do you know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How much do you wish to divulge?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd prefer none."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then leave it at that. Didn't Henry say that Magisters and secrets all go together like Dragons and Virgins? It comes with the title, dear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One last thing, if I may be so forward— society and nobility aside, what would the Tower, the Mageocracy even, perceive of my… indelicacy with Miss Lindholm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matron of Peterhouse smirked. "It's not all doom and gloom, Gwen. Let me conjure a Greater Image for you. As you are now? You will lose a significant portion of your freedom. Later, if you graduate a Magister of the Middle Faction, most if not all will turn a blind eye, as your worth far outweighs the trouble of censure. And if and when you become a Tower Master, even the Grand Master of the Order of the Bath will grin and bear whatever you wish to do with their Companion. He may even see your affection as a leash, well worth a sullied Companion. Beyond that..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maxine Loftus took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… there are two endgames. If you become a great bower for the Mageocracy as Henry was, then truly, there are very few shackles to your freedom other than those of your own making— family, Apprentices, favoured folk. If you become its vorpal sword— as Sobel was meant to be, then who would dare question anything you do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see." Gwen rested both trembling hands on her knees. "Thank you, Maxine. For being so sincere with me. In the same vein, may I know more about my Master? I know so very little about him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You may." Her patron willed away the tea tray. "But our present lesson is at an end. I have business elsewhere. Do remember that the IIUC's final results will be out in a fortnight, so plan your London outings accordingly. Heed well my advice, child. Speak to your 'friends'. If you feel depressed, go and see the sights in Cambridge. Also, ask Keridwen to change you into something more official. You are, after all, a Cambridge celebrity…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="48" src="https://imgur.com/Ys9pKEb.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="235"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nightingale College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first medic-call of the year sounded across the courtyard of the research building. Though not a principal port of call in London, the teaching hospital does cater to patient overflows arriving from combat zones all over the Mageocracy and its territories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep within the hospital's bowels, the Teleportation Circle linking it and the Shard flared Mithril and quicksilver, pulsing in tune to the siren's wail keening after the hospital's skeleton staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A physician in customary white, stained with congealed gore, appeared beside a gurney to greet the rush of nurses and doctors stationed since the evening. Promptly, the incoming physician drew a Glyph in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Magus Joseph Carmichael, requesting triage handover to Nightingales!" the transferring doctor called out. "The patient is Magus William Fitzgerald, Code Orange, suffering from acute pulmonary obstruction due to quasi-magical diffusion of the alveolar. Currently, the patient has a situ Weiss-Hermann portable Ventilator implanted via trach. Pharmacology reports 5mg of Prilosec per alchemy cycle, catalysed by 1mg of Stirgenix. Potion injectors are infused with 12mg Ipratropium infused with 30-70 Wyvern serum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The receiving practitioner caught the glowing Glyph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Magus Derek Hope, initiating handover." Hope took one scroll through the data slate and deflated. "Jesus... are you serious?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes. Acute trauma of the left lumbar, punctured lung, poison, and Arachnid Hex, tier 4-5."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Active?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Repressed, for now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Christ, he's sixty-four? Multiple combat tours… old injuries— the Boer Conflict, the Ashantee War— That's two decades ago. How the hell is he still standing? Why was an old vet like that still serving in Ireland?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't ask me." Doctor Carmichael shook his head. "We're barely keeping the floor open over at Dublin at the moment. I hear the staging zone on the Isle's a bloodbath."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dare I ask why Magus Fitzgerald has arrived at our teaching hospital rather than Black's or Royal Alfred's or Cambridge?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't. Do you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The room grew uncomfortably silent. &lt;br/&gt;The gurney's diagnostic magic beeped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not at all." Hope swore internally. The patient, as far as he could tell, was a political case. For various reasons, the older generation of combat vets possessed bodies insensitive to magical healing. Some of them had wounds from Hexes that no longer existed, thanks to the Mageocracy's extreme prejudice during the Beast Tide. Others had scar tissues both inside and out, piling on top of damage decades in the making. Nonetheless, any hospital that allowed a "War Hero" to die received a black mark. To send such a patient to a teaching hospital to allow the younger physicians to test their mettle under the pretence of triage, was a way to preserve the reputation of the Great Hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who's rostered right now?" Magus Hope turned to his team of nurses. "In the Emergency, I mean."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctor Lindholm and Witherspoon," the machine-nurse replied without hesitation. "Ser Witherspoon is a fine physician, and as for Doctor Lindholm, she's the one with the reputation, sir, she's why Lady Aston did the shakeup last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Aston— do you mean the trouble maker who got herself a pledged Knight of St Michael by sucking eggs?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yessir."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should go." Doctor Carmichael returned to the circle. "I assume our patient will receive your utmost duty of care? He is, I should remind you, a holder of the Gallant Cross. There aren't too many Maguses with that sort of standing left in London. The home office will not be pleased."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portal flared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Carmichael fled, Hope turned to his attendant. "What else do you know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not much. Doctor Lindholm has recused herself from Lady Astor after the Director returned to Cliveden. She is also a close associate of Lady Rothwell, though only the SRC President and not the family. Beyond that, I do not believe she has any sponsors. Oh, she also chums with one of the Frontier contestants from the IIUC, the Void Sorceress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You seem to know an awful lot, Marie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's common knowledge in the ward, sir. After she stirred up all that trouble with Lady Astor and got Nancy and the girls removed from GOS, here at Nightingale, we've kept an eye on her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the gurney, the diagnostic displays began to issue the inevitable warning signs. As expected, the alchemical infusions were failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very well." Hope acknowledged the time for deliberation and discussion was over. "Put him with Miss Elvia. Send her an assistant as well. Tell her to do her best— and that she won't be held accountable even if the Magus succumbs to his natural condition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She won't?" The nurse appeared disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One glare from the Magus was enough to wilt his nurses' questioning eyes. The stupidity of these waifs was beyond comprehension. Were they afflicted with Enfeeble Minds from birth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go now!" Hope barked, tapping his slate to confirm the transfer. "And don't forget to tell Miss Elvia we have the utmost confidence in her ability to apply her training."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">500619</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 08:56:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 348 - Buyer's Remorse</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/498475</link><description>&lt;p&gt;"Gwen, NO." Elvia's svelt figure interposed itself between Golos and the impending eruption of ultraviolence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From raising the hand of God, Gwen found herself suddenly diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Evee, step aside." Her voice grew low and loud like impending thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen. No." Elvia's response was accompanied by Kiki crawling up her arm to sit on one shoulder. Before Sen-sen, the Alraune had proved too heavy for the small-framed healer. Now, that was no longer the case. "This isn't Lord Golos' problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hell it isn't!" Gwen growled. "Gogo! You know what you did! Get your ass over here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For aiding your mate in attaining her heart's desire?" Golos lacked even the barest token of repentance. "Upset that I satisfied where you could not, Calamity? You should be thankful for our 'sister' receiving what you had left disappointed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our? Is Ruxin a part of this? Is Ayxin?" Her mind furiously worked through the list of Dragons who might traffic Elvia against her. "Is your &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; father involved?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You overstep," Golos snapped back, leaking Dragon fear in the manner of an upset puss dissuading predators. "Calamity, watch yourself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwennie!" Elvia stomped her feet, her blue eyes flashing with annoyance. Usually, Gwen would have remarked that her healer's upset made her all the more adorable. With Sen-sen, however, a truly upset Evee was a catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuck!&lt;/em&gt; She ground her teeth. She knew she should have diced the little Ginseng fucker for spice when she had the chance. "Evee, you're not yourself, that's the Essence talking. Why this? Almudj is big enough for both of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Almudj is Almudj. And just as it knows its mind." Elvia's golden hair streamed as she spoke. "I know mine. You're not Almudj's sock puppet, and neither am I."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Evee, seriously." Gwen wanted to reach out, grab Golos, and wring the Wyvern like a wet rag until all the blood and poop oozed from every orifice. Her Evee! Her poor little Evee! Look at what they did to her beautiful Evee! "Don't do this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am serious, Gwen. Dead serious." Elvia approached, leading with her eyes and her small, glistening mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen took a step back. "Evee…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Or are you saying my choice doesn't matter?" Elvia's accusation snapped like a whip. Elvia's irises were blue, so blue that they hurt Gwen's eyes. "Must you choose for me? Must a higher power choose for me? For all of the Nazarene's divinity, Father Maxwell says the Almighty gives us free will. Do you deny what I've chosen for myself, Gwen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Evee, I didn't say that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then a little respect would go a long way, I think." Elvia's words crammed Gwen's tongue back down her throat. "Gwennie, you can't just get mad at Gogo without asking why."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen wanted to say "of course" she could; as a grown woman, she could do and say whatever the fuck she wanted. But she kept her mouth shut because she could see in Elvia's eyes she would have to bypass her healer first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You going to hide behind Evee, Gogo? A big Wyvern like you?" She tried a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see you squirm, Calamity." The Wyvern appeared to be enjoying himself. Why the fuck wasn't her Wyvern an idiot at a time like this? "Haha! As Father said, there is a foil to everything! As water is to fire! Metal to wood! So you are helpless against our Moxt Myvish! She's your Argonite!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argonite being the draconic equivalent of kidney stones, or so Golos had once overshared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen felt her face grow hot. She was so pissed off she could feel the Lightning encircling her irises, empowered by a feverish desire to make Golos into a Caliban sock puppet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your hypertension is at a dangerous level, Gwennie." Elvia reached out with a compassionate hand. Gwen stood her ground. If she gave in now, what precedent would that set for Evee? For her stupid drake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calm Emotion!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft and gentle streams of mana flooded Gwen's conduits, bathing her in lukewarm water. The anger that had simmered against her throat and made her voice hoarse suddenly abated. Unbidden, her heart-rate slowed, and the depth of her breathing grew shallow. Without biting her tongue, she would have moaned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"God damn it, Evee…" She breathed out, deflating as her rage died like Golos double-teamed by Big Birds. "What am I going to do with you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A hug would be nice." Her healer was inches away. "There's still five hours until midnight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As commanded, she hugged her healer, allowing the sickly sweetness to envelop her annoyance like raw honey. The girl's soulful presence was akin to the milk of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hee." A pair of prying eyes interrupted her revelry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you staring at?" She snapped at her leering Wyvern. "Fuck off, Gogo. Go back to Ruxin and tell him I am very cross with you. Next time, if there's a next time..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ingrate hag," Golos grumbled. Languishingly, he stepped back into the Summoning Circle. Momentarily, the Wyvern's humanoid shape flashed blue and white, turning Rendfrey's workshop quicksilver before his material body dis-corporated across space and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A precious silence descended, accompanied by the stink of curry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Miss Elvia…" Walken gently raised his voice, understandably impatient. "If I may ask…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her healer left her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe Sen-sen's leaves can be crushed and infused within Miliberg's Remedy-All Tonic to suppress Angie's condition," Elvia acknowledged Walken's concern. "Gradually, her constitution will improve, though I am unsure how many dosages it may take. May I recommend you take her to GOS, where I work, and put up a slate for Angie?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, that's satisfactory." Walken nodded. "Thank you, Miss Lindholm. I'll do that tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unused to her assertiveness, Elvia's face grew scarlet. "Think nothing of it, Magister Walken, you've been such an indispensable help to Gwen and myself. It's I who owe you a favour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hahaha..." Walken too, wilted under Elvia's sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corner of Gwen's left eye twitched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... And my most sincere apologies, Magister Rendfrey." Elvia bowed to the owner of the workshop. "I haven't gotten used to Sen-sen's power yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No problem, not at all." The now-recovered Rendfrey mopped his forehead. "The old heart isn't what it used to be. Dragon Fear! How exhilarating!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Allow me." Elvia raised a hand, "Peace be upon you, Magister. Aid!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A golden halo encircled the Enchanter for a split second, disappearing as quickly as it appeared, suffusing Rendfrey's face with unbridled vitality. Straightening his back and neck, the Magister suddenly stood taller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh my." Magister Rendfrey inhaled and exhaled with great enthusiasm. "My girl, we need to get you to a Cog-Chamber! I insist, and I shall pay! What I wouldn't give to see your biometrics!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Walken's glib coaxing and a promise of favours from Rendfrey, the party of four arrived at a rotund Cog-Chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen wetted her lips at the intimate familiarity. The Cognition Chamber which they now occupied was the same as the one Henry had used to teach her, a memory that made her chest sore. How strange it was that the shoe was on the other foot— that she now plumbed Elvia's potential, while Evee stood in her place, wondering what lurked inside her Astral Body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shall we recluse ourselves?" Gwen applauded Walken's foresight to offer the girls privacy. Different from biometric readings, the matter of one's Astral Soul was deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please." Elvia bowed her head. "We shall soon be done, Lord Magisters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken and Rendfrey exchanged a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, of course. Let us waste no time. You girls wanted to see the New Year's fireworks, yes?" Rendfrey added regretfully. "You won't want to miss that! What a wonderful occasion to celebrate with a show of colour! That said..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rendfrey!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, yes..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Operator, you may begin," Gwen announced to the general air once they were alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air thrummed. &lt;br/&gt;The distance disappeared. &lt;br/&gt;The mirrored lake interior manifested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And upon that illusory, parallel plane, a divine presence dawned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Holy shit, Evee…" Gwen had never seen Elvia's post-Sydney Astral Body, and so could not comment on Elvia's Affinity before Sen-sen's capitulation. To her knowledge, Elvia was gifted, but not so talented as to receive an invitation to Nightingales without Gunther, placing the girl at an Affinity apex of four-on-five at best. For Sydney, such an Affinity was well above average. In the Mageocracy's heartland, the benchmark for receiving the esoteric craft of Faith-weaving demanded purer talents. "What am I even looking at?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's so much mana..." Her healer's untainted, joyous excitement was turning Gwen's bones to jelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sen-sen! Kiki!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia's Spirits appeared beside her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ARRUGH!" In the Cog-Chamber, one's eyelids only worked marginally. Gwen had only felt such blinding, stabbing pain once before— when Alesia decided to show off in front of Henry and had seared their newest sister's retinas. This time, it took several circles of Essence to adjust to the lumen range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kiki! Kiki!" The Alraune bathed in the light from her mistress, visibly growing taller and plumper. As for the blasted Draconic Ginseng, it fed its mistress a steady stream of raw mana through their Empathic Link, their conduit so thick as to distort the illusory space conjured by the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do you think?" Elvia twirled, or not, Gwen couldn't tell because Elvia was a stadium flood-light. In ripples, Positive Energy rolled out from around the girl's feet, brushing up against Gwen's heels like thick, heavy water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a word, Gwen stepped from her Mary Janes and stood upon the Cognition Chamber's chilly floor, barefoot and bare-legged. Visibly, the outward ebb of Elvia's Positive Energy, that golden nectar of mana, began to swirl about her vague Void and electrified Lightning. Where their Astral Body's edges met, she saw for the first time, the outer walls of her energy-hungry aura absorbing Elvia's pearlescent motes of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pleasantness was indescribable. &lt;br/&gt;The tactility of Evee's Positive Energy halo was different from the violent consumption and the cresting climaxes offered by Caliban's Consume. Her healer's blessing was, Gwen blushed, a thing of womb water, a gentle envelopment that made her calm and sleepy and docile. For someone like herself, who subsisted on Almudj and lived each night as the patron saint of insomnia, the temptation to simply drown herself in Evee's chamber of the sea was all too real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does Sen-sen have a combat form?" Gwen changed the topic. "Does Kiki?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia shook her head. "Kiki is still young, though she could be used if I need battlefield control. As for Sen-sen, I don't think I can command it's full power, at least not yet. Can you teach me how to use Dragon-Essence?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There existed not a single ounce of desire within the entirety of Gwen's being that wanted to pass on the knowledge Ayxin had imparted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwennie?" Elvia's imploring eyes pulsed with star-fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… sure." Gwen folded like a napkin. "It's largely instinctual though, all I can teach you is the meditation and a general idea of how to wrangle the impulse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thanks, Gwennie. Let me finish up for the sensors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a final word, her healer's Astral Body turned supernova, bathing the room in light, casting behind Gwen a dancing line of macabre shadows, writhing like uncertain Calibans, eating away at the fabric of space and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Year's Eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near midnight, the Thames lit up with vibrant Illusions and cacophonic Evocation. From behind the gargoyles lining the upper strata of Nightingale College, Gwen sat with her healer resting against her shoulder. Around the pair, their Familiars ran free: Kiki and Sen-sen paced around the rooftop, Caliban played pillow against her back, and Ariel drifted like a carefree cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the eclectic, floral atmosphere was heartbreakingly evocative, Gwen's heart grew heavy, and not just with the weight of her Evee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had wanted a stronger Elvia. &lt;br/&gt;She had fancied her Evee to be special, unique, a cut above the rest. &lt;br/&gt;That was why, unsure of what else she could offer Evee, she had given Elvia crystals, bling, and Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen understood what it meant to be the victim of the Yinglong's Draconic Essence. She knew all to well its intoxicating effect, the powers it offered, the way it bolstered her confidence to supernatural heights. She also knew that the Yinglong's Essence came at a cost—and that cost was a little snippet of one's self, the portion that was doubtful, cautious and meticulous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sen!" Sen-sen wiggled back and forth, terrified and yet intrigued by the height, enjoying its restored limbs. Sulkily, Gwen observed that within its tiny body rested a reservoir far more significant than what Gwen herself had accessed, and now its resources were Evee's to abuse as the healer saw fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kiki!" the Alraune Sprite appeared more humanoid than its prior incarnation as well. It's leg tendrils were more limb-like and less akin to green caterpillars. It even had a little waist to go with its bulbous upper body, shaped like a rare stargazer lily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And though Elvia had placated her unrest with a darting peck on the lips, a sourness remained, like sugarcane left fermenting for too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it because Elvia was no longer hers alone? &lt;br/&gt;Or was it because Elvia had pledged herself to a different patron? &lt;br/&gt;Over-possessiveness was poison, Gwen had learned the lesson from Dr Monroe, but she just couldn't shake the feeling that a precious thing had been denied. It was a perception that, if she had to vocalise her dissent, was akin to having one's stock portfolio two-grand short of a million, missing that sweet sixth digit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great cheer rose from below. The hospital staff, those soon to be on duty, took the opportunity to share the joy of entering a new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cold?" Elvia adjusted her head so that she rested yet more of her body on Gwen's torso. "Here, I'll warm us up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gradual heat transferred from Elvia's body to hers. With hyper-tier Affinity, Walken had said; unusual things happened to a Mage's Astral Body. With her Affinity to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning, much of her body chemistry had been affected. As for the Void, that she was alive and well was itself a miracle of modern Spellcraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Evee, with the addition of TWO spirits, one Sulfina's wily Junior, the other a Ginseng masochist, had gone beyond even that. Earlier, when the script from the Cognition Chamber spat out its numbers, both Magisters had steadfastly denied the accuracy of its numeric output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An Affinity of FOURTEEN?" Walken had raised a brow before passing the data slate to Rendfrey. "Well done, Gwen. We have coaxed a Celestial Archon from the Positive Plane. Our next step should be to call the Church of England and tell them we recovered the long-lost Spirit of Saint Cuthbert. Your knighting ceremonies are next week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A hyper-tier Cleric would cause a wave with the Vatican, what with their anointed saints and all." Rendfrey chuckled nervously, mopping sweat from his brow. "So er… we agree to keep this between us for now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes." Walken passed the data slate back to Gwen. "The instrument isn't made for measuring twin-Spirits. I shall go and lodge Elvia's Spirit Registration with the Tower. We can leave the specifics for later. No doubt, there will be questions for Miss Lindholm shortly. Best leave this to the state's Clerical apparatus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you get back to Great Osmond Street," Gwen likewise warned her healer. "Try not to bring back the dead accidentally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like you?" Her healer's lips were coy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken coughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen recalled shivering then. The Magisters had downplayed the fact, but she could see on their faces the beginnings of trouble which none of them was equipped to forestall. Perhaps that was why her nerves remained frayed even now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had she, in her haste, in her love, in her all-consuming desire for Elvia's elevation, bypassed the threshold of theoretical Spellcraft? Had Elvia, the recipient of best intentions, accidentally ascended into quasi-Godhood? She had wanted Elvia to be unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christ Almighty&lt;/em&gt;! Gwen fought back a morbid impulse. Like the fabled Victor Von Frankenstein, what had she created? &lt;br/&gt;And the bleeding Draconic Essence! &lt;br/&gt;Had the Cog-Chamber even taken &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in to account?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODS! What would Yue say when she found out?&lt;br/&gt;What would their oldest friend do to her if she found out how badly she had mangled Evee's body? Thinking of Yue erupting with the fire and fury of a fully-formed Tandy, Gwen's limbs grew covered with goosebumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen, you're shivering again." Elvia remained oblivious. What was the healer thinking? Gwen wondered. Probably how many more Blessings she could give at the Isle before she was OoM. Her healer's selflessness could be infuriating at times. "How's that possible? Between Almudj and my Bless, you can't be ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am just…" Gwen licked her lips. Evee's hot waterbottle aura was making her a little dizzy. "… so happy, is all. The fireworks, this city, everything's just so beautiful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is, isn't it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bung! Pa—Pa—Pa—BOOM! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A floral display in the form of a peace lily, white-hot and glimmering with mana, showered the pair with their multi-coloured light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cheer broke out all across the riverbank, welcoming the arrival of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One supernova. &lt;br/&gt;Two supernovae. &lt;br/&gt;Three supernovae in quick succession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Happy New Year, Gwennie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Happy New Year, Evee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Evees, each at a fraction of the healer's Cog-Chamber luminosity, erupted all over London's skyline, turning night into day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 1st. &lt;br/&gt;Morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her nostrils still hinting at her healer's heavenly redolence, Gwen left her healer's college for Cambridge. In her immediate future, she would return every few days in the first week of January. Her precious hours, however, would be for business, such as at the Isle of Dogs, or to check up on Evee's progress with Draconic meditations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new year. &lt;br/&gt;A new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back home, on New Year's Day in Australia, most families opted for a spring clean, meaning every window and door of every house would be open, littering the lawn with trash from the last twelve months. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In London, with the temperature below six and snow up to the ankle, there was no such bustle. The magically inclined families would mostly be recovering from their food coma, lazing about in cosy houses with logs of inscribed yew burning gently, drawing in heat from the Elemental Plane of Fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NoMs, if they were well-provisioned, would have something to celebrate as well. If not, then as little body heat should be expended as possible in this trying time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling affected by the view, she circled the blanketed city as it slept. The fallen snow had obscured the city's Districts, hiding the unseen suffering lurking in its industrial borders. When Gwen did a lap around her demesne, the children waved at her. For her subjects, the sight of the sorceress in her out of season dress had become commonplace. Now, with their bellies full of SPAM and the streets cleared of mud and refuse, the kids had excess energy to burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen waved back, happy that the mud of Mudchute, salt of the earth had gained a little reprieve. When she circled the farm, Wally the caretaker gave her a smart salute, then commanded the dogs to give a great howl as she passed. It was a simple gesture, but one that made her well-pleased, a feeling that juxtaposed her prior oppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this Noblesse Oblige? She wondered. What had begun as sophistry to suck up to the old Magister was now manifested in reality. If her Master was alive right now, would he be weaving a garland of praises for her head, and would he be praising her with fatherly hugs and kisses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to believe sometimes; when she stepped back to take it all in, of all that had happened and what was soon to transpire. What began in Sydney as a vague desire to survive comfortably had morphed into a chimeric monstrosity with more heads and tails than she could count. At first, plunged into the inky, Spellcraft sea, she had blundered onto her self-driven quest out of jaw-clenching reflex. Like Pac-man acting on instinct, she had consumed foe after foe without overthinking, desiring only to live her second life freely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promptly, she entertained a dangerous thought. She had time, and indeed, the capital to do an "Hai Song". With what she had amassed thus far, she could retreat to Sydney, take up a side-gig clearing out Mermen or difficult and dug-in monsters to bide her time. Barring that, she could even find a cushy, laid-back position within the CCP if she so desired— although that might piss off Percy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point was that she could— but would not— be Hai's daughter. &lt;br/&gt;She had made hard promises to too many people whose lives now depended on her maintaining momentum. That, and she was caught up in the undertow of things bigger than herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen sped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She felt trapped. An ironic emotion, seeing as she was blasting across the English countryside at over a hundred kilometres an hour, an austere member of a select Cabal with the clout to go wherever they pleased. Wanting to leave the feeling behind, she pumped more and more mana into her spell, shrinking the radius of her barrier so that she could feel the whistling wind scraping against Gunther's double-glazed shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had been reborn into this world, free, in a fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she had the legacy left her by Master, Henry Kilroy, compounded by her siblings' promises to hunt down Sobel. She had the burden of Tonglv's success and the rise of her family's fortunes in Shanghai. Elsewhere, she had Mayuree and Marong in Myanma, and dragons dreaming of Centurion and Legion. There was also the IIUC's aftermath, Lady Grey's patronage, the Isle and its expectant folk, the printing press, the promise of Deepholm. &lt;br/&gt;Evee's rebellion.&lt;br/&gt;For all her freedom, she was everywhere in chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unconsciously, Gwen upped her velocity once more. &lt;br/&gt;Far below, confused farmhands waved at the rumbling contrail of mist and snow, unsure of whether this New Year's omen signalled weal or woe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">498475</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 11:11:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 347 - From Kith to Kin</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/496652</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The following morning, Gwen flew Elvia and herself back to London to meet Walken. Once the shellshock passed, she came to a nerve-pinching acceptance of her new reality— that she had once again indulged in what Petra had remarked as gluttonous masochism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, she felt happy. Deliriously happy, like Bacchus drunk-charioting after a Friday grape binge. On the other, she felt disturbed, like an insomniac wondering whether they'll ever lay with Hypnos again. The high was nice, but she had been burned before. What would be the cost of overreach this time? An Icarian descent, perhaps— first celestial, then meteoric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;SPLAT&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now though, with the intoxicating scent of Evee in her arms, it was easy to dismiss the Leviathan of love parked off the coast of Brighton, floundering in the shallows. Perhaps that was why she had declined Walken's offer of a free Teleport to London. The old dog's interrogating gaze aside, she had to post-process the consequence of her choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had told Evee that she loved her for her simplicity. &lt;br/&gt;But now, with Elvia so invested, she felt that their relationship had become anything but simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had told Evee would make her special. &lt;br/&gt;But not like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then what? Her mind demanded her hypocritical self. &lt;em&gt;What does Gwen Song want from Elvia Lindholm? &lt;/em&gt;Should Evee remain as a virgin handmaiden?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that wasn't it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within her pocket dimension, Caliban rested fitfully.&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, Gwen felt a novel desire to strangle something soft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwennie, what's the Summon Familiar ritual like?" Elvia yawned, breaking the monotony of constant locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glad for the distraction, Gwen did her best to recollect the first time she'd met Caliban and Ariel. She was fifteen, and she had no idea that her Master had pumped a Magister's treasure trove into a tier 1 Spell designed initially for novices. And so, like a little fool, she had gone with the flow without a second thought, letting her imagination run wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you aware of how the spell works, Evee?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand the theory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good. Okay. So, after you mix your mana into the circle, the Mandala does all the grunt work. You'll feel a distortion in the Material Plane— but since Sen-Sen is here already, I guess that part's not important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mmm-hmm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then, here's going to be a tugging feeling in your chest. Your Astral Soul is going to feel like it has been prodded, or pushed. That would be your Familiar's Ego. Again, Ariel and Caliban were both infants then, so there wasn't anything to dominate. Sen-sen's willing— or it better be— so all you need to do is let it come into your Astral Body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen paused to find the right words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Caliban, the exchange was more explicit. Cali was a ball of hunger demanding a pound of flesh to keep it manifested in the real world. Ariel was easier, I wanted a companion to counter Caliban, and so it came without compulsion. Again, with Sen-sen, I don't know if you'll have trouble controlling it or not, what with its age and lineage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia inclined her chin. "I'll do my best."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know you will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sped up, concurrently ensuring that her shield kept the buffeting wind at bay. If she had been a lesser Mage, she would have long been OoM had she simultaneously maintained Flight and the desired to keep their clothes unruffled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the disappearing distance, the taste in her mouth grew bittersweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After tonight, she told herself, Evee would return to her classes at Nightingales and practicum at GOS. Gwen herself would be confined to Cambridge, likely in a dungeon with a train of tutors each eager to bludgeon knowledge into her brain. Other than the rare weekend, she would see her healer twice, at best thrice a month, assuming their timetables aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would she be sad? Gwen wondered, fearful of the strange relief scratching the inside of her ribcage. She had only two weeks to spend with Elvia, only now, it felt like a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an eye-watering meal at the Tower of Tandoori, Gwen and Elvia arrived at the Tower of London. At lunch, Elvia spoke at length about her brother and her family and how Gwen's Long Range Message Device had been a godsend in keeping contact with her lost kin. Gwen reciprocated by speaking at length about Percy's burgeoning talents in Shanghai, about his girlfriend Mei, and their contributions at Shenyang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, just past three, they arrived at the Shard. As it was nine hours before the Big Ben tolled in the new year, the administrative staff had made the lobby both festive and inviting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the desks were as busy as ever, Walken had paid good CCs for the Tower's time, affording unmolested transit from the marbled anterior to the Shard's multi-dimensional interior. Unlike Sydney's maze of gravitation platforms, the state of the art Shard utilised a system of Teleportation Circles to securely, and discretely, transfer Mages to their desired destination. As the unofficial capital of Spellcraft in the Britannic Mageocracy, the Shard's mastery of dimensional magic was a cut above its central continent cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You must be Magus Song and Miss Lindholm." A wizened Magister in a crimson artificer's robe, studded with Glyphed pockets, led the pair into his workshop. Bespectacled in gold, the man's wild hair was a proud badge indicating his profession as a master of the Enchantment School. "I am Magister Gilbert Rendfrey, Senior Enchanter here at the Shard. Magister Walken is already inside."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the exterior, the Shard resembled a minimalist blade of glass, crystal and steel. It's interior's "interior", however, was tailored to each Magister's taste. As Gwen's party would be borrowing Magister Rendfrey's studio, they entered a smoky abode studded with magical bric-a-brac, with exotic materials lining the walls and spilling from every cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vision of Walken, prone on his stomach, soon appeared behind the threshold, halfway levitating from the floor, painstakingly etching the Greater Familiar Mandala with a sizzling inscriber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chamber itself was atypical of the spacious sub-spaces popularly utilised for discrete experimentation. Once inside, the volume of the room rapidly expanded until it was almost the size of a modest warehouse. The air was crisp, and barring the unsettling grey-space near the edges, there was even a temperate ocean breeze, smelling faintly of morning brine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Gwen, the disorientation lasted only a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eric," Gwen greeted her Magister, sulky at how hard Angie's father was willing to labour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took Walken a good ten seconds to realign himself. The Magister was in good health, but he was no longer spry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen. Elvia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Magister Walken." Elvia curtsied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a problem." Walken wiped his hands on a bit of cloth. "Rendfrey?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mmm… yes, we appear to be the victim of an inventory oversight." The Magister touched a guilty finger to his beard. "It rarely happens, but it does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's missing?" Gwen examined the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dragon blood, actually." Rendfrey adjusted his spectacles. "We have decided to proceed nonetheless because Magister Walken informed me you have access… to live samples?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen turned to examine the sheepish Walken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Audrey and I invested a lot of CCs to get this done as soon as possible," the Magister explained. "Hiccups were anticipated, I would imagine. We should consider our selves in luck that the missing ingredient is readily available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen masticated Walken's words. "… do you mean Golos?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless you happen to have a vial of something more sanguine," Walken said. "You haven't been very forthcoming on Golos' origins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'll get the whole picture once you start your job," she acknowledged his concern. One by one, her thoughts flittered through Ayxin, Ruxin and Golos. Of the trio, asking Ayxin for a pint was unthinkable. Ruxin might be willing to part with his blood if given enough incentives, while Golos, as Walken had guessed, was a malleable target. "So I am to summon Golos?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should mention the ritual does not necessarily need Dragon Blood," the Enchanter raised a hand. "Magister Walken is testing my hypothesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need a resonating medium to act as the catalyst," Walken quickly explained. "Your Ginseng is very old, and bred in close vicinity to the Yinglong, or so you said. Without sacrificing sacred blood to shackle the Ginseng's ego, Elvia may not be able to access that part of its lineage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You mean, the part Angie needs," Gwen clarified for her researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Undoubtedly." Walken raised both hands in defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's lips pursed. &lt;br/&gt;To her, a committed father was a foreign thing. &lt;br/&gt;But for now, their interests aligned. She wanted Elvia to gain as much benefit from Sen-sen as possible, and agreeably, Walken wished to maximise the potential of Sen-sen being able to produce a panacea. Since she wanted Walken's loyalty, it was only fair that she met her future executive halfway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right, where do I set up?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just over there" Rendfrey appeared entirely enthralled by the exchange. "A Thunder Wyvern with a mythic bloodline? I haven't felt this excited since we started processing Griffin Blood!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in the history of the Britannic Mageocracy, the city played host to a scion of the Yinglong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want my blood?" Golos breathed down at Gwen and Elvia's face, sending their hair flying all over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a litre or two," Gwen covered her nose. "You've got plenty to give. Just look at the size of that gut. Not much exercise at Ruxin's?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've reneged on your promise," Golos sulked, his scales and spinal feathers bristling in turn. "I smell the scent of death on you fresh as a fat Eel-kin. You've been having fun. Did you eat another Wyrm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A foreign worm," Gwen nodded. "It was disgusting. All slimy and earthy, very gamy, you won't like it, trust me. How's your brother?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He awaits your promised hoard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On that front, we're on track." Gwen felt a vague camaraderie with the Wyvern she hadn't seen for a week, like meeting a companion from the past after a lengthy absence. "How's Phelara?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Still brooding. Ruxin has a keen interest in her homeland. Big brother wants to know when you're going back for the Da-peng."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In good time," Gwen promised. "Best let sleeping birds lie for now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm…" Her Wyvern huffed at Elvia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Greetings, Lord Golos," Elvia beamed. "It's a pleasure to meet you. Sen-sen, say hi."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SEN!" The Ginseng fell on its face, performing a kowtow. "Sen! Sen!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mmm…" Golos' nostrils flared. He sucked in the air around Elvia, then licked his tongue, tasting her presence. "And something else as well, the old one?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen knew that Golos had a better nose than most, but the lizard's present perception was impressive beyond all comprehension. "Very nice, Golos. Not only does your nose detect magic, but it also detects Essence?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not all beings that can be eaten should be eaten," Golos announced wisely. "Ruxin says this is because you never know when someone's progenitor decides to eat you in turn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wise lad, that Ruxin. Did you catch up with Ryxi lately? I asked about Lulu before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Missing your Kenshi mate already?" Golos' laughter came in rolling waves. "She was a feisty one. Ryxi says she's a handful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gogo..." Gwen was glad that Elvia could not speak nor translate Draconic. "Just as not everything can be eaten, you should also learn the difference between friendship and fornication. For example, we're friends, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golos leaned in closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't want to mount you anyway." The Wyvern huffed snot over her chest. "Too old."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia stared on innocent while Walken choked, then began to cough uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen pushed the massive, reptilian face away. "Thanks, Gogo. That makes me rest easier at night. Now pass me a pint, you sleazy slug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wyvern appeared hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can compel the root," he offered, simultaneously unfolding its massive wings. "Sen! In the name of thy creator— &lt;em&gt;TYRTROL!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SEN!" Sen-sen turned over to show its belly, then laid flat on the ground— a root on chopping board, awaiting inevitable dissection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's cutting-finger itched. Give her another hundred grams of pure, unadulterated Sen-sen for her future cache of Maotai and the Dwarves shall be dancing in the palm of her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"See?" Golos grinned, looking more smug than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walken?" Gwen turned to her Conjurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rendfrey, what do you think?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With all due respect to Lord Golos here." Rendfrey appeared wholly impressed with the Wyvern's amiable performance thus far. "I am ill-equipped to comment. Dragon-tongue is not Spellcraft. The direct alteration of reality through force-of-will is a higher tier of study than mortal magic, I fear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Blood it is then." Gwen turned back Golos. Pointing to his wings, she made a cutting motion with her hand. "You want to do this— or me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bah—" Golos extended his neck until a particularly thick part presented itself. "Take it from here, Calamity, between the feathers— wing wounds itch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good boy." She stroked the Wyvern again to show her approval. "Keep this up, and maybe we can go for a stroll in London, get you some genuine Chicken Tikka Masala from the Tower of Tandoori."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golos sniffed her lips. "Intriguing. I have scented something familiar near Ruxin's abode, though only on the plants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I strongly advise against that— " Walken interjected. "Outside of this pocket dimension, I am afraid Lord Golos is going to fare very poorly indeed. Assuming he can resist the resonance given off by the city's four-dozen Shielding Cores, the Griffin Guards shall subdue us within the minute, and then we'll be in gaol, all of us, with her Majesty's Cabal blanking our minds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… the shop does take out." Gwen tapped the golden vestibule against Golos' electrum scales. "Eric. How long are we going to be here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That depends on the subject," Magister Rendfrey indicated to the quivering Sen-sen, quivering and ready to meet its maker. "And of course, the subject's master."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calamity, I shall not be denied this Chicken Tikka Masala you speak of—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen passed a smidgen of Void between her fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GAAAARGH—!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bosh! How the hell else am I going to get through your bloody diamond-armour?" Gwen tapped the vessel filling with dark, potent blood. "Look at the size of that neck of yours. That incision was a centimetre thick, tops. Your bleeding's already slowing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your wounds are most irksome." Golos nudged her again until Gwen almost lost her balance. "I demand recompense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's not too much trouble. I'll tell an Apprentice to bring up this Tandoori fellow," Magister Rendfrey volunteered. "It's no bother if Lord Golos desires it. Him being most accomodating and courteous. I'll pay, of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you insist, Magister." Gwen moved over to Walken's Mandala with the heavy jug of still-bubbling blood polluting the air with a stink of rust and iron. "Fair warning, Gogo eats just as much in his human form."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A humanoid morphic field! Astounding!" Magister Rendfrey rubbed his hands together. "Come! I shall give you my Apprentice's Message Glyph. Use Giles as you see fit. Magister Walken! Shall we?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken took possession of the austere vessel of dragon blood. On the levitation platform, a host of ingredients already churned within an automated ink-blender. When Gwen's eyes wandered over the interior, her Magister helpfully obliged. "Asphodel, Hippogriff's Bezoar, Lionfish Core, Eye of Ash Newt, Coral Pearl Dust, Fireseed, Ice-laced Rocksalt and ingot of True Silver— am I missing anything?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's all, Eric." Rendfrey applauded his fellow Magister. "It's a shame you've chosen not to take up alchemy proper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of Golo's blood prompted the keg of inscriptor-ink to simmer for a half-minute before the concoction settled. Though the smell was foul, the gathered could sense the palpable power of the blood-laced gloop swirling within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Magister Rendfrey thrice-confirmed the Mandala's every wand-stroke. "Miss Lindholm, if you would take your Spirits— both your Spirits, into the circle's midst, we may begin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yessir."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now. Are you &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; certain neither of your creatures will subsume the other? Don't say I didn't warn you," Rendfrey spoke as he coaxed the admixture from the pot with the length of carved yew that had been hanging by his side. Into the grooves of the base granite, the liquid seeped, lighting up with the silver-sheen of Conjuration as it touched the Mandala. "There's no crying over spilt milk if one— or both, perish as a result."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia's eyes widened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You got this," Gwen gave her healer an encouraging squeeze on the shoulder. She possessed absolute confidence her friend would succeed. "Golos is here to help as well. Sen-sen should prove no trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kiki!" The Alraune showed its determination by flexing its tendrils. "Kiki!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sen!" The Ginseng followed Elvia obediently into the middle of the Mandala, waddling as it went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alright!" Gwen finished inscribing the Message to Rendfrey's Apprentice. After today, her Evee would never be underestimated by the Mageocracy, or anyone, ever again. "Let's get this show on the road! Evee, your ascension is at hand!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia sat in the lotus stance, trying her best to relax both body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To her left rested her Alraune Spirit, waving gently against the invisible breeze. To her right, held captive within a triple-layer of Octogramic Warding, sat Sen-sen, staring at her with its eyeless face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Circle's powering up!" came a warning from her present and future partner. "Start probing Sen-sen with your mind! Reach out and try to envelop him with your Astral Body!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia closed her eyes and shut out all distractions. A healer's concentration was different from that of a Combat Mage. A Cleric's focus was inward-facing, generating an immutable sense of calm that drove away all unnecessary stimuli. Drawing upon that third-sense now, she sharped her insights until Sen-sen came into direct focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around her, the Mandala burned, igniting the Dragon Blood. &lt;br/&gt;Within the swirling world of conscious and the subconscious, Elvia's world imploded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bonding had begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sen-sen— come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physiology of an NoM, lacking the reactive motes of mana that made one's body near-transparent to the diagnostic magic of a healer, was a dull and uninspiring affair. Comparatively, a Mage's body, depending on their expertise, could appear as a well-lit network of conduits, beneath which she could see the vessels of the body ferrying forth the lifeblood from the central mana organs— the brain, the liver, the heart. Gwen's interior, when Elvia had sought to satiate a forbidden curiosity, was a whirling network of Lightning and Void, criss-crossed in every which way and yet running in perfect parallel. It shamed her that, in the Frontier, she had been flooding Gwen with raw Positive Energy to stimulate her body's healing potential. In those dark days, it was little wonder that they emerged from every battle utterly exhausted and craving the sweet embrace of slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Sen-sen, the stowed vitality crammed within the root's tiny body was akin to diving into a celestial cluster. Within, she needed to locate Sen-sen's Spirit, and with sufficient will, overpower the Ginseng's ego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeper and deeper she dived, headlong into the nebula until, from that strange, metaphysical firmament, she began to tumble, limbs akimbo, falling and falling without end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing panic took hold.&lt;br/&gt;Something was wrong. &lt;br/&gt;This was not at all what the Spellcraft theory had prescribed, nor what Gwen had foretold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AEEEEEE!" Lacking the means to fly, and missing her partner's guiding hand, Elvia's mind tumbled through the Astral world. "Gwennie!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Tyrtrol vur qe Meagea&lt;/em&gt;!" Golos spat forth a mouthful of volcanic Vindaloo. Draconic— with its forceful, plosive tones, wasn't exactly the best language for simultaneous speaking and eating. "&lt;em&gt;O-rigato dout Navnik Zhren&lt;/em&gt;!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spot of curry sizzled against the burning Mandala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's nose twitched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lord Magister," she quietly enquired of their hired aid. "Vindaloo doesn't impact the efficacy of Mandalas, does it? Elvia won't bond to curry, I hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I certainly hope not!" The Magister had taken one sniff at the oriental concoction, then backed away from the tubs of sludge-like spice. Adjusting the Arcane Eye embedded into his spectacles, he quickly confirmed his hypothesis. "Imagine the scandal. We would have the owners on stasis in a heartbeat! 'Tower' of Tandoori indeed!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Golos is certainly enthused…" Walken's voice took a tone of concern. His eyes glowed with the light from a Glyph-studded spectroscope. "Your Ally is feeding the Mandala— you know, usually, an expenditure of Essence comes at a drastic cost to the caster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good on Gogo for giving it his all." Gwen did her best via her Detect Magic. "Sen-sen might not have the brains, but it IS five centuries old and bred for Dragon-chow. Evee's just recently eighteen. I imagine there's quite the existential difference to be balanced out. Kiki as well is at least half a century old. What a rout, eh? I'd like to see her competitors bitch now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"True, and our Mandala is holding steady," Walken remarked. "You've tamed your pet Wyvern in ways we cannot begin to comprehend. In the future, you may wish to volunteer some of your methods with the Bestiary section of the Tower. The Griffin Tamers, in particular, have considerable trouble pinning down alpha specimens. Once the birds get a taste for human flesh..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken made a chopping motion with his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caliban— I mean— 'I' can be very charming..." Gwen had never clarified the precise particulars of how Golos came to fear her, nor would she share it. For one, her prideful Wyvern might rampage if Humans started giving him looks of pity. "There's not much to it. Golos is just a big ball of raging Draconic testosterone. He eats, shits and fucks. How hard can it be to satisfy that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All Dragons have hidden depth," Walken warned her. "No pool insufficiently deep can hold a Water Dragon, that's an oriental saying, I believe?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen looked over at Golos stuffing his face silly with naan and globs of curry, having the time of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll keep an eye out," she answered sceptically. "Say, do you know any Dungeons, parks or Wildlands hereabouts that's Planar Ally friendly?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHOOMP!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the displacing dust, Elvia found herself alone and atop a blasted building torn to smithereens by the force of a recently passed AoE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city below, a silhouette foreign to her memory, smouldered as though a rolling wave of coal-fired lava had erupted from the earth's core. Screams, thick as the steam, filled the air, joining the barrier sirens to form an unholy requiem of death and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What…" Elvia circulated as much mana through her conduits as she was able to muster, concurrently calling on Kiki and Sen-sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, her Spirits failed to make an appearance.&lt;br/&gt;Where could she be? Caught in an illusion? &lt;br/&gt;If so, which city now boiled below? &lt;br/&gt;Elvia focused on empowering her vision. There wasn't just fire; there was water as well. No city with skyscrapers and avenues like that should be so inundated by the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;SVA DRONG ANNYO!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, soul-piercing shriek resounded across the horizon. Elvia's gaze followed the howling gale to see a moving, shifting, quadruped silhouette roving through the oily, aubergine atmosphere. Rippling waves of black-red ash fell from the blue-dark like October snow, smothering the city with its suffocating gloom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Dragon?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A BLACK DRAGON? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her heart seized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calm Emotion!" Elvia weaved the subconscious Clerical sorcery through the air. The spell failed to manifest, though she did feel calmer for the placebo. Momentarily, the charcoal creature pierced through the cloud bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… Ariel?" There was no mistaking it. The stag horns, the stout body, the lion's claws and the rear hoofs she had molested so often, as well as the goldfish's fantail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Kirin. An ashen Kirin shrouded by malevolent vapours of Negative Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her body began to shiver. If that was Ariel, then where was Gwen? If that was Ariel, then what of Caliban?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She scanned the city below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presently, the milling mass of dark motes continued its onward march. There was an awful familiarity about it all, the way it flowed and ebbed, reached out with tendrils to test the distance, tasting the direction in which it spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undead!&lt;/em&gt; Elvia's mind was now in full revolt. Millions of Undead! A whole host of them— enough to swallow a capital!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was she in the midst of this horrid vision? &lt;br/&gt;Where's Sen-sen? &lt;br/&gt;"Gwen?" She called out. "Gwennie? Where are you? Lord Golos? Magister Walken?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Evee…" a voice answered her from behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia spun. &lt;br/&gt;When finally her mind caught up, her lips parted with incomprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"P-Percy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy— or perhaps she should say, a young man now, appeared wiser than his years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing here?" Elvia's head abruptly filled with conspiracy. What if, for example, she and Gwen and everyone had fallen under the Curse of a malignant Hag's nightmare. Or if there was a wide-scale terrorist attack on the Shard? "Where's Gwen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The great &lt;em&gt;Saviour Song&lt;/em&gt; is getting ready to deploy her Shoggoth," Percy's tone was churlish and provoking. Closer, the young man's salt-encrusted armour crumbled. With a grunt, he dispelled the upper layer, revealing a shrivelled body speckled with combat-damage. "Tianjin is gone, I am afraid. They're letting Gwen clean up. This time tomorrow, there'll only be a husk of a city left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's using her Shoggoth?!" Elvia gulped. "I need to get to her! Why am I here of all places? Why is there Undead here in Northern China?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percy appeared confused. "Don't worry— Lulan's with Gwen. Sis told us to wait for her here, at the Observatory, don't you remember? The city is overrun. The PLA is in full retreat. Beijing Tower's not coming. There are nine million souls down there ready to join the Undead Tide from Pyongyang. The Party won't let that happen, not with the Forbidden City a day away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jesus Christ." Elvia glanced at the carnage below. She could just make out pockets of fighting. A Squad of PLA Golems, burning blue with jets of exhaust, laid down lines of radiant fire into the avenues of the flaming city. Where the dark swarm retreated, a dozen tendrils emerged, each led by howling Wraiths and screeching Death Guards riding monstrous drake-steeds the size of semi-trailers. Behind the line of spluttering Golems, the city's fleeing defenders— an endless multitude of crying, churning civilians, scrambled over one another. "Percy, how did this happen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cult of Juche, how else? But enough questions— I am badly drained—" Percy stumbled forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without thinking overmuch, Elvia caught the young man in her arms. "Are you alright?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does it look like I am right?" Percy's cheeks appeared sallow, his eyes, now that the young man was closer, she could see that his eyes had the lustre of dead fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry. I'll heal you now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My gratitude is boundless." Percy placed a hand around her shoulder, using her body as support. "How's Richard? Did he make it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Richard? What happened to—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CRACK!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A booming roll of thunder snapped across the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the impenetrable dark clouds, a meteor rapidly fell, a white-scaled body clad in living lightning— though much diminished and missing one wing. Together with the tumbling mass of its sleek, elegant figure was a deluge of corrupted blood, carapace and spellfire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Lord Golos!" Elvia's eyes went wide. "Is— is GWEN there? Fighting?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ashen Kirin re-emerged in hot pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;JAKA, shio sia Irlymi Wharac sva sia KILITH!&lt;/em&gt;" Hearing the Kirin's croaking voice was like having claws scratching the inside of her skull. Her skin crawled. It almost sounded like the monstrous being was speaking in their general direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Axun, sva Drong Annyo&lt;/em&gt;," answered a voice an inch away from her neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia snapped her face around to see Percy's eyes grow suddenly cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, she couldn't breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am sorry, &lt;em&gt;Evee…"  &lt;/em&gt;The boy who was Gwen's brother gripped her neck with one hand, the other pressed against her abdomen. Unbidden, her mana, her vitality, all the warmth from her body drained away. Negative Energy hammered her brain, nullifying all thoughts into the consistency of soup, preventing her from conjuring of even the most rudimentary of spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GWEN! Elvia wanted to awake from the nightmare. The sensation, the pain, the fear, the soul-crushing feeling of life drain, none of it felt like an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… but it was a matter of time before Gwen finds out about Uncle Jun..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uuuuerrggk…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... and I think we both know Sis well enough to guess her mad dog antics..." Strangely, Percy's eyes were not focused on his victim, but the flickering, dark horizon, denying her the final dignity of having her murderer stare her down. Acutely, she felt her flesh turning to crystalline salt. The agony, in a clinical sense, was beyond the sensory limit of her nervous systems. "So this isn't anything personal. If anything, I'd call it self-preservation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflected in Percy's eyes, Elvia saw a great tendril descend from the churning heavens. It was the Shoggoth, and it had arrived to undo all the follies of man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GODS! This can't be real! None of this is real!&lt;/em&gt; An internal voice howled in desperation. &lt;em&gt;By the Nazarene! WAKE UP!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her eyes snapped open. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was light, and once her pupils adjusted, she saw rock formations bustling with pine trees that grew like sinuous serpents—all around her, cloud banks and rolling seas of mist cascaded down calico granite cliffs. From the burning city, she was now floating listlessly through a stone mirage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She raised her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amongst the vague, mystical mountains, a mutton-jade rise pierced the heavens, shrouded in toiling cumulonimbus, cracking with blue-white lightning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her heart ballooned until it was on the verge of bursting. Was this the domain of Almudj? The fabled Unformed Land? The air here was different— the atmosphere was so thick with mana that she felt it permeate her mortal lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clouds parted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A singular eye— cobalt and emerald and enormous beyond all comprehension, appeared and disappeared into the uncertain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GWEN!" Elvia called out, her spine growing rigid with alarm. There was no way this was Almudj. Here was a whole other Mythic, the one from Gwen's stories, one with whom she should have no discernible business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thou art at a crossroads, companion of the Calamity..." a great, booming voice toiled in the recess of her head, filling her skull with its presence. Her host was enormous, stretching from peak to peak, coiled about the landscape as a roaring river. "Little Ginseng, O seed of ruin, thou shall choose which grain shall grow, and which shall wilt and rot..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mandala sizzled out.&lt;br/&gt;Within the confines of her Divination-infused vision, Elvia's mana presence doubled— perhaps tripled in intensity. It wasn't so much a matter of volume, as per Gwen herself, but density and purity. For a mid-tier Spirit and a mundane Conjurer, a significant boost in Affinity was expected. In Elvia's case, her transformation was transcendent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How is it?" Gwen turned to her betters for an answer, her basic knowledge insufficient to offset her anxiousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No need to fret. I believe we have achieved our goal." Magister Rendfrey clapped his hands happily. "Most importantly, without incident! Without even a single contingency Glyph tripped! My word, Magus Song, are you certain your companion doesn't have a little mystical Essence in her?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe she does. Evee's special," Gwen smugly replied, relieved that Almudj has Evee in her sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No doubt. No doubt." Rendfrey nodded without refrain. "The diagnostics from our venture should serve the Tower well, I think. Dual-Spirits! And using only a Seventh-Circle Mandala following a classical Margulis-Gessner cross-modulation! I just knew the Dragon Blood would do the trick. Ah, but do not let me detain you— here comes our future saintess!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the dissolving circle, Elvia emerged from the cascading sheets of silvery Conjuration, her complexion as pale and oily as lambswool. The girl was soaked in sweat, her blouse diaphanous enough for Gwen to materialise a towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Evee!" Gwen approached without hesitation. "My God! You must be exhausted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am alright." Elvia raised a dainty, trembling hand. "Gwennie, look at what I've got— Sen-sen!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her healer squeezed the Ginseng in her arms.&lt;br/&gt;The Cleric's cheeks flushed crimson. &lt;br/&gt;The air around Elvia shimmered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SEN!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's body froze, not just at the sight of Elvia looking so radiant, but out of bone-deep, primal instincts ingrained into the genes of her ancestors. Walken as well, stiffened and grew pale, while the jubilant Magister Rendfrey sunk to his knees and whimpered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… Oops," her healer quickly relented. "That's enough, Sen-sen. Sorry everyone, I am not sure how to use him yet. Gwen is going to have to coach me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sen!" Sen-sen attempted to wiggle out of Elvia's arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kiki!" Her Alraune slapped the Ginseng across the mid-section. "Kiki!" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Sen-sen..." Sen-sen quailed before the bulbous floral Sprite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen waited for her jaws to re-hinge, forcing through Almudj's Essence so that ligament by ligament, her muscles warmed up. Next, it took all her courage to make her next enquiry. "Evee… is that— Dragon Fear? What the hell did you do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a subtle gesture, her healer released her root vegetable from the Material Plane. After a final, relieved "Sen!", the Ginseng disappeared into its newly-formed pocket dimension. When Elvia gazed back, Gwen's healer appeared taller somehow, more dignified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You said you would make me special." Elvia's blushing face was such a juxtaposition against the sphincter-crunching horror Gwen had just endured that she suffered from whiplash. "Now— I am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen licked her lips, her tongue parched, her mind tabula rasa. Gods, Evee was beautiful— and terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you... not pleased?" Elvia cocked her head. "But..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several seconds, the silence in the room grew thick enough to be sliced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hahaha…" Golos' abrupt, interrupting laughter crowded the room like the stink of a suffocating, Draconic-curry fart. "So you've chosen. Well done, &lt;em&gt;Moxt Myvish&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's brows furrowed as her Translation Stone performed its terrible divination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Little… S-sister?" She spun around toward Golos. &lt;br/&gt;She knew it! She just knew it was too good to be true! &lt;br/&gt;Gogo, an accommodating, considerate drake? &lt;br/&gt;There was no such thing as a free lunch! &lt;br/&gt;Fucking Golos, helping out, making Sen-sen obey! &lt;br/&gt;She couldn't possibly be angry at Evee, so all she could do was steer the freight train of her anger elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GOGO! EXPLAIN YOURSELF! OR I SWEAR TO EVEE, &lt;em&gt;YOU'LL BE EATING CURRY OUT OF A TUBE!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">496652</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 10:53:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 346 - Bride and Groom</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/494392</link><description>&lt;div&gt;Despite the aborted divorce, Walken's wife did not appear nearly as convinced as Angie of Gwen's presumed innocence. Instead, Audrey's reprieve would depend on the delivery of a panacea for Angie. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I'll arrange it right now." Her future executive officer had wasted no time. "First, tell me all of your current contacts in London..." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;True to form, the old snake's knack for dropping names at precisely the right intervals worked wonders. After an hour of interrogating Gwen's numerous overreaches and over-achievements, instances of "Lady Grey", "The Mistress of Cliveden", "Our new Dwarven Allies", and "I would not want to waste Duke Mycroft's time either," peppered the Magister's vernacular.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She needed time to think, and Walken had unconsciously done her a favour by exhausting the afternoon pulling every favour to schedule Sen-sen's ritual as soon as possible. In addition to procuring materials, he would also personally inscribe the Mandala, as well as spend CCs to contract an assistant upper-tier Enchanter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was a pleasure, in a way, watching Walken work, even if his care for Angie did leave a bittersweet saltiness in her mouth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beside her, Elvia remained shut as a catatonic clam, likewise needing time. Whenever Gwen tapped the healer's shoulders, touched her shins, or called her name, the girl only answered in single syllables.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For Gwen, the lack of response only multiplied her silent distress. Even now, the petals of her lips burned with the heat of a thousand suns; though she tried NOT to think about the sweet kiss planted by her willing Evee, the sensation invariably lingered. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I'll join you on the Isle of Dogs mid-January," Walken explained, finally exhausting every topic of conversation. "We'll be attending the IIUC ceremony together." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Will it be in London?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"The venue depends on the victor. If Oxbridge takes the crown as per usual, then you'll receive your scroll at home. If not, you can choose to go to Cambridge, or exercise a private ceremony at Peterhouse." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"The one in Massachusetts?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Walken nodded. "I think it should come as no surprise that your friends from Pretoria failed to outperform the previous champions. Did you get a chance to watch the December match?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"No, not at all. How about you, Evee?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Cleric's chrysalis remained impregnable.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;".... A shame. Jean-Paul did well. Nothing compared to a certain sorceress' metrics in Shenyang, of course, but he's made a name for himself. The lad from House Hertzog as well has received invitations to engage in post-graduate studies here in England. They both have an interest in you and, though I am overstepping my boundaries, let me say Meister Bekker's influence transcends Factions and borders." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To further distract herself, Gwen recalled the cringe-worthy invitation from Jean-Paul, smothering the smouldering coals stoked by Evee.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Is Jean-Paul back in London?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I doubt it," Walken said. "Its spring right now in Pretoria." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"True." Gwen redirected her thoughts toward the jacarandas and flame trees studding Sydney's southern suburbs. Her advisor was right. Her fellow Void user did profess that he and his Master escaped the winter every year in South Africa. Given time and resources, she too would one day ascend the ranks of migratory globe-trotters. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The two rested their teacups. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"... Miss Song, are you staying for supper?" Angie appeared at the kitchen door. "Mum said you're welcome." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And with that, her hardwon time delay came to an end. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the teas and ices, the crisis had climaxed. Within her beaten body, the surviving motes of emotional awareness that had outlived Helena and Hai cried out for redress. Whether weal or woe, Elvia's courage deserved an answer. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And for that, they needed privacy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Luckily, they were in the right town. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On Brighton's foreshore, there was an old observational outpost, an enormous pin-shaped tower that commanded a three-sixty degree view of the township. A simple call from Walken citing a Class VI War Mage's desire was enough to warrant unfettered access to the decommissioned war relic. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And that was why, ten minutes later, with Elvia cradled in her arms, the duo arrived a-hundred-and-sixty meters above sea-level into the curved-glass capsule, overlooking the bayside town of Brighton.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="48" src="https://imgur.com/Ys9pKEb.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="235"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Kiki!" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Sen!" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Shaa-shaa!" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Ee—EE!" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia had long since learned to observe Gwen by observing her Familiars. Near the ceiling of the semi-doughnut dome of the observatory, Ariel hovered listlessly, agitated by alien emotions it could not process. Below the Kirin, its sibling writhed, an eel on a hotplate, drooling goo like a dying hagfish. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not far, her Alraune Spirit was in full bloom, feeding off her burgeoning desires, dripping with the scent of lilies. Besides her, Gwen sat as shy as a rain-teased bud, swaying softly in the honeyed light from the bay below. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia circulated a calming surge of Positive Energy to ease her nerves. What should happen next, she knew all too well. In her occasional daydreams, when she dared to have them, she had already imagined every nook and cranny of her friend against her own, perfectly fitted as if devised by nature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In Blackwattle, mid-adolescence, her delusions had been vague and fuzzy, full of ambiguity and fantasy. Now, as a provisional practitioner of reproductive health and magically-assisted midwifery, no imagination was needed. Though she lacked practical experience, Elvia understood the physiology of pleasure in an academic context. Though best practices varied, she knew what to stoke and coax. Why, with a little help from diagnostic magic, she would take Caliban's best consumption for a run—&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And then the delusion ended, and the root of Elvia's slender neck grew flamingo-pink. From the corner of her eye, she spied at her muted friend, wrapped up in deliriums of her own. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A passive Gwen was lovely as well. Elvia loved the way the dying light turned her eyes amber. She loved the elegance of Gwen's neck, the fall of her hair about her shoulders, her pale skin against the dark fabric of her dress.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When would an answer be forthcoming?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Between her abdomen and her diaphragm, two Sen-sens jostled for space. In the chamber of her heart, an effervescent Kiki danced.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia blinked, realising she had been caught in yet another private revelry. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beside her, sitting pretty, Gwen had never appeared more beautiful, more within reach. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Gwen…" she reached out. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There was no more patience to waste. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fruit of the temporal was ripe for the picking.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="48" src="https://imgur.com/Ys9pKEb.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="235"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the self-reared Gwen growing up in Newtown, the path of love proved only marginally less torturous than midday dramas. To pay her way through university, she had worked popular dives, which put her in the vicinity of unique opportunities. More than once, she had frightened off disappointing father figures who skipped town when the crazy out-stripped the fun. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By the second year of university, she had grown tired of catfights, fistfights and the company of sympathetic cops escorting belligerent lovers from boarding houses. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vowing to better herself, she turned to the voracious consumption of literature, living the lives of fictional women to supplement her loneliness. It was there, in the library, in the first chapter of a vintage romance novel, that she met Clarissa, an Austen-reading, Woolf-quoting, Plath-citing bibliophile. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For six-month, Gwen had done her best to keep her spectres bottled, and for a while, life was stable and fulfilling, thanks in no small way to her mild-mannered lover's incredible endurance. After that, old habits surfaced, grinding her companion down to the stump until she too could no longer endure Gwen's unpredictable mood-swings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In hindsight, the juxtaposing six months of happiness were a rare poison. The fallout from that particular breakup had bordered on the burlesque, almost derailing Gwen's tertiary education.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What she learned from the episode, once professional advice had been sought, was that lacking the aid of Dr Monroe's one-fifty-an-hour clarity, she struggled to understand, much less balance, the intimacy, insecurity, support, challenge and celebrations that came with "healthy relationships". &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I think we should keep exploring the episode with Clarissa." Dr Siobhan Monroe's empathy was boundless when she finally coaxed the tale from Gwen. "That said, are you keeping up with the Celexa? How's your appetite?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And therein, Gwen self-diagnosed, lied the crux of her agitation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It wasn't so much that she wasn't "Gwen". That was a moot point since Elvia had never known the original. Rather— she couldn't get over the cradle-robbing reality of their difference in maturity. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Perhaps it was a symptom of growing up in the '90s, an era where the prurient paedophilia performed by the local Church perverted the public conscience, popularising the notion of "grooming". &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sure, under her guiding hand, Elvia could live in a golden palace. But the imbalance of control she would exert over her doll-like lover turned her stomach. She required Elvia to be herself, to live her own life and attain her dreams as she would. She wanted Elvia to be happy, upset, angry, indignant, all of her own accord.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But Hai and Helena had only taught her that love was usurpation; that Caliban was Love's patron saint. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Conversely, her affection for Elvia had its origins in sisterhood, in friendship, in oxytocin incited by small blonde things soft to the touch and snug as a warm pillow. To say that there was something more, to pass that particular threshold, required a re-arrangement of mental and physical faculties beyond the pale. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And her self-chastisement wasn't even the beginning of their problems. Say she cast aside the metaphysical age difference between herself and Evee—how would their meritocratic society gaze upon the loss of not one, but two unique sorceresses? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Soon, Elvia would become a twin-Spirited Cleric with unlimited potential. As for herself, she could strip a city down to the bones and not even need to change out of her dress.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Evee had the privilege of naivety, but she had tasted the bitter fruit of societal pressure all her life. Before she could raze a village, her beauty had been a burden, something to be prodded and molested, or upheld on a pedestal. Now, that very power which freed her acted as her chains. If she denied the Mageocracy its dearest wish, as her Master had once foreshadowed, as JP's Meister now so desired, what would become of them?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a Weapon of Mass Destruction with a womb, were her life choices truly hers alone? What would Gunther say? Or Babulya? Or Opa, or her Yeye or Uncle Jun? From Sydney to China to London, there was no doubt that the availability of her body, to put matters crudely, had opened doors. As one old enough to understand consequences beyond overt sentimentality and hormonal longing, she shuddered at the catastrophic cost of forsaking potential. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And wasn't Elvia a staunch Christian? Or at least a devoted practitioner of the Faith? The Evee she knew always said her prayers, gave her alms, knew her psalms and attended Mass. What would happen to her Faith Magic if she lived in existential sin? How would the hospital, the state, the Shard, Evee's sponsors, overlook an asset the likes of which they may never see again? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For now, love was blindness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But success, their future success, required sacrifices. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And say they overcame all of that, Gwen licked her parched lips.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Could she abandon her cloud-capped Tower and the ambitions left by her beloved Master? What about Sobel? Could she leave that behind? She was a one-woman army, but she was no longer one-woman, not anymore. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Gwen…" Elvia's longing resounded as though filtered through a dream. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Their gazes entwined. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Evee." She swallowed, fighting to keep her voice from trembling. "Quite the display you put on at Walken's." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;NO! Her brain almost threw up. That's not what she meant to say, not what she meant all! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I did it for you." Elvia sidled closer, her limbs parasitic vines curling about Gwen's princely trunk. In the next moment, her healer's breath was hot against her collarbone. "I swear by my Astral Soul, Gwennie, I—" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I know," Gwen interjected. To prevent any immediate misunderstanding, she gave Elvia a peck on the forehead, deftly re-zipping the side-slit of her dress. "Let's slow down a bit, shall we? I want to ask you some questions, Evee, and we'll need all our wits about us." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The vague fingers withdrew. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There was confusion and hurt, Gwen felt it acutely, but there was no helping it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"When did you know?" Gwen wrapped her fingers around Elvia's dainty digits. The girl's hands were tender and warm and trembling.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Since Sydney." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"When did you start to like girls, I mean." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia's face grew evermore scarlet. There was a pause before the girl began to speak. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I am sorry, I lied to you and Yue." Her figure appeared to shrink.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gwen blinked, derailed by Elvia's train of thought. "How so?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I told you both that I was afraid of the arranged marriages set up at Lilith's," the Cleric confessed. "And that's why I transferred to a government school, where no one would know me, or care to find out." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Oh…" Gwen was intrigued. Elvia was indeed an oddball at Blackwattle. Her talent, her wealth, her demeanour, all of it juxtaposed the academy's working-class cohort.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Her healer squirmed in her arms. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I had to leave because one of the sisters found out." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"About your… disposition?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Evee nodded. "I didn't know what I was doing then. One of the older girls I was fond of took me behind the chapel, to a shrine in the cloisters…" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Oh my…" Gwen felt her cheeks heating up. "And then?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Then nothing," Elvia quickly clarified. "We danced... and kissed, that's all." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Like a peck? On the lips?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"No..." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"How did it feel?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"It was... the most exquisite thing. I couldn't think at all. One minute we were practising for the formal, then the world was on fire. All I remember was Matron Mavis screaming, that and St Peter's disapproving face looking down from the altar."  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gwen felt her palpable jealousy prick like a malicious pin.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Did you tongue-wrestle?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"GWENNIE!" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Hahaha…" The built-up tension fell from her shoulders together with the rolling laughter. Finally, she could breathe again. "Alright, that was my bad. So the Sister found out, and then?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"She called my parents and the girl's parents. Mine was nicer. Less fire and brimstone, but the senior girl's parents were livid. They accused me of seducing their daughter, who was Awakened and engaged to marry. They were from the North Shore proper, not immigrants like us, so we couldn't do anything other than accept their accusation at face value." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Bastards…" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"In the end, Daddy appeased them by offering to move me out of school so that we would never meet again. I stayed home for a term, moping and crying while my mother comforted me. She said that everything would be alright." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"And was it?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"It was." Elvia's lips were wet with happiness. "I met Yue— and I met you." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I am glad you came to Blackwattle as well." Gwen offered her Cleric another affirmation, this time on the hands. The fascinating flashback recollected by her healer had finally dispelled all doubt from her mind. "Okay, I've made up my mind. Care to listen?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia nodded. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Right. Here goes." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gwen took a deep breath. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Evee, I do share your feelings." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia squealed, her voice child-like and full of glee, further cementing Gwen's determination. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"But—" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Instantly, the girl settled. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"— Love is never easy. It's complicated, messy, and deceptive. It's not black and white, give and take. Some of us— like you, have so much to give, while others like me— tend to take and take." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; "I don't—" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I know you don't care if the balance is tilted. That's too like you." Gwen continued. "And yes, that's what it means to be in love. I don't intend to patronise or condescend, Elvia, but whatever I say to you now, you're not going to empathise, not holistically, at least." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"What do you mean?" Elvia's nervousness was palpable. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I can only speak for myself," Gwen spoke up. "And speaking for myself, I am not a suitable partner." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"No!"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Let me finish," Gwen silenced her Evee with an all-too-serious flash of her amber eyes. "I didn't say I wouldn't make a wonderful companion, a loyal mate, an incredible business associate, a constant sister or a zealous devotee—" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia ceased her struggles. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Rather— I was raised by Helena and Hai, remember? Right fucking paragons of partnership and parenthood. For a long while, I knew only how to appease others. Then for a longer-while, I learned only to please myself. Even now, what I want from you is completely one-sided." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I can…" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"But not like that, not yet." Gwen arrested Elvia's fingers a little more tightly in case her resolve grew ill. "But that's what I mean. Love isn't simple. It's a network of conflicting interests that, without venturing into the wider world, you can't begin to comprehend. I love you, Evee— as a friend, a sister, a party member, and so much more, but let me say this, and you're not going to like it—" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia's eyes turned liquid. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Before she could continue, Gwen knew she had to fortify her life-long companion for what was to come. Evee's gentleness, depthless when needed, was also as fragile as crystal. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Answering her healer, she leaned in until their face was an inch apart. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Greedily, Elvia met her halfway, wrapping the small of her arm around the crook of Gwen's neck so that she could no longer pull back. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then for a long, lingering while, with Brighton's brimming channel shimmering below them, they stayed entwined and interlocked, a pale-skinned glory against a mortal Ledean body, enacting the yolk and white of the one shell. She was breathing through Evee, and Evee through herself, connected by a consciousness older than the oldest of continents. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In time, the pair parted— a viridescent spider-thread appearing and disappearing between them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"What were you saying?" Elvia slurred, drunk on the milk of paradise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Evee." Gwen forced her tremulous voice to remain perfectly level, her brimming emotions a careful meniscus of constrained passion. "We're going to have to take things slow. Very slow."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I don't understand." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"You will, in a decade or two," she pulled them apart, tearing Elvia from her as one might coax an octopus clinging to the coral. "For now, I want us to remain the best of friends. Closer than friends, but not quite lovers, not yet." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; "Why?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"For one, there's no gay marriage here or there or anywhere, unless Hanmoul's expecting to blow my mind when we get to Deepholm." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To her surprise, Elvia's confusion multiplied. "Why would we get married? We're both girls." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gwen performed a double-take.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"… Good point, I'll get back to you on that one." She realised she might have to pull back, not just to the '80s, but possibly revisit the '50s. "Don't you want to have children, Evee? I know you've got a brother, but your parents are the most loving, caring people I've ever met. Wouldn't they be disappointed? After your ejection from Lilith, weren't they upset?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Mum..." Elvia's tone lost some of its enthusiasm. "Mum and Dad were both very kind, but yes, they were shocked." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"And did you stop to think whether I would want children?" Gwen struck while the fire was hot.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"No…" Evee's voice grew fainter still.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"NOT that I do, so don't fret! On the off-chance, we could adopt, of course, save a soul, or two, or a dozen from destitution and ruin," Gwen assured her little Evee. "Our children need not even be human— Golos would make a good candidate for a little gopher."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"… that's terrible! I would prefer my Kiki." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Ha! They'll make quite the pair at the local kindergarten." Gwen relaxed her guard. For someone with her limited capacity for non-manipulative empathy, trying to seesaw between passion and prudence was no easy feat. "And what if this is just a phase, Evee? The seasons change, as do lovers. Lest we transcend the shackles of time, nothing's immutable." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I won't change." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Nor do I want you to," Gwen sighed. "But you're— we're still YOUNG. Gods, Evee, we're a bunch of babies! Relatively speaking, we're infants! According to Golos, I'd be still kicking around in my third or fourth century, and that's before I had met Almudj again, or ate more Dragons." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elvia's eyes misted over. For a girl of eighteen, a century was unimaginable. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I mean, holy crap Evee. Fancy that! In a hundred years, humanity went from buffalo farming to a globe-spanning system of Towers connected by Teleportation Stations! Can you imagine what things would be like two-centuries from now? Would we be in space? Will we jaunt across the aether and colonise the Planes of Fire and Radiance? Drink coffee in Deepholm? Mine the red soil of Mars courtesy of Meister Musk?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Who's Musk?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"What I mean," Gwen backpedalled from her digression. "Is that there's no rush. For now, if you're content with my devotion, then leave us enough space to catch our breath." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"… and if I am not?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gwen paused. Sometimes, she hated the fact that she had all the right lines. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long. I don't want that for us, Evee. A millennium without you? What a terrible aeon that would be. I would prefer the extinction of our world." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Her prophesy lingered in the air, keeping company with the redolence spread by a simpering Kiki perfuming the interior of the observatory. Beside the flower Sprite, Sen-sen approached the observatory's precipice, only to shrink back with an alarmed "Sen!" before retreating to the stairs. Ariel lingered near the ceiling, feeding off the nascent emotions rolling through their Empathic Link. A calmer Caliban coiled under the chair, purring softly at the twin-morsel. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As per the mutability of England's weather, the once burning sky turned rapidly overcast, mauve and under-lit against the crumbling silhouette of the Shielding Station's constant shimmer. The town itself remained fruit-shop bright, gregarious in its faux-summer hues; across the painted English Channel, Gwen saw the marina's yachts returning from their hunt. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Like goose-down they were, erect and upright, bobbing in a crow-black sea, mariners of the aubergine murk, cubism hovering on air. As the light died, the mulberry horizon lost its dimensions, becoming as dull as bleached chiffon. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Gwen?" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Yes, Evee?" Gwen held her breath.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"At the very least, can I kiss you now and then?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Her hesitation lasted only a second.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fear of loneliness made for a potent aphrodisiac.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Down below, one by one, the unfurled quills came home as a line, each a white-winged sister from Nightingale's, idly awaiting their turn in the confessional.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">494392</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 09:35:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 345 - Past the Shallows</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/492689</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In Gwen's impressionable adolescence, there had been mandatory Christian-study in place of actual counsellors. Post Thatcher, Australia, like most liberal economies, had embraced a new wave of bible-thumping the likes of which had not been seen since the '50s. It was the zeitgeist of a conservative right-wing boom aghast at the freedoms offered by the rock' n' rolling '80s, a riposte against the rise of alt-pop, hiked-skirts and the modern woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pastor, plagued by gaggles of giggling school girls, gave up discipline within the hour and opted for the fire and fury of hell to inspire virginity for Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen, being the tallest, prettiest poppy of the lot, would be singled out more than once to endure such a sermon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Whore of Babylon was often the topic of such an episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Mother of Prostitutes! Abominations of the Earth! She with whom all the kings of the earth have committed fornication!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pastor, recently divorced as per the spirit of the wanton age, would exhaust himself in bumbling ecstasy, his wandering eye regularly resting on the Eurasian in their midst. Thankfully, it was the age, and not something more sinister. Only recently had the "Gooks" made headlines as kingpins of heroine and the "Chinks" fled Tiananmen en-mass to Sydney's shores, allowing, "the bloody Wogs" a relieving breath of unmolested air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same words emerged from the perfectly formed face of Angie, Gwen had to fight off the stunned donning of an all too disturbing mantle. It made no sense. In this life, her pastor would have wept like a child at her prudence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was Walken's daughter daft?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen knew she wasn't a "whore", not by any metric. Naturally, she understood the biblical implication; the school chaplain had called his whore wife nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly, she glanced at Elvia, who appeared equally slack-jawed and wide-eyed, completely lacking in understanding. Evee had once remarked that a puss at work had labelled her with the title, though Gwen had yet to get around to skin that particular cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am sorry?" Gwen opted for diplomacy, choosing to understand that there might be a misunderstanding. "Young lady…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GWEN? You're here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The familiar face of Eric Walken, ex-member of the council of ten of Oceania, appeared in the corridor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eric!" Gwen waved. "Yes, I am here. Why wouldn't I be?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angie's face fell once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, dear…" Walken stopped in his tracks. To Gwen's eyes, her old nemesis-turned-ally looked quite a bit different from his Machiavellian self. In Sydney, Walken had been the aloof politician. In China, he had persisted in the air of a prideful English Magister, always appearing a rung above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with his gold-rimmed spectacles, scruffy beard and apron, the Magister appeared emasculated. There was now an unmistakable air of domesticity to the older man that made Gwen doubt her eyes. She rather fancied the newly mellowed Walken, even though he was so divorced from the Mage she had imagined him to be. "… I think you better come inside first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her father's amicability, Angie was not having it. "Dad, are you serious?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Possum, don't be rude to our guest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MOTHER!" The girl fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen and Walken looked at one another eye-to-eye. &lt;br/&gt;Walken looked tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VOOMP!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Dimension Door appeared and disappeared, revealing who could only be Audrey, Eric's wife. In between the fading motes of icy Conjuration, Gwen spied a dark-haired woman with the likeness of a lark. At first impression, the wife of Walken seemed sweet and sincere. She was short, as per her bird-like guise, with a narrow body, a small face and teak eyes. She dressed well in a full-length cotton-skirt and a pale-blue cashmere cardigan, certainly better than her aproned husband, carrying a demeanour that was dignified and portrait-ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You must be the delightfully unattached Miss Song." Audrey's voice, like her appearance, was sharp and controlled. "Do come into the kitchen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Audrey," Walken raised his voice. "This is most improper. Gwen's a guest and an important one at that. Show her to the living room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen involuntarily gulped when Walken's wife swept the gathering with her matronly gaze. Having enjoyed no experience of domesticity of any kind across two lives outside of compelling Percy to cook, she felt genuinely lost for words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the kitchen," the wife insisted. "Angie, you may make our guests some tea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter stomped away, as did Audrey, leaving Gwen standing in the corridor, watched by a confused Elvia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How's London?" Walken said awkwardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not the catch up I expected," Gwen replied to the unspoken question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mmm." Walken sighed. "I had wanted to prevent an incident, but now that you're here, maybe you can help us resolve our differences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country kitchen inside the townhouse was larger than Gwen had expected from the outside. Since the family occupied all three levels, the back porch had been knocked out and extended to the exterior, creating an oblong, half-dome winter garden. Around the kitchen table, the family sat for the impending presentation of their father's head on a silver platter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My apologies for Angie," Audrey began, her lips thin and severe. "Angie. Apologise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry, Miss Song." Angie inclined her chin. To Gwen, the girl looked to be in her late teens or very early twenties. Like her father, her keen features made her appear maturer than her years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's fine." Gwen hand-waved the prior insult. It wasn't as though she could extract satisfaction from Walken's family, so the apology was a moot point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audrey began the proceedings with a nod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To formalise our introduction, my name is Audrey Walken— of House Coke of Leicester, Norfolk. The late Earl Thomas Coke was my father. I am his surviving daughter. You've met my second, Andrey Coke-Walken, currently studying at London Imperial. Our eldest, Beatrix, is presently a Magus serving in Edinburgh. Finally, as you well know, Eric is currently unemployed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen Song, provisional Magus, Peterhouse, Cambridge and Class VI War Mage," Gwen answered stiffly, matching the woman's terseness. "My companion is Elvia Lindholm, a provisional practitioner of GOS and Nightingales. Also, your husband isn't unemployed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?" Audrey spooned a sugar cube into a steaming cup of English Breakfast. "Do tell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He will very soon be working as an Executive Officer on several operations involving the Isle of Dogs and an infrastructure project for the rest of London."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Working 'under' you, I presume?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are correct." Gwen left her tea untouched. From the wife's tone and the way Walken clenched his teeth, she was beginning to put two and two together. "Audrey, I am sensing a great deal of uninvited hostility. Your husband is correct in claiming that there has been a misunderstanding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very well." Audrey pursed her lips. "I am not unreasonable. Enlighten us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eric?" Gwen turned to Walken. "Care to clarify the problem?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken cleared his throat. "The fault is mine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Naturally—" Audrey stirred the tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen agreed, as did Angie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...After our unfortunate incident in Sydney." Walken's face took on an uncharacteristic hue. Gwen had never seen the man so flustered, not even in front of a Lich. "I er… never quite communicated to Audrey the extent of the trouble I was in, what with the exile from Sydney and all..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… fuck me." Gwen winced. "Eric. REALLY?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside her, the well-informed Elvia gasped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen now understood the source of Walken's humility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A temporary affair. As you know, I was repairing the damage from the fallout, and indeed, good progress has been made."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"True." Gwen nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What progress? From a regional administrator to unemployment?" Audrey chided her husband with her icy eyes. "That's progress, is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken waited for his wife to stop interjecting. "At any rate, for amply good reasons, I was off the grid while in China— the family was still provisioned materially, of course. Unfortunately, the trouble here began when they broadcasted the IIUC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You didn't realise they would show your face?" Gwen cocked her head. "You were our team advisor. You knew the Proctors by name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had made a request," Walken answered. "We had been right as rain up until the incident with the Lich. It's hard to avoid the vid-casts when one's nearly deceased."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah…" Realisation dawned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Daddy risked his life for you!" Angie could no longer hold her tongue. "He wasn't home often, but he always came back! Now, because of you, Daddy disappeared for almost a year! We haven't heard a peep from him since the Fall of Sydney, and when we see him again, he's on the vid-cast with you wrapped around his neck! Who are you to him anyway? Why would he do that for you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzle pieces clicked into place. Already, Gwen felt irked by the drama. She needed Walken up and running on the Isle of Dogs, not dealing with trivial domestic disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Angie, manners," Audrey quietened her daughter. Turning to face Gwen, the older woman's face was the picture of judgement. "I don't know how your folk do things in Australia, but we Brits hold certain ceremonies as sacred. The facade of matrimony must be upheld on the highest pedestal. In private, if Eric wishes to seek the warm and inviting company of a young sorceress such as yourself, then I have only my lack of allure to blame. However, what you have done to our reputation as a household is irreparable. Beatrix has already received many a mocking remark, and Angie here can barely keep her head held high. I, myself, as the chief victim of his affair, should consider myself lucky that I have sympathetic companions and friends in high places. What I ask from you then, is merely the impoverished gift of truth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen opened her mouth wide enough to fit two boiled eggs. &lt;br/&gt;What. The. Fuck. &lt;br/&gt;Walken's wife was suspecting she and old man Walken were bumping uglies because the old dog had neglected to churned her butter? The very thought of herself and Walken as non-platonic professionals made her drier than a slab of biltong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to Eric, you're simply a stepping stone back to where he should be," Audrey continued, her words making Walken squirm like a cheap steak on a sizzle-plate. "He expects us to believe him. Of course, I want to, but the evidence is difficult to swallow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What evidence?" Gwen demanded, her tone growing churlish. Being labelled a biblical destroyer and being accused of being a homewrecker were wholly different tiers of insults. What evidence did Audry possess? Was the woman going to show her a vid-cast of Instructor Walken teaching horizontal Spellcraft?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're easily worth the candle; I'll give you that." Audrey's eyes spoke volumes of what the wife thought of her attire, particularly the breathability offered by the autumn fabric. "Not that I don't trust Eric's temperance— rather— I know him too well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen shot Walken a wilting glare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken's wife lowered her teacup until it clinked. Turning to her husband, she cooly continued. "I don't think, if it came to it, that you would die for me, Eric. Maybe for the girls, but not for me. You've always been an absent father and inattentive husband, but I always believed in your adherence to the gentleman's code. Now, you've another significant other— Miss Song here, which begs the question. What should your wife think, Magister Walken, when her husband is willing to give his all, NOT to his daughters, whom you've left here in London: Beatrix in that godforsaken Frontier; Angie with her asthma; nor to his loyal spouse— but to Miss Song?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're missing the point," Walken appeared blindsided by his wife's audacity. "I've explained everything! More than once! Gwen's not like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like what? I somehow doubt this teenager is supplying you with the power and influence you crave. What she can offer, and what you may give; is self-evident." Audrey delivered her verdict. "So that leaves us with a natural conclusion. Ergo, Eric— I want a divorce."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silently, Gwen mouthed the words, "Holy shit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Divorce? DIVORCE?" Walken's Adam's apple bobbed like a buoy at noontide. "Christ, Audrey…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's only fair if you can't even pretend to play the faithful husband. At first, I had my doubts. Then I saw her kiss you— or revive you— or so you say, on the vid-cast, broadcasted across every respectable home in London and beyond. Still, I reserved my judgement, pushed my boundaries of belief, until the truth came out. We've all read the tabloids. Gwen Song, Void Sorceress, the maybe daughter of Mycroft Ravenport— your old patron and Factional chum. That was the final straw, Eric. Now I know why you did what you did— though I can't fathom why she could bear reciprocating the advances of an ageing, greasy eel. The mystery's gone, Eric. To the air, be free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rubbish!" Walken's face blushed scarlet. "Why do you think I was away all the time? Why was I alongside Gwen in the IIUC? I was WORKING! Working to ensure that one day, we would be influential again. That one day, the girls could return to Holkham Hall!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Never mind the ancestral estate, Eric. That's not your business, not anymore. We wouldn't dare take up any more of your time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken appeared to fight his hypertension with every mote of mana remaining in his unemployed body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HOLD UP." Gwen raised her voice. She had seen enough. A few clarifying words should clear the whole thing up in a jiffy. "This is ridiculous. Audrey, Eric, Angie, can you at least listen to what I have to say before burning your bridges?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three pairs of eyes converged on Gwen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen, tell them." Walken massaged his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperiously, Gwen sat up straight and dosed herself with a jolt of Almudj's Essence. Crossing her long legs, she squared her shoulders and extended her swan-neck. "Fair warning. I will NOT be interrupted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women snorted. &lt;br/&gt;Walken nodded. &lt;br/&gt;Elvia briefly met her gaze, her blue-eyes wild with alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First, Audrey. You are mistaken. Eric and I started as enemies at each other's throats. My Master, if you haven't read the backlog, is Henry Kilroy, Master of the Ten, and victim to your husband's grievous miscalculation. He's dead now, in no small part thanks to Eric. Later, when Walken first approached me in Shanghai, we almost came to blows. When my sister-in-craft, Alesia de Botton found him, she chased him across the university district flinging Fireballs. In time, he assumed the role of an advisor for Fudan's IIUC team, of which I was vice-captain. We went through the rounds, eventually ending up in the Chinese Undead Front. A Lich ambushed me, and not wanting to lose all his efforts in making it up to Alesia and my brother-in-craft, Gunther Shultz of Sydney, he risked his life to do what's best for him. Having lost a gambit, I shared with Walken some of my life. That was the broadcast where I revived him from the brink of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken nodded at Gwen, then at his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is why we're close." Gwen patted Walken on the shoulder in a familiar manner. "I don't know if you've ever fought a live Lich, but we survived one. At that moment, our lives were inextricably entwined. That's the reason why I trust him, and he trusts me. For Combat Mages, there exists a special bond of camaraderie that's difficult for civilians to internalise. But fear not, our bond is platonic and professional. With your husband beside me…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken inclined his chin in approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife, however, grew more frigid with every word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides her mother, Angie's mouth twisted with loathing. "Disgusting…" Angie mumbled. "Dad, you're disgusting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… and as my Chief Executive Officer—" Gwen bit her tongue. Her audience wasn't listening, though God knew why. Having come from a family championed by Morye no.1 in her old world, and Hai no.2 in her new world, she knew she was ill-equipped to be a family consultant. But Gwen had thought her monologue thoroughly diplomatic. If she were her mother's daughter, she would have slapped Audrey right in her sulky mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the wife was giving her the piss. Was exploring the beneficial bond between her and Walken insufficient? Perhaps Audrey needed to hear the jingle of crystals. How about a spiel about the profitability of Legion? Or the Isle? Or her Dwarves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eric." The wife spoke before she could continue. "We can make it to the Shard and get the forms signed before they shut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Audrey, my patience isn't without limits..." Walken undid his apron. Understandably, her companion had suffered enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was just as well; Gwen shrugged mentally. An unattached Walken would probably devote himself to work more readily than one with baggage. After his liberation, she could settle Walken down on the Isle as her majordomo. Once the Dwarves arrived, he would know how to deal with them. There was the matter of trade with the Red Keep as well, involving the import of jadeite and Maotai and other materials from Burma and beyond. Post commencement of her Spellcraft lessons, Walken would keep matters well in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dad, you're ridiculous…" &lt;br/&gt;"Not now, Angie..." &lt;br/&gt;"Don't you dare silence her! You're just a Baronet if even that!" &lt;br/&gt;"You two do whatever you want, and I don't complain…" &lt;br/&gt;"What do you call this then? Are you not complaining? I must have gone mad…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the noise began, Gwen tuned right out. It was amazing how some habits could cross over two lifetimes. Family disputes were all the same, everywhere. Vaguely, she felt sorry for her future officer, but really, Walken's family business was his own. All she could offer the man was work to free him from strife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was generosity enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"STOP! ALL OF YOU!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cry that rang out like clarion to quell the quarrel came from the unlikeliest of sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia stood, pale-faced, red-eyed and panting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're all wrong!" She howled at them, a little lioness clawing at the air. "GWEN ISN'T A HOMEWRECKER!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who are you to say so?" Angie challenged Gwen's companion. "Who are you to her?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am…" the girl paused. Gwen met her Evee's glimmering eyes. What was her cleric up to now? Why should she care about Walken?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Evee—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Gwen got her answer.&lt;br/&gt;Without reserve, hesitation nor warning, Elvia Lindholm; her sweet little Evee from Avalon— kissed her full on the lips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwennie was digging her own grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what Elvia knew of her friend's familial history, Gwen was the last person who should be giving Walken advice about marriage. The scenario was so insane that, as soon as they had passed the door, Elvia suspected Gwen would be swimming upstream through a river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How in God's name could two workaholics: one a power-hungry career politician who had left his family for almost a decade to work on the Frontier; the other an orphaned daughter of Hai and Helena— rekindle the flames of a snuffed marriage? The two arsonists of love might as well douse Brighton in Dwarven promethium, then invite Yue to start a bonfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gwen's explanation strayed into how important Walken was to her immediate future, Elvia had cringed so hard her chest cramped. When again, through the lens of meritocracy, Gwen had raised Walken above and beyond the boundaries of ordinary friendship, her heart grew sore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If even herself, who knew Magister Walken was not Gwens' carnal companion, was feeling such jealousy and frustration, what would Walken's family think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also Gwen's cold-heartedness, her complete disdain for the fact that a man was about to lose a wife and two daughters. How could her dearest friend be so kind, and yet be so insensitive to others? It was a side of Gwen she had rarely seen, one that sent shivers quivering down Elvia's spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private, Gwen had once remarked that family was a love that grew about the bone. If so, why should Walken slave away in the salt-mines of regret and bitterness for Gwen's convenience? Why not let go? Leave him to his family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, following Gwen's tirade, Walken's wife and daughter descended into self-harm, feeding on each other's flesh. As for Gwen, as soon as her friend's eyes glazed over, Elvia knew the girl had gone over a cliff and would not be coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was only one person present who could bring back the trio from the brink, and it was herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"STOP! ALL OF YOU!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her new-found sternness surprised even herself. When Angie, the foolish daughter of the Magister, furthermore challenged her with the absurd question of who she was to Gwen, all of her pent up frustration and longing cascaded into an unopposable, barrelling impulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a threshold that she had told herself never to cross, no matter how much she desired it. Growing up in Avalon by the bay, she understood the importance of boundaries all too well. Her house had overlooked the Shield Walls. These invisible barriers, these curtains of civilisation, were the final frontier of Sydney. Once past the shallows, past the final stretch of the continental shelf, came the dark water— murky and muddled and mired with Mermen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she crossed it. &lt;br/&gt;Thoughtlessly, she had stepped past the sandbar and plunged into the deep dark before her mind even registered that her feet were no longer touching the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To Gwen. I am the only one that matters." The voice that spoke was alien and strange, almost as if not her own. She must be sleep-talking, Elvia thought. Only in her dreams had she ever been so full of surety and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From her pocket, the newly awakened Kiki, stirred by the turbulent emotions welling up inside her torso, made itself known with an equally elated, "KIKI— KI!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen isn't for your husband," the voice of God continued. "Not now, not ever. So you have nothing to worry about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ki-ki!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The room sat in stunned silence, including Gwen, now the victim of a Gorgon's gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mister and Missus Walken!" Elvia wasn't sure if she could maintain her ethos after her implied logos of love, but she was up to her neck now and paddling free. She had only the experience of her sickeningly-loving parents as an anecdote— that and fifteen years of Sunday Service at St Mary's. "Earlier, you said that you hold 'certain' ceremonies sacred— inferring that you made a vow to love and care for one another in sickness and in health, till death do you apart. Is this true?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where were you married?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"St Andrews…" Walken's eyes darted between Gwen and then herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By a priest?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Bishop…" Walken intoned drily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then why do you neglect the Lord's sanctification? Did St Paul not say that husbands should love their wives, just as Christ loved the church, for he gave up his life for the latter? And YOU, Ma'am. As one with children, TWO in fact, how can you talk of divorce so carelessly? So selfishly? He who loves his wife loves himself. Man and woman; yolk of the one egg, who shall mock the flesh of their flesh? Why should Angie and Beatrix lack their parent? What kind of blasphemy do you propose to teach your children?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Audrey stared, bewildered by Elvia's accusation of apostasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… We're agnostic," Walken's wife interjected woodenly. "Papa wanted the chapel wedding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere grew somehow even more awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you love your wife, Magister Walken?" Elvia cashed her chips. She was all-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… I do." Walken nodded sheepishly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Say it then. Affirm yourself, Magister."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walken's scarlet face was no less carmine than his wife's. "I do still love you, Audrey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you, Audrey, still love your husband?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was hesitation. &lt;br/&gt;However, compelled by Elvia's angelic aura, Audrey nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Say it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I… don't hate him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Angie? Do you want mum and dad to go their separate ways?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jesus, I am in university…" Angie cowered in her chair. "Miss Lindholm, please don't make me say this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia channelled her inner Gwen, pouring positive mana throughout her conduits until she appeared to glow with unadulterated altruism. Likewise, tapping into what little Faith she had collated in the last few days, she threw in a silent invocation of Bless, turning a few motes of her outward projection golden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… I love you both…" Angie cringed against the chair, every inch an Undead compelled by the sun. "Oh my God… someone Void me right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then love each other deeply, because only love shall overcome the multitude of your sins," Elvia repeated the often spoken mantra drilled into her brain by the Matrons at Nightingales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And another thing." She wasn't finished just yet. "Why do you think we came all this way? We're not just here for you, Sir Walken. Not at all! Gwen knew about Angie's mana asthma, and I may have a way to deal with her condition in the interim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do?" Her companion blinked. "We did?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course. Did you forget? We came to seek Master Walken's aid in making a Greater Familiar contract-circle," Elvia announced. "Through Sen-sen, we may once again gain access to something akin to Lord Henry's Golden Mead, or at least a facsimile. If the Essence of Mythic Dragons isn't going to overcome something as worldly as hyper-inflammation of the respiratory tracts, then I would be supremely surprised by the Yinglong's existence beside Shanghai's world-class miasma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Y— you have Golden Mead?" Walken and his wife spoke up at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not if you don't corroborate with Gwen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll cooperate." The Magister affirmed his new loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, it was all a misunderstanding." Audrey inclined her head. "My apologies. Angie, apologise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Umm..." Angie appeared confused. "Sorry?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GOOD." Elvia's aura of benevolence faded. "Do everything in love. Amen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sat back down.&lt;br/&gt;Just as her external crisis faded, her internal uproar rang out like an air siren. Slowly, she wrapped her arms around her torso, curled her knees into a foetal stance, then folded herself like origami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A threshold had been crossed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was out now. Out and out. Out past the shallows, past the sand bar and the rolling white shoals brimming with mana, out where the sun burned bright, glimmering as blinding shards of scintillating silver, fleeing toward the great blue yonder; unbound and outside the shelter of Sydney's Shielding Stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">492689</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 12:18:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 344 - A Cold Welcome</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/490353</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday brought a rare lull in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two frigid evenings past Boxing Day, the zeal of gift-giving finally gave way to old enmities, restoring the city of London to cynicism as usual. At six-thirty AM sharp, from the icy coast of Canisbay to the southern-most part of Cornwall, the folk of England awoke to the sound of the paper boy's adolescent holler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"DWARFIES to reopen the ye old RED KEEP! OLD Ally NEWLY back in the fold!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every news agency, tram station and vendor stand, similar images of the Gate of Kazhul, wide-open for the first time in three decades, splayed across the tabloids. Lower, nearer the article itself, a portrait that had now thrice graced the red-letter tabloids smiled winsomely at the audience with sparkling eyes, promising exciting things to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over in Cambridge, Peterhouse, under the sheltered groves in the Deer Garden, over the clinking of heirloom silverware, Lady Grey shared a spot of morning tea with an old nemesis, "Dickie" Mycroft Ravenport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With pleasure, The Lady of Ely revelled in the fact that she had been the very first to know of the Murk Dwarves' new stance toward the Mageocracy, and so had time to position her pieces just right. Though she had contributed nothing of note to the endeavour, the ambassador responsible for cracking the hard-headed Dwarves had been sent at her behest. In high-society, this meant Gwen's accolades were foremostly hers, then Peterhouse's, then Gwen's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to withdraw two Mage Flights and a triage team to babysit her unannounced caper," Ravenport intoned annoyedly. "You know what Ireland's like this time of the year. The Militia's short-staffed as it is, and now the Mercenaries are delving en-mass into Merthyr Tydfil like mud down a sinkhole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mistress of Peterhouse waited for a block of loosely-compressed sugar to wholly dissolve before taking a sip of her steaming, yearling Devonshire. "Is that so bad? London has effectively gained access to a virgin Dungeon, one that's untouched since the Beast Tide. Which of the central powers can boast the same? And it's close to home as well, no need for complex logistics. Surely your people stand to benefit more than they can lose?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've no idea what's down there, Maxi." Ravenport buttered a scone with far too much marmalade. Unbeknownst to his enemies, the stone-cold, sable-clad Duke of Norfolk had a sweet tooth. "The girl reported that she fought a Wyrm! A mutated, draconic Earthen Worm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's Gwen's Wyrm now," Maxine corrected her childhood companion. "Ergo, the danger is now sans Wyrm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft meticulously masticated, swallowed, then continued. "There's no such thing as a free lunch. The Dwarves are not fools, least of all Whurforlüm. Did you know my grandfather was the last Tower Mage to confide with the Guild Master in person? Now I, his grandson, must broker a deal with the same Dwarf. You understand how vexing that could be?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A tad rich, coming from one who negotiated our treaty with the Hvítálfar," Maxine said carefully. "Aren't the highborn effectively immortal? The first Duke of Norfolk, working under Henry V, would have dealt with the same aldermen as you had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wholly different," Mycroft refuted the implied hypocrisy. "The Hvítálfars are changeless, immutable, whereas the Dökkálfars are prone to change, only slower and more stubborn. A century from now, Snowdonia would remain as it has always been, out of touch— and reach— but can you say the same of Eth Rjoth Kjangtoth? The girl wants to punch through the Murk and connect their citadel back into the Dyar Morkk. I shudder to think they would succeed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is that so bad?" The Lady relayed her amusement at Mycroft's frustration. "You've been trying to tempt the Dwarves— well, OUR Dwarves, for years. You're just upset that Gwen did the job of the Foreign Office in place of your lackeys, am I right? At any rate, whatever muck will hit the Dwarves first and foremost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What an unkind thing to say." Mycroft sipped his tea, making a slight scowl. One of the reasons he did enjoy Maxine's company was that as equals, and as acquaintances since they were children, there wasn't too dire a need for facades and frivolities. After a long few days herding vipers, it was surprising how much one longed for candidness. "My Faction employs the finest men and women our country has to offer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am reminded of an oriental idiom." Maxine fought back a grin. "Black cat, white cat, fat or lean, a good cat is the one that catches the mice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now you're rubbing salt in my wounds." Mycroft sighed. "Enjoy it while you can Maxi. Your whelp will stumble sooner or later. Then you'll have to come to me to clean up her mess."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen can afford the reparations. Isn't that wonderful, Dickie? What a fortuitous investment Henry has left us, the gift that keeps on giving. All profit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Profit?" Ravenport's nostrils twitched. "You realise the Dwarves have submitted a hundred thirty-four requests for Resonators? One-Twenty of which was for overland travel to Central Europe. A mob of them to Sharr, a crowd to the Rila, a horde to Berchtesgaden and Lowland Bavaria. The Shard has decided to show our generosity and throw in diplomatic travel and Teleportation. Over in the mainland, their Towers are charging us arms and legs for the privilege of ferrying Journeymen to visit their cousins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assuming twelve of them are Gwen's merry men, are any others staying in London?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two dozen. Liaisons for the Freelancers. The Guild Master said they don't just want any riff-raff raiding in the Murk. There'll be cultural sensitivity training on both sides and a new licence office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And what?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is your department getting out of this, Dickie? Don't tell me a bloodsucker like you has suddenly caught an outbreak of philanthropy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft twirled a dessert fork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've sent visitation applications to the Germanic and Icelandic citadels, as well as Dwarven enclaves in the Eastern Reaches. Requests for visitation and overland travel should be flooding in as we speak. Naturally, we hope to recoup our costs and then some."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How are our own responding to this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft's pursed lips edged upward. "It's been a while since we could commission regional Dwarven battle-gear. Just the demand for Spellswords is driving the Militant Faction into a tizzy. The Knight Orders as well are demanding a refresh to their armoury. For a few years now, the youngsters have been making do with re-forged facsimiles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maxine chuckled. "How desperate are the men?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Order of St George has offered to send Knight Commander Springfield with a Squadron of his best Hunters to scour the Murk if it means the Ordo can have first-privileges on custom blades. The Griffin Guard is keen for updated Spell-lances, though understandably, the underground nature of the Murk has limited their application."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have this well in hand, I assume?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Naturally, a good blood-letting— by which I mean a public auction, is in order. We shall soon see who has deeper pockets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Boys and their toys." Maxine rolled her eyes. "No extra Golems for the Kingdom's forces?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Red Citadel's designs aren't as easily modified as the German Mark IV's." Ravenport shook his head. "Besides, the contracts are set in stone. We're still waiting on a delivery of two-hundred by next year's end. The department's current budget does not allow for more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nonetheless, you must be a popular man right now. More so than usual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft affirmed the Lady's observation, then signalled a change in the subject by switching to an after-meal tea. As though hoisted by a poltergeist, the tea sets rearranged themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always digress when it comes to you. Very unpleasant. Now— back to the subject of our sorceress. My sources from Hong Kong have informed me that the Communists are ready to make a move on her assets in Shanghai, in particular, her cut of Tonglv."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be expected." The Lady shrugged. "Would you allow a Chinese Magister part ownership of the Royal Docks?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You jest, but the clever thing is, they're accusing her of the very thing. Supposedly, she's supplying the Royal Docks. Naturally, rumours suggest she's consorting with myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supplying you with what, exactly?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fanciful finance she sold to Shanghai via the Pudong Tower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is it true?" The Lady of Ely raised a brow. "You did accost her at Heathrow. She told me all about it. Did the two of you consort beyond what's proper?" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"No, nothing of the sort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And did you, Dickie Ravenport, as one of the four major stakeholders of the Royal Docklands, deny such an accusation?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft grinned like a shot fox. "I declined to comment, as did my colleagues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lady shot her confrere a concerning glare. "Nanny always said you were a nasty boy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nanny knows best. I wonder, though. Do you think the girl has contingencies in place?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should I?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maxine covered her smirk with a side of scone. "If anyone should know, it should be you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?" Mycroft shrugged. "What is she to me? Am I the Oracle of Delphi?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lady of Ely looked up from her teacup. "On a brighter note. Have you finalised the roster for Snowdonia?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft paused, sensing an unpleasant premonition rising to the fore. Maxine Loftus seldom made requests of her companions; when she did, the Lady of Ely expected satisfaction. "You jest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't you think it'll be interesting?" Lady Loftus' eyes became two smiling half-moons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maxine." The Duke of Norfolk replaced the fine china, indicating that he suddenly recalled pressing business. "I really must be going."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dickie," his companion's tone grew dangerously charming. "Care for a wager?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Duke paused. "Go on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll loan you the girl for the Isle of Man if indeed she's caught flatfooted by the scheming Orientals. Else, you have to find her a suitable instructor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft squared his shoulders "You wager that an adolescent, much less a Frontier bumpkin from Sydney, would possess enough personal or local clout to fend off an attempt by the Party to retrieve an infrastructural apparatus linked to gross domestic output? Am I to believe Lord Shultz will be shortly gracing Shanghai?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My confidence in Gwen nears the supernatural."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycroft let lose an undulating wave of uncharacteristic laughter. From the shadows among the trees, his footman, ever attentive Elliot Saville, materialised to aid the Duke in donning his outer coat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the warmth of the Warding Mandala, the frigid winter whistled through the gothic fruit trees haunting the Deer Garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fine." Mycroft donned his hat. "My scepticism is no less supreme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Maxine Loftus' face, the Lady of Ely blossomed as though Juno summoning a second spring. Raising her cup, she toasted the departing Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Til next time, Dickie. May our communist friends live in interesting times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Isle of Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magus Gwen Song; honorary Magus of Peterhouse, relayed the events of the past three days to her dearest provisional-practitioner of Magical Medicine, Elvia Lindholm of Great Osmond Street Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it had been only three days, the stimulation afforded by the influx of HDMs had changed the atmosphere of Millwall from humid and mouldy to merely bedraggled. The streets which were previously choked with black snow, industrial waste and mud from the sea-swell had all been cleared, leaving the Victorian cobblestone exposed and glistening under the dreary wintery sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dilapidated press, Gwen's targeted industrial operation, had likewise been unearthed by human hands wrought of flesh and powered by fragile hope, revealing a hint of its former glory. Gwen's only gripe was the townfolk's dubious grasp of sustainability. Downstream, a month on, the Royal Docklands would inevitably discover a glut of old trash clogging up its eastern in-takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was Hanmoul upset?" Elvia listened, the very picture of attention, "When you told him Ollie was a spy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not after I bribed him with a dozen Da-peng feathers," Gwen explained. "He forgot all about Ollie after that. Said it wasn't the lad's fault, and that he had to deal with the Clan Heads and the Deepdowners all the time in a similar fashion. Every time he came to Merthyr Tydfil, he took notes and bought information as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hanmoul's not among the twelve to come here?" Elvia spoke with disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen shook her head. "The Commandrumm will be all kinds of busy dealing with the new operations to clear a way through the Murk. He's working hand-in-glove with our representative from the Shard though, so there's a chance he might be able to visit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A shame, I rather like Mister Bronzeborn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, he's a good bloke, one of the best I've met. Tell you what though. Give it some time and we can both look forward to working with him again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly, Gwen polished off her richly laden bowl of SPAM soup, a concoction of cabbage, tomato paste and copious amounts of Spam sliced and boiled until falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her roster had left little time for cuisine. Since returning from Merthyr Tydfil, she had reported to Lady Gray, dropped off Ollie to recover his sanity, then jetted her way at maximum velocity back to her Evee. After spending a night cuddling the healer's hot water-bottle body, she had risen, rested and restored enough to expend her final few days of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there was Walken. Then, she had to locate Dominic Lorenzo and recruit him for the free paper gig as soon as possible. When her Dwarves arrived in a month, she had a feeling that things would be moving very quickly indeed. Assuming all went well, she should be wrapt in secret studies, meaning she had to have delegates set up and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So." Gwen studied her flaxen-haired companion. "Ready to add a second Spirit to your menagerie?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sure am!" Elvia nodded, bobbing her fringe back and forth. Each day Sen-sen remained an unattached ginseng was a source of disquiet and danger for the not-so-well connected Cleric. "Have you found Master Walken?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lady Loftus gave me his country house address," Gwen said. "No wonder he's disappeared from Cambridge, the old dog's in Brighton."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The resort town?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The very one." Gwen grinned. "Lucky for us, eh? We can take a stroll along the beach. Eat ice cream by the ivory pavilion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's winter and five degrees out..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... buy scarves, shoes and dresses from the Lanes, dine on sea scallops by the seashore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought we're there to find Master Walken's family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That too." Gwen laughed. "I take it all's well in Millwall? Are you fine to be absent?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not really…" Elvia sulked. "The other Clerics aren't giving it their all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is Mathias not doing his job?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is," Elvia quickly interjected, pointing to the lone figure of the Knight patrolling the aid station and the food hall. "I guess the Tower hires find it strange that we're treating the NoMs, destitute ones at that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you tell those snobs Lady Astor and Lady Gray are your sponsors?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we are…?" Elvia cocked her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are," Gwen assured her friend. "Trust me on this. Why else would they offer?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Umm…" Elvia pursed her petite, pink lips, the picture of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll have a word with Mathias and our trio of hired help." Gwen flashed her Peterhouse Magus emblem. "I spent good CCs on those Clerics. They had better be OoM at the end of every shift, or somebody is going to suffer a stern word from Caliban."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://imgur.com/2Q3gE3J.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen was very much glad that Brighton was where Walken had chosen to hole up because she adored the resort town in her old world. Of course, her glee had little to do with its famous beach— Australia's beaches were incontestable when it came to the quality and quantity of bronzed-bodies being tanned. Instead, she longed for its white-domed pier, its orient-influenced Royal Pavilion, its trendy art-house cafes and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the journey south, flying toward the curvature of the coast with Evee princess-carried against her torso was itself a pleasure. The squirming, squealing girl's fright gave her no end of sadistic joy as she pumped more and more mana into her flight spell, piercing the air with such velocity that Brighton came within view within the hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-way over the rolling hills of West Sussex, the duo encountered a flock of Razor-billed Starlings, appearing as a vast net to enmesh the pair. A robust burst of pseudo-Dragon-fear from Ariel was enough to spare the ten-thousand or so spatchcocks. The farmhouse below, however, was left inundated in a sudden downpour of panicked deposits, spontaneously inspiring a scene from Hitchcock's "The Birds".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closer to the sea, once accustomed to the skin-ship, her companion relaxed, staring in wide-eyed wonder at a vista which only those willing to pay the gratuitous cost of Flight could see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should learn a faster Flight Spell," Gwen murmured. The velocity was as therapeutic as Evee's delightful squeals. "I recall Allie employed Greater Flight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a higher-tier Transmutation though," Elvia jittered as they plummeted downwards. When the seaside pavilion rapidly approached, Gwen cut their velocity via a rapid series of Dimension Doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When finally the duo appeared on the ground, it was to the shock of the Town Guards on the watchtowers, whose Scrying diagnostics implicitly surmised that anyone licensed to be flying into town would not appreciate overcurious public servants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Erg— sand." Gwen grimaced. The idea of landing on Brighton Beach with Evee had been so enthralling she had neglected the impossibility of walking on sand in four-inch heels. Of course, the annoyance aside, she had good cause to loathe the touch of cold, clinging sand-grit. "It's coarse and irritating and gets everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry…" Elvia apologised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What for?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wasn't there for you when Debbie…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all in the Void now." Gwen dismissed her friend's concern. "Really. Caliban can be very therapeutic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both wishing to quell the rising sentiment, the two unfurled the town map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvia's attire matched the winter decor, with her petite figure bundled in a knee-length overcoat and enclosed by a pair of suede booties. Gwen was her usual stubborn self, preferencing a light autumn-dress with stockings, vying for maximum comfort. Thanks to Almudj's blessing, the ravages of the seasons seldom touched her skin, though as a Sydney-sider, she had never bothered with winter-wear across either of her two lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walken's address…" Gwen diverted her attention to the legend, both brows sulky with confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Allow me." Elvia turned the map ninety degrees. "It's close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shall we fly?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The apartments here are tightly staggered." Her helpful Elf steered them onward. "You'll never find it. Besides, it says 11/43 Chester Terrace, Brighton East. We'll have to consult the locals. The buildings here all look the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right," Gwen relented. There was certainly nothing wrong with a seaside stroll with Elvia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they cleared the beach, she was pleased to find that the ivory-facade Brighton was famous for had not faded in this world, but expanded to encompass entire blocks. Though her present world lacked many quality-of-life improvements in information technology, its sorcerous means of erecting buildings was second to none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's beautiful," Elvia marvelled as they strolled through King's Parade, overlooking the lapping blue-green waters of the English Channel on their left. The Lanes remained as Gwen had recalled, though more built up, with a significant extension of the Lanes. Gone, however, were the trendy boutiques—instead, trinket-makers, jewellery-crafters, and an assortment of fabric-sellers, seamstress' abodes and gift-emporiums had replaced the familiar sights. After an eye-opening meander, Gwen made a note to take Elvia to a sweets shop called "Charlie's Crystal Emporium", a business with patrons spilling out the doors. Secretly, she hoped that there would be something akin to Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans of Potter-lore. Surely that would be a fun game to play with Evee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few twists and turns from helpful, neighbourly individuals who seemingly appeared out of thin air to aid Elvia with directions, the duo looked upon No. 11/43 Chester Terrace, Brighton East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, the abode was not an apartment but a townhouse with shared walls, as was proper for those with the means to afford the view. Impressively, the beach-facing home was three-storeys tall, crammed between two identical apartments in the same Regency style that made Brighton such a throwback to the halcyon days of empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen inhaled in the frigid sea air. Despite the Shielding Stations shimmering in the distance, there was almost no detectable trace of mana miasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bloody good location," she remarked, glancing at the marina and its collection of private yachts. In a world of Mermen and monsters, a vessel spoke loudly of the owner's confidence at sea. Barring the most unfortunate of cases, it was a Mermaid's great misfortune to run into a group of eager Maguses and Magisters fishing for rare specimens. "Well then, shall we?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shouldn't we Message Master Walken first?" Elvia withered in the shadow of the stately townhouse, plausibly worth more than a whole student wing at Nightingales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His device isn't in service." Gwen shrugged. "Besides, it'll be interesting to see what he's up to, don't you think? Maybe he's intimately catching up with his estranged wife."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen!" Elvia appeared scandalised. "You have the wildest imagination... Maybe we should wait?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost mid-day, and he's unemployed," Gwen snorted. "Barring coitus interruptus, she'll be right, mate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pressed the doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A delightful chime thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief lull later, the door opened, revealing a young brunette who could only be one of Walken's daughters. Unmistakably, the girl sported the same charcoal-coloured eyes as her father, an unusual hue among Saxons. Beatrix or Angie? Gwen wondered. The girl had the look of a second child, meaning she must be Angie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their eyes met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen put forward her most endearing, benevolent, winsome smile. She felt almost maternal toward the girl, notwithstanding the difference in their age. Having guided Walken with a tender hand in Shanghai, her feelings toward her colleague's children were full of benevolence, especially Angie, who suffered from Mana Asthma. Just as her Master had taken care of Angie, so would she.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good Afternoon! My name is Magus Gwen Song, this my colleague, Elvia Lindholm. We're here to see your father, Magister Walken."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she announced herself, Angie's smile arrested, then like the coming of permafrost, the girl's expression grew increasingly rigid. An Ice Mage? Gwen applauded Walken's genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unanticipated chill, Gwen maintained maximum amicability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is your father in—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MOTHER!" the girl cried out suddenly, her voice crackling with ice. "THE WHORE OF BABYLON HAS COME FOR DAD!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">490353</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 10:35:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 343 - Honour's Tongue</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/487846</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Gwen stood regal as a Tudor Rose in the sunken amphitheatre, garbed in ivory and carmine, possessing a poise befitting a virgin queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly overhead, positioned just so that they could still look down on the petitioner, sat the Grand Council of Eth Rjoth Kjangtoth. To her right, appearing with the air of a funeral, sat a trio of iron-clad Deepdowners in their all-enveloping armour, attended by a train of sycophants. To her left sat the Clan Heads, representing the common interest of the citizens. Finally, directly ahead, Whurforlüm Ironførge, Master of the Rotary Guild, surveyed the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Hanmoul Bronzeborn, Commandrumm of the Hammer Guard, the Iron Born scion of Bürumm-Dal Irøngut, had appraised his case for satisfying the Debt of Haj-Zül. In its aftermath, Gwen registered her demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… in turn, I wish to obtain the aid of my brother-in-arms for my industrial endeavours. MY petition shall be satisfied with a staff of no less than twelve technicians split among Tuners and Runesmiths, including one Alchemist, lead by a Master, to travel with me to London for the duration of one Stone Cycle. Between our Adventurers and your Technicians, there shall be mutual benefit and common gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AND they won't work for free. All employees shall receive an attractive stipend," Gwen continued with relish. "In minerals, in HDMs, in knowledge if they so desire, or the freedom to journey to Bavaria and back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guild Master, Whurforlüm "Wilhelm" Ironførge, nodded encouragingly. The Clan heads, appearing as a cluster of beards, held various expressions from uncertainty to disdain to ambivalence. The Deepdowners were unreadable thanks to their masks, though Gwen could sense their flesh-flensing stares just the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My last petition, as Commandrumm Hanmoul has noted, is for the Magitech Enchantment known as the Echoing Glyph to be supplied to my firm, 'Legion' Proprietary Limited, as an exclusive patent secured by London Tower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nervous ripple spread from left to right. &lt;br/&gt;One of the Deepdowners growled, sounding like a seismic rumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AHEM—" An uptown Dwarf with a beard the size of a broom made his displeasure known, then rose from the semi-circle rows of the amphitheatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Magus Song." The Dwarf made a show of drawing eyes from around the room. "I must object."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen acknowledged her "objector" by relenting the floor. She was not surprised that the Deepdowners had nominated a noble to kneecap her request. If Hilda hadn't warned her, she would now be furious that the Dwarves were undercutting Hanmoul's obligations. As the noblewoman had said, the Deepdowners' faction loathed even a single mote of Earthen Mana escaping the earth. Opposing her attempt to bring Humans in, or to bring Dwarves out, came as naturally to them as breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen studied the fine-bearded Dwarf. From what she had seen of the Dwarves' frugal fashion, her present opponent was excessively-dressed for the part. His beard, for one, was bound in what looked like Mithril bands, and the Dwarf's hands were encrusted with enchanted jewels. Making his way up the dais, the Dwarf lord stopped as soon as he gained the height advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A politician; Gwen recognised the Walken-esque sneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we ur among Clan, fowk an' friends, Ay shall speak candidly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her bullshit senses tingled. The bastard had come with a speech! Gwen quickly glanced at Ollie. Her Praelector was already sweating buckets from her earlier proclamations. Ollie was a scholar, a student, a primrose of fantastic breeding, but one of Ravenport's finest he was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the amphitheatre, a murmur of agreement met the nobleman, making Gwen suspect more than a few were conservative plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ye all ken my name— Brugal Brumdahr." The Dwarf pointed his considerable chin down toward Gwen's general direction. "Mine Clan has been the theme of honour's tongue since the time of Haj-Zül Brumdahr, frae whose loins we ur issued. Ay dunnae think there is a better Iron Born to speak of the Debt and the honour of repayment other than Ay. If any of ye in this hall ken themselves moor suited tae speak for the Clans, then dear friends, make your voice knoon..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rhetorical question met with silence. Gwen sought out the Guild Master with her eyes. Up top, the master craftsmen seemed content to see the drama play out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aye, we agree, then," Brugal continued. "Under our law, as in our LORE, the debt between Haj-Zül Brumdahr to Bürumm-Dal woz a matter of rivalry, friendship— or loove, if the Matrons have their say—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clan Heads laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"— Aye, Bürumm-Dal's admiration and love, was the source of his Debt of life. Yet, to call what we owe this mercenary, this free-lancer, this hired Goorumm from the Overland the Debt of Haj-Zül— it pains me. The honour of our home, the honour of Clan Brumdahr, has never been so diminished! The Debt is something we rejoice in, and yit, when news reached me lugs that we are sending our wee jimmies and Masters of the Rune to Lundun? To that blighted, lidless place? I cood nae sit idle, mah friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barely veiled insult sent a touch of heat to kiss Gwen's cheeks. More than her pride, however, she felt for Hanmoul. Already, the Commandrumm's face was scarlet, like a trodden-on Displacer Beast, his beard was sticking end-on-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dunnae look at me so peevish, Hanmoul. Yer know I honour the Hammer Guard and yer battle-kin. But yer gotter ken, me man, as yer was valorous, so I supported yer. But as yer trade our kin to the Overlander, I must oppose ye. Aye, yer saved our fellow Clansmen— Just last night, I quaffed to yer health! But now, Commandrumm, I see yer ambition has out-grown the boundaries of yer duty; and so I must put yer back in yer Golem, lad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Giltho—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"—Hanmoul, let me finish," Brugal's voice grew hypnotic. He turned away from Hanmoul and instead faced the assembling of Clan Heads seated here and there around the upper quadrant of the amphitheatre. "As yer can see, the Commandrumm aye offended. BUT is anyone here equally vexed that I wish tae preserve our purity? Our culture? Our doctrine? LOOK! Gaze upon the visage of our Lore Keepers, and see how they seethe! Who dares say that ay acted out of turn? Who can say Brugal am wrong? Misguided ye art, Hanmoul, we know yer yearning for the surface lad— but upward is not dae way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanmoul choked as the noblemen dragged his petition through the Murk, too upset to compose a rebuttal. Gwen could see that the Commandrumm was a fighter, not a debater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What say ye, Witch? Did yer think our kind so innocent as to allow yer tae abscond with our knowledge?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Abscond?" her lips split to form a forced smile. Without the beard to go with the grin; however, she wasn't sure if the Dwarves could be sufficiently titillated. "You, Ser, must be unaware of the contributions I have made to your esteemed city. The Wyrm? The Trolls? Was Commandrumm Hanmoul so lacking in charisma that you feel personally insulted by his achievements?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dunnae speak of Hanmoul ter me, lass. He is one of our own. Yer Mageocracy harkens after our Golems and our Mithril. Do tell, Witch, what do ye intend to do with our craftsmen? Excavate our secrets with yer Mind Magic?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do object!" Ollie raised a hand. "Sir Dwarf, you mistake my sister's purpose. She's after Crystals, nothing more!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then why not ask for Crystals? The human lust for HDMs is well-known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen gave Ollie a withering look, then took a deep breath. Brugal put on a good show, she had to admit; but she was no stranger to smarmy snakes in business suits. The self-proclaimed descendent of Haj-Zül whats-his-name talked a good game, but little did the Dwarf know he was now in the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you an artificer or a warrior yourself, esteemed Sir?" She tested the waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Do yer mock me, Magus?" The Dwarf's brows knitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen's sultry lips formed a thin red line. With her eagle-eyes, she could see that Brugal's hands had not seen a day of labour. She felt sorry for Hanmoul. How disappointing it was that not even the Dwarve's meritocratic society could escape the malaise of inherited wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't dream of it, Ser Brumdahr." She feigned ignorance. "But I fear you have misread me from the beginning. Such a misconception is unbecoming of a Clan Lord."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, it was the Brugal's beard that bristled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your worries were apt, Ser," Gwen observed, then she addressed the entire assembly, including the Deepdowners. If the barrel-shaped lawyer wished to play the rat, Gwen mulled darkly; then she would play the piper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Friends, Dwarves, Fellows of the Murk; I humbly beg for a minute more of your time." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clan Heads maintained a polite silence. The Guild Master shifted in his seat, while the Deepdowners sat unmoved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand Ser Brugal's many insecurities. They are well-founded, for Ser Brumdahr is the theme of honour's tongue, and indeed, so are all of our present company. However, if Ser Brumdahr wishes to speak ill of my dear battle-mate, Commandrumm Hanmoul, then I too, shall throw in my gauntlet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with her pantomime, she opened the tap on Almudj's Essence, arresting her viewers with supernatural, newfound confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we first met, Ser Bronzeborn was fighting for his life. Not for his gain, nor for honour or glory. Thanklessly, he was protecting the ventilation systems that lead from the surface down to the heart of your city. The gallant engine of his Rockcrusher had been torn apart by a Brutaliser, ripped limb from limb, bleeding liquid-mana and blue-green coolant over the linen snow. One bite from the Troll and Hanmoul would have perished. Oh, when I found him, my friends! The Commandrumm bled from every pore; his courage had congealed against his armour in strands of coagulant gore! And YET he carried on!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen paused, taking a step so that she rose a little up the dais, matching Brugal's gaze. "Was this ambition? Was he fighting for the LOVE of Himmseg? Or was it Dwarven dogma?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brugal's expression grew worrisome. "Even a tongue of True Silver won't—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ser Brumdahr!" Gwen spun without warning, turning on Brugal like a viper. "Ser! I am EIGHTEEN— a 'wee' lass. A True Silver Tongue? For shame, Ser! Is mine a face of cunning? But then again, I can't refute your claim. Unlike YOU, I am NOT the theme of honour's tongue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Dwarf could retort, she raised her voice once more, this time weaving a spot of Ventriloquism so that her suppressed emotions reverberated across the amphitheatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I met Ser Bronzeborn again, it was at this very Citadel. At its gate, a toothy horror with a dozen tongues hailing straight from the deepest, darkest depth had found its way into your abode. There, the guards informed us that the Wyrm had Dwarf-napped your kin! Your Clansmen! Your family and citizens! For egg-fodder! For WORMS MEAT!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her audience flinched as her irises glowed, circulating a dazzling play of colours. "Naturally, possessing no desire to risk my life, I shrugged. I am a greedy, conniving Human Sorceress. I just wanted to be let into the Citadel and stake my claim—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BUT— Ser Bronzeborn wouldn't have it! He was an avatar of Dwarfdom! Naive and altruistic! He wanted to help without the backup of the Rockcrushers! He arrested my wrists— like so, and looked me in the eye and said 'Lass, my kin aye down there.' I asked him what was in it for me, and he said to me, 'Whatever yer desire, Human, from mah beard to me bones.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanmoul stared with his mouth half-open, likely wondering if the Jäger Bombes addled their collective memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was moved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, without warning, Gwen took a step upward so that she now rose above Brugal. "But I digress. What do I know? I am not like Ser Brumdahr over yonder, the bloody theme of honour's tongue, whistling, whistling away like a leaking steam-vent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The noble blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BRUGAL!" Gwen suddenly spat, a spot of spittle striking the Dwarf like a bolt of lightning. "When we were neck-deep in Wyrm-spit and up to our crotch in Copper Worms, where were you and your honourable men?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chuckle broke out from behind the row of Clan Heads. Someone was enjoying the spectacle. On the central platform, Whurforlüm twirled the gavel in between his fingers, fighting back a smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brugal Brumdahr took a step back, only now realising he was seized in the jaws of a proverbial Wyrm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ser Bronzbeard risked his life and the life of his men to bring back the bodies of your kin so that their Spirits could be consigned to the Stone," Gwen drew out the timbre of emotion in her voice. "But what would he know? He's not like you, Milord Brumdahr. He's not the theme of bloody honour's tongue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cadence picked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we brought those poor Dwarves back to the gate, we spoke to the families as their husbands, wives, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters lay there, cold and unmoving." Gwen implored the Clan Heads, taking another step so that she towered above them, matching the Guild Master's platform with the help of her heels. "Were you among them?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She leaned down to deliver the coup de grâce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What did you do for them? Brugal?"&lt;br/&gt;"Blame Hanmoul? Did a Wyrm eat your conscience?"&lt;br/&gt;"Was this the Commandrumm's lauded love for the surface?"&lt;br/&gt;"If Hanmoul's a turncoat, then what are you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I-insolence!" Brugal's face had grown to encompass the likeness of a cornered mole-rat. "Yer— ye—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you should sit down." Gwen patted the Dwarf on the shoulder. "You're not yourself, Lord Brumdahr."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve the desired effect, she momentarily flooded her conduits with Void. Borrowing from the exercise she had learned from Ayxin, Gwen focused her intent until Brugal visibly lost his balance. Then, with a kind, helping hand, she steered him toward his seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, for visual effect, Gwen straightened her spine. "Anyone else got—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHOMP!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assembly, with exception to the Guild Master and Gwen, collectively flinched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Deepdowners rose to his considerable height, standing a whole head taller than the rest in their custom, hermetically sealed armour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ARROGANCE!" A booming voice, projected as though through a loud hailer, deafened the room. "ALL IS VANITY."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeper Muirrigg!" The Guild Master, as Gwen's bathing buddy had predicted, came to her aid as soon as the Deepdowners breached their custodial duty. "Your opinion is appreciated but not needed, Ser. As per the Ancestor's teachings, the Keepers of Lore shall not interfere with the ruling of a Citadel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I AM SAVING YOU FROM YOURSELVES." The Deepdowner had a voice like gravel. "THIS FEMALE, CAN YOU NOT TASTE THE DEATH ON HER SKIN? SHE IS VADAM, A WALKING CALAM—."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen felt her lips twitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BAH! Ay have had just aboot enough fer this!" Hanmoul stepped in front of her, his hand half-drawing his Spellsword. Gwen could see that her impassioned defence had ignited the Commandrumm's berserker-blood, as was expected of a scion of Irøngut. "Scorning the Debt of Haj-Zül! Insulting mine battle-mate! That es proper Dwarven now, AYE?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both of you! Calm yourselves!" Whurforlüm slammed the table with a miniature war hammer. "Your distemper shames us all!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"THE SURFACER INVITES OUR DOOM," the Deepdowner persisted. A swirl of unadulterated Earthen mana flooded the space where the man stood. Gwen knew not how Dwarven Magic worked, but what she sensed was no less than a tier 5 Transmutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CALI!" Gwen conjured Caliban, materialising in the middle of the amphitheatre the living embodiment of the Deepdowner's dread. Whurforlüm stayed the guards with a wave of his hand; a few of the Clan Heads reached for their wands, though none chose to act. Behind the Deepdowner, their entourage made a show of rattling mailed gloves and magical implements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I may speak?" Gwen's Clarion Call shook the room while Caliban soaked the attention like a sponge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SHAA! SHAA!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As I said earlier." She pointed to her serpent. "There has been a miscommunication. If you allow me to finish without interruption, I shall ratify all concerns. If you remain unsatisfied after, I shall leave and never return. But if you deny me, then I shall exact my price with interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen!" Ollie appeared entangled in a nightmare. "P-put away Caliban now!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ollie." Gwen placed a hand on her Praelector's shoulders. "Sit down and keep Ser Brumdahr company. He's looking faint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confused and shaken as to why Gwen reprimanded his perfectly sensible advice, the Praelector did as told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now." Gwen returned to her captive audience. "You accuse me of wanting to steal your precious Dwarven Golems. I have no idea where you even got this idea. I don't need your Golems, be it the Striders, the Rockcrushers, or the Irongrinders because of a simple fact—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the audience could react, rippling waves of nauseating feed-back flooded the chamber. Caliban began to moult, its carapace growing grotesque as her Familiar bloated. From the size of three Dwarves standing head-to-toe, it grew and grew, filling the spacious amphitheatre until the enormous council-chamber felt claustrophobic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dwarves, captive in their elevated seats, reared back as Caliban continued to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Wyrm whose Core Caliban had consumed, the Void Wyrm was a horrifying thing, possessing more mouth than any other physiological apparatus. When her Familiar finally finished its bloated metamorphosis, leaving the Void Sorceress covered in a sheen of cold sweat, it stood thirty meters from end to end, possessing enough tentacles to pluck the whole assembly into its maw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"G-GUARDS!" The Deepdowner hollered— a reasonable reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HOLD!" Whurforlüm thankfully rescinded the Deepdowner's demand. Gwen fought down the heebie-jeebies wrecking her chest. She could act out because last night, Hanmoul had gifted the Sen-infused Maotai to his teacher, curing the old Dwarf of his rheumatism. It was an unseen debt, and now the Guild Master was using the encounter to repay her unsolicited favour. When the old Dwarf met her eyes, she knew that now and in the future, her insolence would be tolerated just once. "Magus Song, I believe you've made your point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your monster is no match for our Balefire Dreadnaughts!" Brumdahr growled from beside Ollie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps," Whurforlüm pronounced mockingly from up on high. "But will you consign your Spirit to the Ancestors to empower it, or will a younger kin volunteer? The theme of honour's tongue, indeed!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whurforlüm! You would side with a Surfacer?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do not have 'sides' Brugal," Whurforlüm's voice carried a tone of retribution. "You wear away our patience, boy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brugal swallowed his next words. Behind him, the table of Clan Heads suddenly found great interest in staring at their lap. The Noble caste may shout at the warriors or holler at the Overlanders, but an Engineseer's words, and a Grand Master's at that, carried supreme weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caliban, return!" Gwen quickly withdrew the Void mana pumping into Caliban, though there was no salvaging the spent vitality. With a whine, her Void Wyrm shrivelled, then disappeared. Her complexion paled. Where the Big Bird form was demanding but efficient, the Wyrm form was sheer gluttony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just so we're clear," Gwen walked down the granite tier and stepped carefully into the middle of the amphitheatre. "I don't need your HDMs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THUNK!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She dropped a crate worth at minimum five-thousand, splattering the lowly seated audience with Cali-goo. Instantly, the atmosphere grew thick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THUNK! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;THUNK! THUNK! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;THUNK! THUNK! THUNK!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vapour grew so dense as to paint the cold stone, affecting a luminous hue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is… ten, twenty more stacks in the piggy," Gwen made a show of walking around the stockpile flashing her Storage Ring. "And countless more lodes are resting beneath Manipur, Kachin and Nagaland, awaiting my beck and call."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated on the steps, Ollie and Brugal sat beside one another, both with their nostrils flaring, sucking in the mana-rich fog. The Praelector's eyes were bloodshot, while the Dwarven noble's hypertension made his fingers tremble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you see." Gwen brushed a sticky strand of Caliban's mucus from her Magus' mantle. "I bring you neither doom nor gloom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the Guild Master, she bowed her head. "To Midlord Ironførge and the Rotary Guild, I bring the winds of change to dispel the air of stagnancy that has shrouded Eth Rjoth Kjangtoth for three decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, she faced the Clan Head sitting like ducks in a semi-circle row. "To you, my lords— I am an investment, one that will bring your people and your Citadel unfathomable fortunes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, she turned to the Deepdowners. "And to my friends of the deep, you denizens of Deepholm. I promise hope, hearth and home, down below the Misty Mountains cold…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NAE—" The Deepdowner stood, no longer willing to let her do as she pleased. The Runes on his armour blazed red, orange and ochre even as Gwen readied her double-glazed mana shield. Had she failed? Gwen cursed internally. Maybe the HDMs were too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CLUNK!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dwarf stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second Deepdowner, the one who had sat beside the gravel-voiced gruff, struck the first so hard that his helmet almost cracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Argh!" To Gwen's surprise, the stricken Deepdowner, rather than retaliate, retreated a step before dropping to one knee. "A-Apologies, Lord Engineseer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen raised an arched brow. An Engineseer and a Deepdowner? The leader of the trio of fishbowl-wannabes must be gifted indeed. More curious was the fact that even among Deepdowners there existed such a difference in prestige. Hilda had given the impression that the folk-below were a monastic order of Lore Keepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the leader of the Deepdowners rose, the entourage behind her shrunk away, either bowing or falling to one knee. From the patterns on the master-crafted armour, Gwen recognised the individual. She had seen this very Deepdowner coming into the Citadel observing her from the parapets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Master Whurforlüm has said, it is not our role to interfere." A pleasant, melodious female voice reverberated through the chamber, one that was acutely familiar to Gwen's ears. "Well said, Magus Song."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen blinked. She recognised the voice, she realised, though she had been banking that her bather-companion was either the Thane of the Citadel or at worst, a wife or daughter. Never in her wildest dreams could she have imagined that she could charm a Deepdowner while tits-up in a sauna. "Strewth… Hildy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your gift of gab is almost as pleasant as the Ancestor Scald, Billelynn Møsvian." Hilda's projected voice grew mirthful. "You have my vote, Sorceress. I'll be watching and waiting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mistress…" Hilda's Deepdowner attendant rose in surprise. "The Human—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ebren, another complaint and you will be joining the craftsmen we're lending to Miss Song. Imagine that, brother, strolling in Himmseg under a cavern without a ceiling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his mistress' rebuke, Ebren broke like a rusted factory spring. His containment suit seemed to shrink as the Dwarf within deflated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hilda!" Gwen called after the Deepdowner, stepping out of Caliban's muck. "Can we have a word?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she wanted to know was if their encounter had been serendipity, or if the Deepdowner had sought her out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In time, we shall speak again in Dyar Morkk's vaulted corridors." Hilda was already half-way down the hall. In a moment, her entourage enclosed around the Deepdowner, cutting off the sight of Hilda's lumbering armour. "I would be disappointed, Magus Song, if that day does not come to pass. You bluster well, but I hope your actions speak louder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/WZkxC3a.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen, what's happening?" Ollie watched his fingers jitter while he circulated mana to bring the feeling back into his toes. Up ahead, Gwen rode in a separate Strider with Hanmoul while Ollie himself sat next to a grinning Grimgal. Since leaving Red Peak, he had wondered how he would explain the occurrences to Lady Grey, and what Peterhouse would think of their newest position as a noted ally of the Dwarves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their sockets, his eyeballs felt heavy and swollen. There was an indescribable ache in his belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why hadn't Lady Loftus told him that Gwen was the heiress to a Dragon's hoard? That she carried more HDMs on her person than the ancestral vault of Baronettes? If only the lady would laugh and tell him that Gwen was, in reality, a polymorphic Dragon playing silly buggers in the mortal world. And that speech she gave! The way she whipped the Dwarven noble until the poor sod's face imprinted in the granite, the way she peeled back his 'honour' until the man was stark naked and shivering in the limelight of mockery and laughter…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ollie shivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could he, a second son from the hills, really steer this Dragoness toward propriety? Was it possible for a man to tame a Displacer Beast? Can a Cabal of Wizards herd Drakes? What if she thought him too fussy and decided to put him through the same crucible? Would there be enough blood left in his shame-wrung body to keep his heart beating? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"You just keep doing your job, Ollie," Gwen's Message came back with a hint of mirth. "I think we did rather well, don't you think? New trade route, new allies, new staff, a whole region opened up for adventuring. All in a day's work, eh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please don't say 'we'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't be shy, Ollie. I couldn't have done it without you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No-no-no," Ollie moaned. The fluttering in his diaphragm was getting worse. He felt sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You were my moral support, you know; we're like a... dynamic duo. I knew you had my back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lady Grey will be so pleased."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gwen, I am begging you…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're my guy, Oz."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ollie groaned, vexing Grimgal, who disliked men who couldn't keep their liquor, or their nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stone bread trouble?" she asked with a hint of sarcasm. "It goes down hard and comes out like a high-grit grinder. Is your bung—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grimgal's passenger shook his head, hugged his knees in the cramped cabin, then stared out at the woodlands swishing by as the Striders pounded through the trail. Ollie Edwards, Magus and Praelector of Peterhouse, had been homesick for London since the first day they drank Dwarven Rum. Now, he wished he had stowed a bottle away to drink away his consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">487846</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 08:46:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Metaworld Chronicles - Chapter 342 - Friends for Hire</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/485929</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The next day, a refreshed Hanmoul, buoyed by the Essence from Sen-sen, took Gwen and the hung-over Ollie around the Citadel on the Vularm transports, riding the mechanical caterpillars throughout the four districts. The entire journey, Ollie remained tight-lipped, utilising every ounce of will to stay respectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Citadel, perhaps due to its vertical space, was deceptively compact, taking up little more space than the central Business District in Shanghai. From rim to rim, the largest dome stretched over twenty kilometres, sans the stalactites, with the furthermost edge an ever-expanding pockmark of unfinished construction eating into the mountain's interior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Craftsmen's quarter, at her behest, she met a group of potential future employees in the form of Runesmiths and Tunesmiths, the Dwarven variation of Manufactorium Mages. A Runesmith specialised in the inscription of Glyphs, the foundation of Dwarven magic, while a Tuner, Gwen surmised, was akin to a mechatronic-engineer. Naturally, it took both specialisations to empower the constructs that turned the cog of the Dwarven industry. Upon further enquiry, those having attained mastery of both forms of Runecraft were called "Engineseer", or the antiquated title of "Mötorserumm", one who communes with machines. Other titles and professions existed as well, though the Machinists she wished to hire would hail from the principle ranks of Dwarven professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, within the Craftsmen's Quarter, Gwen observed a strict hierarchy. The younger, bright-eyed Dwarves coming from notable Clans made up the bulk of the apprentice-tier craftsmen, asking after their Masters like ducklings. Once deemed sufficiently skilled, the next tier was the attainment of a "Journeymen" licence. The problem was that with the Dyar Morkk out of commission, there was no real "journey" to be had. As such, graduates generally apprenticed for another decade or so, emerging as mechanics capable of independent, unsupervised labour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a sizeable Dwarven stronghold, the Peak thankfully retained its share of Masters and Grand Masters of the craft. According to Hanmoul, the smaller enclaves cut off by the Murk had no such luck, meaning eventually, without the unlikely emergence of an anomalously talented individual, crafts and innovations stagnated forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of necessity, therefore, Hanmoul explained, Craftsmen were paramount in influence and respect in the Murk. Warriors like himself were hailed as heroes but paled in comparison to a Grandmaster. An Engineseer's work could power the entire city's fleet of Golems, or expand the city's arable food-shafts three-fold as a result of a new crop or an energy-efficient way to maintain the hydroponic systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceptive as always, Gwen steered the conversation toward the Deepdowners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aye, yer ken. For the same reason, the Deepdowners eh held in high esteem. As Deepholm's elite, they exist at the apex of both knowledge and talent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gwen asked if Hanmoul used the word "Talent" as the Human's do, citing her dual-elements, the Commandrumm nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those deemed with 'talent' inherit their gifts from the Seven Ancestors," Hanmoul explained as they strode down the open avenues of the Craft Quarter. There were workshops as far as the eye could see, though much to Gwen's disappointment, the shopkeepers cared little for items suitable for Humans Mages. Most sold ready-made parts, such as Mana Engines, or a Flux Capacitor, or something that looked like a vehicle battery, or Spellsword blades, or parts for other Workshop's creations. "Rarely ay one of us Murk-folk borne blessed. It happens much mair frequently in the awld Clans, especially in Deepholm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You said all of you could Stoneshape to some degree." Gwen clattered alongside the Iron Born in her Mary Janes. Clad in her Magus mantle, she looked every inch the Cambridge-graduated sorceress she imitated. The Dwarves, Ollie explained, saw the ermine-lined robe as equivalent to the attire of a Master, if not in craft or skill, then at least in terms of power and influence. "Ergo, all Dwarves are talented in Earthen-magic?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The difference ay enormous." Hanmoul nodded. "We're scions of the Earth Mother, after all, and the Plane is mighty vast. Maybe I can demonstrate…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dwarf looked around the shopfronts, then picked up a detached rod of iron. Holding the rusty pole in front of Gwen, he twisted the metal until it formed the shape of a pretzel. "There. A small gift from Bürumm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen hefted the iron pretzel with both hands. If she had the Yinglong's Draconic Essence, perhaps she could have managed to twist the metal. Presently, however, the rod remained un-malleable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amazing." Gwen returned the sample. "I think I am starting to understand why we haven't 'stolen' much else from your people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she meant was that in all the Workshops she had visited, there were particular skills, talents, methods and applications unbefitting the one-mould-fits-all practice of production preferred by human industries. The rare Human Mage may mimic the Dwarve's magic, but the masses couldn't possibly achieve the same tier of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, most of the workshops were akin to mid-sized outfitters crafting custom parts for high-octane racers. The majority of the craftsmen were employed by the Guild, which served as a central body for commissions. Others worked as individual contractors, with certain specialists attaining an essential status. The scale and size of the operations were far below Gwen's expectations but made sense when considering that the Citadel held half-a-million Dwarves at best, barely the size of a mid-range Human metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen received a second confirmation at the Mana Engine workshop ran by Master Rostrum Luggcrann, the supplier for Hanmoul's Striders. While she watched in silence, Gwen bore witness to the Dwarf sticking his hand, unprotected, into a bubbling vat of heated metal, moulding the engine frame not through precision machinery, but the mind. Components that would have required CAD software, machine beds and CNC cutters in her world had all been bypassed by intuition and "Talent".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional factor, Ollie reminded Gwen as she pondered the nature of Dwarven industry, was that Dwarves lived long lives— almost four-times an NoM's and twice that of a fully provisioned Mage. Sans industrial accidents, the Craftsmen were seldom in danger, meaning most Apprentices could hope to reach the stage of a Master in their second century. The Citadel's premier Grand Master of Runes, Master Grouzumin Zur-Himlegg, was in his fourth century and kept hale enough to drink two-century-old peers under the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lunch, the trio stopped at an artisanal street for food. Though more than half of the cramped boulevard consisted of craft-beer and spirt-mixers, dozens of families had taken up the enterprise of improving Dwarven cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Meat Smokers?" Gwen was surprised to find, of all things, a Journeyman chef engaged in the act of smoking an enormous side of Mud-land Iguana. "And hickory too!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aye. We have got a keen interest for certain things on the Surface world," Hanmoul confessed. "Especially when it comes to scran. Stone-bread is…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commandrumm made a face that suggested he wished he still had all of his original molars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Demi-folk with creation origins rooted in the Elemental Plane of Earth, the Dwarves could subsist on native produce, such as the lichen and fungi that proliferated in the Murk. When ground down and baked, the product was a nigh indigestible pane de "stone". When appropriately stowed, the bread kept indefinitely, growing more inedible with time, so much that one look at an old loaf was enough to curb all hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Murk folk had first turned to the surface for quality of life improvements, one was the ever-present hydroponic systems that had replaced the moss and lichen harvests of yore. Culinary pursuits by renegade cooks had even introduced the nouveau profession of "Chef"— one that was met with considerable success in citadels all over Dwarf-land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the lizard was greasing their insides, the tour continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the way, Gwen paid explicit attention to a particular technology she wished to appropriate for her operations— a Dwarven Magitech known as Echo or "repeater" Glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her behest, Hanmoul took the pair to tour the Avenue of Cunning Artificers, a section of the Western Craftsmen's Quarter that specialised in Rune-tuning, magical accessories and machine-components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Workshop they chose to visit was owned by Braem Yufir-Flaskthane, a lady-crafter with a century of experience under her considerable girth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're after old tech pioneered by Grand Master Khazül-Dal Bhordodd, of Deepholm." The boisterous Tuner was happy to entertain Gwen's acute curiosity. "Of course, the proviso is that yer's got a lode of Taveir to spare…" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a storage box with indefinite dimensions, Braem materialised two nondescript looking crystals. Each was inscribed with complex Glyphs in Dwarven Runescript. Tapping a few invisible Glyphs only she could see, the artificer activated the left-most crystal, lighting up a pattern of Runes. A split-second later, a corresponding set of Runes glowed on the adjacent gem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more refined the crystal, the more clarified the pulse, the greater the distance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How rare are these Taveir Crystals?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rarer than Mithril in these parts." Braem's words made her wince. "The motherlode's in Deepholm. In the old days, we could order Vularm-trams of the stuff to be delivered. Now? We're substituting whatever we can scrap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Which is?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Creature Cores." The Master Tuner shrugged. "Inconsistent as anything, yer ken. But it's the best a Tuner can do under the circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How so?" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Tier, Element, clarity, battle-damage, supply, ye name it." The crafter shrugged. "O how I yearn for the days when we could receive a crate of two hundred identical stones from the same lode…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen took notes, committing the knowledge to memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to their verbose Tuner, the Taveir crystal's unique properties were empowered by resonator Glyphs. By likewise inscribing Creature Cores, a "poor Dwarf's" sympathetic resonance could be achieved across distance and space, potentially even Planes. The problem was consistency, for each pair was unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this manner, the Dwarves maintained their equivalent of Divination Towers. To Gwen, the kit was akin to a magical form of Morse Code. The difference that was a skilled operator could add a near-infinite level of complexity, pending skill and materials. Additionally, paired with specially made equipment, it was possible to transmute the resonance into voice and vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem for Gwen, alas, was that "D-Tech" was highly dependent on Dwarven artisans. Whether or not a human manufactorium could reproduce the same effect remained anyone's guess. For her ambitions, therefore, D-Tech held both strength and weaknesses. The boon being she could have an exclusive, difficult to replicate operation— while the bane was that her supply-chain was highly dependent on volatile, inter-racial politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't as though she lacked countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially, the technical hurdle could be lowered if say, a Dragon Prince were to supply quality Cores from Nagaland, Kachin and Manipur or Huangshan. Likewise, she needn't begin with voice or vision. Texting would suffice for phase one. Hell, a Pager system would work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, she could commission Magisters to unravel or appropriate the tech. It wasn't as though Dwarven-magic specialists did not exist. Even Petra confessed that the progenitor of her Spellcubes sourced their inspiration from Dwarven Runic Magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she proposed purchasing the Magi-tech, however, the Master Tuner broke into a high-pitched, snorting laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fool lass! Yer grasping at the Phantom of Thul-Dâr! Hahaha…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Guild can supply you with Echo Beacons," Hanmoul explained, a little red-faced. "But the Guild of Artificers cannot teach you the Glyphs or the Runes. Whatever tech that belongs to, and is derived from, the grand teachings of the Ancestors belong to Deepholm. Only the Council of Seven can authorise such an audacious transaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Could I make a petition?" Gwen smiled, thinking of Ruxin's hoard. How many more HDMs had now accumulated from the Tonglv project? "I can be very convincing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanmoul politely coughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had scant contact with Deepholm since the Murk became flooded," the Commandrumm said. "You won't even be able to make a petition, lass."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no one who can authorise a barter for the betterment of the Citadel?" Gwen extended her enquiry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"No one would dare unless yer count the Deepdowners trapped here with us." Hanmoul shook his head. "Braem's right, though. There's no graspin' for Thul-Dâr's Phantoms. It would take a supreme act to move their stone hearts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe if yer cod clear the way to Deepholm." The Master Tuner laughed at the Surfacers' expense. "Then one of them could just be desperate enough to shoulder the reprimand and the responsibility of hawk'n the Ancestor's Craft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You would have to convince our Thane as well. Without Deepdowner support, he won't act either." Hanmoul gestured to the gate, under which sat the Keep, a fortress-within-a-fortress that housed Eth Rjoth Kjangtoth's elected leader, the foremost Dwarf among the Clans. "It donnae be Vadam."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But you can lend me personnel as well as sell me ready-made goods?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That the Guild can manage on its own, och aye." Hanmoul nodded. "We traded with humans before. Yer should cont yer luck that despite the grudge between our folk, there was nae directive from Deepholm to cut commerce. It won't be easy. First, you would have to convince the caravaneers. Most of them haven't ventured out in decades, much less traversed the surface. They're staying thrang just keeping the surrounding settlements supplied."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen looked at Ollie, who nodded back that Hanmoul was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How interesting," she muttered. "Right then. Shall we visit the lower regions?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen could see that Hanmoul was ambivalent about her desire to see the Dwarven equivalent of the slums, but relented after Gwen explained that she wanted to see all of the city, not just the prosperous parts. What Gwen withheld from the Iron Born was that how a culture valued the most vulnerable was a key determinant for market viability. Her's wasn't a metric for morality; instead, she was taught to structure a business around a society's strata. In countries where corruption wasn't so much a disease but natural gut-fauna, bribes were an investment expense. In nations where the Rule of Law held sway, agencies took their cut, but also provided guidelines and assurances. When in the past, she had advised for an Australian mining firm looking to expand in Bangladesh, half the expense usually for environmental protection had fattened the local councilmen. What was legal and what was ethical were entirely separate matters. In the holistic pursuit of profit, altruism was a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When their multi-segmented Vularm approached the working-class district called the Foundry, she immediately had flashbacks of Blackheath. She even felt a shiver when they stepped into the smog-filled suburb, where endless storeys of favela-structures made up the cavern's walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As before, Gwen became the immediate centre of attention. The Dwarven Citadel wasn't small by any means, but it was compact, which meant rumours spread like an aftershock. Anyone who kept their ear to the ground knew of the Human Sorceress who had consumed a Shale Wyrm. All who now laid eyes on the giantess wondered if she brought destruction or salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Gwen's studied eyes, the workers' conditions were leagues improved to what she had seen in Burma, and certainly better than the treatment of the dock labourers on the isle. For one, the teams of Dwarves manning the sky-scraper foundries all wore codified uniforms with protective Runes to shield them from the heat. There was OSHA, certainly, and the workers also appeared, at least on the surface, to be hale and enthusiastic about their work. If she had to present the atmosphere in familiar terms, she would cite case-studies of pre-Reagan Steel Belt. Whether as a result of propaganda or culture, the workers here had pride in their work and understood the essential nature of their labour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How's their upward mobility?" Gwen waved at the workers, who averted her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They move well enough." Hanmoul pointed to the carts and pulleys powered by thrumming mana engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I mean their career mobility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aye..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she looked to her companion, Hanmoul remarked with sagacity that such was the difference between those who lived by the work of hands besides those with craft and talent, one may be comparing dirt and Mithril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevermind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If yer mean better jobs, we recruit Guards from here." The Commandrumm nodded back to the workers. "Some talents aren't gifted by the Ancestor's blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like riding the Golems." Hanmoul grinned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's true…" Gwen fell silent. She recalled hearing that the American IIUC teams used NoMs as pilots for their custom-made Iron Golems. As someone who came from the working class, she knew not to underestimate dedication driven by a desperate desire to escape mediocrity. As for the central continent, Hanmoul likely referred to the Bavarian Clans, who had not only worked but lived alongside the Human settlements in lower Germany. "You don't use autonomous Golems?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Machine Souls are Vadam!" Hanmoul lowered his voice; his skin flushed two shades darker. "The Ancestors have forbidden such a thing!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right, right." Gwen quickly changed the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tour of the Foundry District took the rest of the afternoon. The group furthermore visited the mine shafts, as well as a system of ventilators that connected to the outside world. These, Gwen guessed correctly, were the source of the giant mana-plumes that she had twice almost flown into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supper involved more roasted richness. This time, Gwen recognised the sickly-rich bread underneath the whole-animal roast as the infamous stone-bread. Despite soaking in saturated fat and smoke-cooked for up to ten hours, the discus bread's nutritional value remained immutable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following another round of riotous quaffing, one from which Ollie abstained, the Mages retired to their quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearing the witching hour, Gwen informed Ollie of her plans for the steam bath, leaving her Praelector red-faced and pale-lipped at the jocular invitation. This time, she checked that the chamber was unoccupied before stepping into the all-enveloping waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comfortable in the liquid-womb of the mana-rich water, she spent some time absorbing the sights of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foremost of all, she desired the Dwarven technology known as the Echo Beacons, as well as the Runic Glyphs that made the "signal repeaters" possible. By that same measure, she wasn't so naive to think that she would maintain a monopoly on Dwarven-tech for long. Once her profits came in, the technology behind the Towers would undoubtedly be copied and imitated. But— she wasn't worried. Her plans for Project Legion did not crutch on patented technology, but instead the arcane system she would devise with the help of data-tech, NoM employees, the House of M's Centurion program, and Gunther and Lady Grey's word with the Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of a seemingly unique Magi-tech system, therefore, would leave a Shoggoth-sized red-herring for her future competitors. Without a doubt, they would misplace their methodologies, resulting in investments both futile and fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After which, she could snap up cheap assets like freshly picked legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was the matter of the Machinists, of whom she desired a dozen, split between Runesmiths and Tuners. Hanmoul had said that hiring a Master was possible through short-lease. The contract would last a stone-cycle, a geo-synchronised measurement closely matching the Gregorian calendar. Additionally, she was confident that among the isle, there were Human tinkerers skilled enough to absorb enough of Dwarven knowledge to maintain the machines once their stout tutors inevitably returned to their Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow was their third day in the Guild. Hanmoul had promised a careful look at the lands surrounding the Dwarven Bastion, as well as a gander at the different types of Golems in the Hammer Guard's armoury. Gwen had rolled her eyes when Ollie made the request but allowed the Praelector the freedom of making his bed. She had half a mind to pass Hanmoul a note under the table, but then again, Ollie was right in that the Dwarves were Demi-humans and not something like an oppositional Human nation. Should the inconsequential matter escalate, what would happen to her plans for Evee and Legion? Did that make her a bad friend and a worse partner? She chose not to dwell on the hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SHURRRK—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sucking sound of the pressurised door opening and closing announced the arrival of a late-night bather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen had wondered if her companion would return, and to her delight, she did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Magus Song?" The voice called out in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hildy. I am happy you've returned." In consideration of her new friend, she had dimmed the lights to their lowest setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And so I have." From Hilda's tone, the Dwarven noblewoman had been expecting her as well. "Shall we continue our conversation? I have since grown curious about the surface. Can you tell me more about the profession known as Adventurers? And thank you for the jadeite. As you have surmised, we are indeed interested in its many properties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course." Gwen parted the steam with a wave of her hand. "But first, would you like to meet my Familiars? They're simply adorable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="50" src="https://i.imgur.com/fWXKvex.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" width="292"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, against all the odds and to Ollie's complete surprise, their tour of the hydroponic farms and mining pits proceeded without encountering a single Magical Creature for Gwen to devour. The lack of action was so unanticipated that, by the end of the four-hour route, the unmitigated tension had exhausted the Praelector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen, conversely, appeared deep in thought since the patrol began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ollie asked what she was worried about, the sorceress simply replied that she was thinking about how to best approach Whurforlüm about her request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, Ollie offered advice based on humility and delicacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter how much you desire funds for Elvia," the Praelector proposed with great understanding. "Don't offend. Know your limits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And what limit is that?" Gwen gave her companion the strangest look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"… ten thousand HDMs?" Ollie scratched his head. The Illusionist was doing that a lot in recent days, so much that Gwen could see his hair thinning in real-time. "I am sure they have vast reserves of it leftover from the pre-Tide days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDMs? Gwen restrained herself from patting Ollie like a puppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now elucidated by her midnight tuition, Gwen understood that the enclaves used human currency because of an unexpected schism following the Beast Tide. It all began pre-Dragon, with Humanities' Spellcraft Revolution. Against the advice of the Deepdowners, many of the Murk Citadels chose to trade with Humans, greatly accelerating the development of Spellcraft while enormously enriching themselves. Post-Dragon, cut off and geologically displaced from Deepholm, the enclaves either shut themselves away or opened up new avenues of trade with their Surfacer neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior, Dwarven currency, consisting principally of gold, Elementium, Adamantium, and precious metals like Mithril and True Silver, were minted exclusively by the Masters of the Iron Vault in Deepholm. In the decade that followed the Murk's spread, Thanes of various enclaves diluted their coins, resulting in economic chaos among the Clans. Following the near-collapse of the Murk's currency, as a compromise, the surface Clans agreed to switch to Human HDMs. It was a sound choice, as many Citadels lacking in resources now relied on Overland trade for raw materials. Concurrently, as Humans had little to no interest in expanding underground, the young race made perfect trading partners thanks to their greed for elemental minerals. In some places such as Bavaria, the two tribes even shared common racial enemies in the form of Green Skins and Magical Monsters that traversed the Overland and the Murk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their present enclave, Eth Rjoth Kjangtoth, was a regional power wealthy enough to minimise contact with the Humans after the perceived betrayal of trust. It's current Guild Master wished to test the waters of tentative trading— while the conservative faction headed by the Deepdowners were dead-set against being tainted by the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tug-of-war as old as time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their exchange, her bathing buddy had advised that the conservative Clans were deeply ingrained in the teachings of the Deepdowners, believing Dwarf-kind diminished by the disconnect between Deepholm and the Murk. For many of the White Beards, the quintessence of Dwarvishness lay in completing one's pilgrimage to the origin city to kiss the sarcophagi at the bases of the Seven Shrines of the Ancestors. For many of the Citadel's craftsmen, they still recalled the golden halls of Deepholm, its glimmering galleries adorned with jewels the size of Dragon eggs, and the monuments of Grand Masters adorned with plated Mithril. To the true Dwarf, not having touched the Blackened Forge of Gul-Zūh or inhaled the bitter air surrounding Nörn-Zur's Crucible made one deficient. If a smith never laid eyes on the original artifice of Haj-Zül, then how would they measure their craft? If a Tuner had never been dazzled by the ten-thousand scripts of Varekan-Kül, how would they know mastery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only the young like Grimgal and Tordok who thought the stories of Deepholm a fool's errand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen had nodded in turn after Hilda unravelled the intricacies of Dwarven lore. Against all the odds, she sympathised with the zeitgeist of Hilda's lost people. Like the Biblical Magi of old, having followed the Northern Star and seen the divine body of Christ in Bethlehem, how could the pilgrims return to their countries in peace? What riches, what pleasures, what palaces could bring them peace of mind when they had witnessed the Nazarene cooing for milk? Without Deepholm, the learned Dwarves of the Murk were lambs without Shepards, living in guilt every day they grew diverted from their objective. Conversely, as the young struggled to understand their elder's obsession, the diaspora only grew. It was no wonder that Hanmoul's love of the surface and the deep made him a little schizophrenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To open up Eth Rjoth Kjangtoth, thereby, Gwen would first have to convince those whose modus was to delve deeper towards the low-ways. In the Murk, progress upwards had to be precipitated by advancement downwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, Gwen had informed her bathing buddy that few things moved humanity like unmitigated profit. If the Citadel had made little meaningful progress on its own in the last three decades, why not seek external aid? Given enough incentive, legions of Adventurers would flood the Murk to harvest the Dwarves' foes and open new byways. So long as the residents of Eth Rjoth Kjangtoth were willing to accept expatriates in their midst, the potential for cooperation was limitless. In truth, what had the Dwarves to lose? It wasn't as though Humans could inhabit the Murk; the claustrophobia alone would drive her kind mad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her companion said nothing, but Gwen could see the bolts spinning into place behind Hilda's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the night's end, the noblewoman still hadn't informed Gwen of her true identity. Gwen remained mum, knowing better than to demand something her helpful tutor refused to give freely. Already, Hildy had told her plenty— enough for her to drive a good bargain with the Guild Master and to ensure that she had plenty of Dwarves manning the printing press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, that was enough. &lt;br/&gt;After all, not even Rome was transmuted in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">485929</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 10:57:37 GMT</pubDate></item></channel><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/syndication/14167</link><description>Latest updates of (Metaworld Chronicles)</description></rss>
