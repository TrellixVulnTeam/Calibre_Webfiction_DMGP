Promise (5)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-335</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The beam of light that shot out of Raging Temperance's mouth fully engulfed Twisted Kindness and pierced through the sky. Looking from afar, one would mistakenly think that a giant pillar of light was erected in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;KIAAAAAAAAAA!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-pitched scream that seemed to tear apart the fabric of space erupted. It was Twisted Kindness' scream, without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, Raging Temperance under Divine Manifestation was not an opponent that could be looked down on. Setting aside the side-effect unique to him and comparing only the difference in their energy's league, he was not far behind Twisted Kindness. Moreover, Twisted Kindness was struck without being able to make proper preparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, by the time that the pillar of light slowly faded away and the cluster of light dyeing the air white subsided, what Seol Jihu witnessed was Twisted Kindness swaying down like a willow branch shaking in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not fall straight down. She was trying to desperately steady herself, but she fell constantly while drawing a gradual arc like a butterfly with a torn wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tak.&lt;/em&gt; Her left foot touched the ground, and she immediately swayed in a big motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chiiik!&lt;/em&gt; White steam rose up from her heated body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeeeeeu—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her miserable state was already a sight to see, but her heavily panting face was even more of a spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her previous dignified expression was nowhere to be seen. Her proud pupils had disappeared leaving only the sclera behind; it looked like she had gone mad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, her slowly swaying body halted. Twisted Kindness had balanced herself by just barely planting her foot on the ground. Her half-tilted body trembled, and her eyes came into focus again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kuk, kuhuk, kuhuuuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was the injury she suffered that severe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness coughed as if even breathing was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kuuhhhhh…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, she finally managed to straighten her back, but—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kwang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she saw when she stood back up was a giant breaking the earth wall and charging toward her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising his foot back, Raging Temperance kicked Twisted Kindness as though she was a soccer ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pang!&lt;/em&gt; Before she could collect herself, Twisted Kindness was sent flying into the sky. Scattering a large amount of fresh blood in the air, she quickly cut through the sky and became a dot in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flying endlessly, she broke through dozens of trees, boulders, and other terrain features before hitting a large cliff and coming to a stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Koong!&lt;/em&gt; Twisted Kindness' back curved like a bow. Streams of blood burst out of her nose and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Cough! Cough!&lt;/em&gt; Wuuuuuuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coughing violently, she shot open her eyes. Perhaps because of the powerful impact, her faint consciousness became clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Koong, koong, koong, koong.&lt;/em&gt; She raised her eyes as soon as she heard the rumbling earth. Looking at the giant stomping toward her, her face contorted with rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yoooooooouuu…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A curdling voice rang out, and her pupils seethed along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that things had come to this, Twisted Kindness decided it was a do-or-die situation. Though she wasn't sure what happened, she decided that Raging Temperance was no longer her ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fool! Don't you know you are being toyed with by these insects!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing Raging Temperance, who had already shortened the distance and was pulling his hand back, she clutched her twin swords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fine! If that is what you want, I will play along with your farce!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alarming shockwave pulsated out from Twisted Kindness. With her twin swords carving the way, she shot forward like a bolt of lightning. In an instant, the twin swords clashed with the titanic, towering fist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euuuuuuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Krrrrrrrrrrr!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two energies entered a fierce tug of war. The cluster of light spreading out in all directions illuminated the surroundings as if the sun had descended, and the terrain features that could not withstand the clashing energies shattered into dust and scattered away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the surrounding area turned into a strange landscape that lacked a single landmark and even blocked out all sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this fierce clash, in which neither side lost out, continued, Twisted Kindness' twin swords advanced forward ever so slightly. In the next moment, Twisted Kindness let out a roar and shook her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the intersecting twin swords cut down diagonally, Raging Temperance's energy split apart, revealing a gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fierce energy filling the surroundings vanished out of the blue. The giant's titanous body slanted, and Raging Temperance took a step back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness had surprisingly suppressed the rampaging Raging Temperance with her strength!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And not missing out on this gap, she rushed in like a tiger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slash!&lt;/em&gt; Raging Temperance's thick arm was cut off like tofu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lowly creature of the Spiritual Dimension dares to contend with me!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness shot up to the sky. Although she planned to ride this momentum to behead Raging Temperance—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she swung her longsword, her eyes shot open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance's body had expanded before she noticed, and it was looking like it would blow up at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woooong, wooong!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An explosive aura flowed out from its body as well. Doing a double-take, Twisted Kindness hurriedly spread her wings and flew back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Raging Temperance's body expanded even more and radiated a blinding light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kwang, kwang, kwang, kwang, kwang, kwang, kwang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light shot out into all directions like falling stars and exploded without distinguishing between heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eeeeeeuuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was clearly a desperate, do-or-die attack neglecting the safety of its user! Given Raging Temperance's identity as a Darkshini, it would not be unharmed after using so much energy at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an attack that put its user's life at risk worthily carried immense power. Even Twisted Kindness had no choice but to clench her teeth and move out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same applied to the expedition team. The aftereffects of the mindless Raging Temperance's attack flooded over to their vicinity. Although it was only a small aftershock, even this had enough power to annihilate several dozen people with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Watch out!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the shockwave shattered the earth wall and came crashing in, Seo Yuhui immediately scraped up her power to cast a barrier. She was a legend of Paradise and also one of the only two Level 8s. Worthy of her title as the greatest Priest, she managed to block the shockwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even that was only temporary. Soon, the barrier began to shake noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do… something…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Yuhui clenched her teeth while sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller quickly chanted a spell. A magic circle floated up from his book and surrounded the expedition team in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only after moving back via Teleport did the expedition team breathe a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Whew….'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu also relaxed a bit, but he became lost for words when he looked back to the front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heaven and earth were shaking from the torrential rain of light. After carpet-bombing the entire area, the light exploded in its entirety and created a mushroom-shaped cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu could not take his eyes off this chilling scene. In a way, this was their perfect moment to slay Twisted Kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he soon erased this thought from his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It's impossible…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A battle between two divine beings was occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The life-or-death battle of two gods was far beyond the comprehension of any mortal beings. Not just heaven and earth, but even the very fabric of space was being torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world was quite literally blowing up. Interfering in a battle of such scale was out of the question. Not when one wrong move or one minor accident could easily seal fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pang!&lt;/em&gt; Along with a powerful explosion, Seol Jihu caught sight of Twisted Kindness being knocked back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeeeuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tumbled on the ground before gritting her teeth. She ended up being hit just as she was about to escape the range of Raging Temperance's attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing up just barely, she scowled at the scorching pain tearing through her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This couldn't continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't that she believed she would lose. However, Raging Temperance was attacking relentlessly without a care for the aftermath while she was in a position where she had no choice but to dodge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had to think about the expedition team, and more importantly, she had to keep in mind the World Tree that was growing at a frightening rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disadvantageous. The situation was simply too disadvantageous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This can't go on.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time for her to make a decision had come. Although she knew she shouldn't, the situation was forcing her to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment she thought so in her subconscious mind, Twisted Kindness' eyes widened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forced? I am being forced?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had never felt anything like this. Not only since the moment she received her divinity, but since the moment she hatched out of her egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Koong, koong, koong.&lt;/em&gt; Raging Temperance charged in without giving her a chance to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Dammmn ittttt!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Twisted Kindness came to a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She threw the left hand's longsword up to the sky and conversely threw the right hand's longsword down to the ground. The twin swords that left her hands slithered out as though they had a mind of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, something mystical happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longswords melted down and changed into blood-like liquids. Then, they spread out like a drop of paint in a glass of water, and two magic circles filled with incomprehensible symbols were created from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The racing giant passed through the two magic circles at the same time that Twisted Kindness raised her left arm up high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Come! Six Domains of the Desire Realm!"&lt;span id="footnote-ref-4134"&gt;&lt;a href="#footnote-4134"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zzwwooooongg!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sound of the space being cut was heard. Next, the spinning magic circle in the air, dripping with blood, radiated a terrifying blood-light. Then, blood-colored lightning bolts struck down from the vertices of the hexagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—KUAAAAAAAAK!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The giant, charging in like a raging bull, finally stopped. A blood-red electric current flowed through the light enveloping its body, and it convulsed as if it was electrocuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keheuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, a near bucketful of blood spurted out of the shaking Twisted Kindness' mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the magic circle on the ground turned red. Splitting left and right like a monster opening its mouth, it began to suck in the giant like a black hole!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Kua, kua, kuaaa, kuaaaaaa!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance struggled desperately, but it was already being sucked in from its legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heeeeeeeeu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness also gave her all, pushing more of her energy into her two hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Return to the Spiritual Dimension, lowly vermin!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last, the magic circle devoured more than half of the giant's body. What was important was that the black hole only sucked in the internal darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, what Twisted Kindness was trying to do was forcefully separate the two fused energies inside Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening the Six Domains of the Desire Realm where a sixth heaven-rank god resides to trap the divinity, and then opening the door of the Spiritual Realm to return the Darkshini's true body. With this, the divine energy that lost its place should naturally go back to its original state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' guess was spot on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the darkness was sucked in completely, Raging Temperance's aura drastically lost its cohesiveness. Getting smaller bit by bit, it eventually turned into a small spherical object and dropped to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then did Twisted Kindness lower her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, by the time the magic circles disappeared completely, the world regained its silence. The only thing that remained were piles of ashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like looking at a scene after a nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'No way…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's jaw dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a little skeptical as he watched the exchange, but Raging Temperance had really perished and returned to the origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness had triumphed in the end!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, she wasn't in her best condition either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggering side to side, Twisted Kindness dropped to her knee at last. Her body was in such a pitiful state that it would be wrong to describe her as anything but grotesque. She was bleeding from every surface of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, her skin had cracked up like a land wrought with drought, making her look like a being of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, it was to be expected. She had borrowed the power of the Six Domains, which came from the Desire Realm, one of the Three Realms of Samsara. And on top of that, she had forcefully opened the door to the Spiritual Dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of them was a magic spell that went beyond the level of a grand magic, so even an existence of her level was not able to ignore the terrifying recoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, she was prepared for the side-effects ever since she decided to resort to this method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...Ha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitterness appeared on Twisted Kindness' face as she wiped the blood off her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'To think I would be pushed to this extent…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current situation was naturally something she could not have foreseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who was Twisted Kindness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the only Army Commander that the Parasite Queen treated with respect! Being called the strongest Army Commander was not a simple title. Since birth, she was in a different league than the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was a member of the Dragon race, one of the half-god races of the universe. Even among the Dragons of Paradise, she was the strongest one that survived until no other remained!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'How did I end up like this…?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calmly checking her condition even in such a situation, Twisted Kindness made an accurate judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'With this body, it's no longer possible to do anything about the Spirit Realm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be more precise, she had to choose between two options. The first was to turn back, destroy the World Tree before it reached adulthood, and then escape. The second was to ignore the World Tree and kill the expedition team— no, Seol Jihu, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not need to think for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After barely getting up, she gazed at Seol Jihu, who was staring back from a far distance. She knew that destroying the World Tree would help in taking down Tigol Fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Twisted Kindness' scale judged Seol Jihu to be of much greater weight than the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, she did not know why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But having fought him on this day, there was one thing she could be sure about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she let this man escape?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness bit her lower lip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She could not fathom what incredible plans he would carry out in the future, and how much he would grow and hinder the Parasites' plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she decided on her option. However, it wasn't as if she had no hesitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had revealed almost every card in her hand. She still had a final trump card that she did not use, but this also meant having this card stopped would leave her with absolutely zero resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the opponent took out yet another unexpected card….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'No.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness clenched her teeth and shook away the worry rising up in her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I must kill him. That is the right choice no matter what.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a strong feeling that letting this man reach the Queen was the one thing she absolutely could not allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steeling her resolve, Twisted Kindness spread her wings open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu collected his breath as he watched her slowly fly up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I admit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they were a fair distance away, Twisted Kindness' voice rang out in his ear clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did not think I would be pushed to the corner to this extent. So— you can be proud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu furrowed his brows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I can be proud?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly speaking, the expedition team wasn't in a fantastic state either. They had already met their limit when they subjugated the Unicorn. In other words, everyone had surpassed their limits to hold off against Twisted Kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite most members being in a groggy state, their situation was far better than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance had bought them ample time, and it was clear that Twisted Kindness was on her last leg. It might even be possible to kill an additional Army Commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was what Seol Jihu thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a vivacious voice tickled his ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you think you were the only one with a trump card?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes shot open. It was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash!&lt;/em&gt; A brilliant light erupted from the distant sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evenloped by the light, Twisted Kindness' body expanded. However, this was unlike the time with Raging Temperance. Without brewing a violent storm, the light took shape instantly, quietly and noiselessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This showed the perfect degree of control Twisted Kindness had over her divinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final shape was that of a Bone Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the head to the tail, an almost 10-meter-long Dragon made of bones revealed itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"F-Fuck! Another Divinity Release!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria screamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was half right and half wrong. Because Twisted Kindness already had full control over her divinity, releasing her power would not make her divinity increase explosively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the significance lied in the fact that she revealed her true body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Twisted Kindness fought in a human body until now, her real self was a Dragon through and through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans and Dragons had fundamentally different bodies. Now that she transformed, it was only natural that her output would change on a fundamental level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—KUOOOOOOO!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness looked up at the sky and roared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon Roar — a skill demanding obedience from all living beings — rang out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euuuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The members of the expedition team blocked their ears as the world seemed to growl at them. Ultimately, they fell on their butts after much struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the Bone Dragon's hollow eyes flashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"KEUUUAAAAH!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller, who was preparing to use Teleport, abruptly screamed in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mister Philip Muller!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu called out with a grimace, but there was nothing he could do. Philip Muller was convulsing on the ground, crackling with blood-colored electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that wasn't the end. Looking back, Seol Jihu felt a frightening energy gathering in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dragon floating in the air was opening its mouth at the expedition team. And inside it, an inestimable flux of light was being compressed into a sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Seol Jihu realized what it was...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—This is it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kwaaaaaaaa!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge beam of light was already shooting out of the Bone Dragon's mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not touch the ground, but everywhere it passed flared up with colossal flames. The breath of light pounced toward the expedition team as if to incinerate them along with the entire surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beam cut through hundreds of meters in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu did not even think to dodge it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Yuhui jumping in front of him and casting a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Baek Haeju holding him in her embrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu did not perceive either of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He only looked up at the approaching beam of light with an entranced look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whiiiiish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fierce wind blew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's fluttering bangs tickled his eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, something lightly hopped off of his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening the eyes he subconsciously closed, Seol Jihu strained his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had only blinked once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was something in front of him that was not there before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it became translucent, if he was not seeing wrong, it was Little Chick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, Little Chick was flying past Seo Yuhui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'You….'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beam of light rushed closer. Facing this devastating breath, Little Chick spread out its tiny wings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, five colors dyed its tiny body, and it opened its small beak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PPIAAAAAAAAK!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The translucent Little Chick roared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id="footnote-4134"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_realm &lt;a href="#footnote-ref-4134"&gt;&lt;i class="far fa-hand-point-left"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-334"&gt;

Promise (4)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-334</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Let's rewind time by 30 minutes to when Marcel Ghionea was preparing to shoot and Seol Jihu and the rest of the expedition team were stalling for time against Twisted Kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great war in the Middle World was momentarily in a lull.&lt;br/&gt;With the unexpected arrival of humanity's reinforcements, a tense silence descended on Tigol Fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel moved slowly, with much caution. She placed her hands on the fortress wall and stared into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She blinked, yet the distant scenery did not change. In front of her eyes were undoubtedly humanity's mounted troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever their reason may be, humanity had decided to abandon its long-standing impartiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly speaking, she was not expecting the current situation to suddenly change due to the arrival of humanity's reinforcements. She knew that the Parasite's main force was still strong and that the Federation's and humanity's forces were weaker in comparison. This was no secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she couldn't care less about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really mattered was the fact that before it was too late, before the train reached its final destination called despair, humanity had responded to the Federation's request for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…They really came."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel whispered under her breath and clenched her fists. At the same time, a sudden roar of cheers erupted from Tigol Fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Waaaaaaaaaaa!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sky Fairies raised their bows, and Cave Fairies lifted both arms above their heads and cheered. Even the Beastmen joined in, waving their arms up and down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help that arrived when one needed it the most, always felt more personal. With the fortress on the verge of collapse, they were happier than ever to see reinforcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Waaaaaa! Waaaaaa!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their cheers and chants echoed endlessly throughout the silent battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa, who was standing on the mountain ridge, slowly shifted her gaze downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though her initial intention was to assess the situation, when she saw the battlefield, she became speechless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She couldn't be blamed as the first thing she saw was a pile of corpses beside the fortress wall. The mountain of bodies helped her gauge the brutality of this war. And there were more such mountains scattered across the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the ground was completely charred black from the inestimable number of Thunders that must have been detonated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wind brought along a heat mixed with the smell of blood. All of these traces gave her a good idea of how fiercely the Parasites attacked and how desperately the Federation defended the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Cough.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa coughed lightly. Suddenly, she noticed a change in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murmurs of the soldiers buzzed out as they looked up at the sky. Turning her gaze upward, she saw underneath the dark clouds covering the sun, a giant holographic figure floating across the dark sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa's eyes narrowed behind her helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parasite Queen…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flickering hologram showed a giant figure sitting in a chair, resting her chin in her hands. Evidently indifferent to the arrival of the reinforcements, the Queen kept her eyes fixed on Tigol Fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the scenery below, Teresa could understand the Parasite Queen's confidence, which might have been interpreted as arrogance under different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oho, she's really going all out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Teresa heard a languid voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From out of nowhere came Cinzia. She was looking up at the sky, admiring the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appeared she had used the Teleport spell to appear next to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that's the Parasite Queen…. This is my first time seeing her in person. For her to show her true self even as a hologram… she must be dead serious about this war."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa couldn't agree more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of her army proved just how determined the Parasite Queen was. An army of corpses, parasites, Nests, and five armies led by Army Commanders… the grayish-black things swarmed all over the earth as if pandemonium had befallen the Middle World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were so many of them that it was no exaggeration to say that they could swallow the majestic Tigol Fortress without much difficulty. What was important was that Teresa would have to go in there soon, knowing that all her efforts could be in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fear of death caused the Horuses to growl softly. Teresa bit her lips, stroking the neck of the frightened Horus. It would be a lie to say that she wasn't afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it wasn't just her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear was pervasive in the faces of every soldier facing the Parasite Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'There's no way we'll win….'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly dizzy, Teresa lowered her head. Intense nausea caused by overwhelming pressure almost frightened her into falling off her horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling a sudden heat on her chest, Teresa hurriedly put her hand inside her cloak. She then took out a piece of paper and frowned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observatio Vitae. This piece of paper was a god's contract that represented the life of its contractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Again…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract was burning. More than half had already been burned, and what remained was quickly disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could only mean one thing— Seol Jihu's life was in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa murmured blankly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if to respond to her desperate cry, the fire finally stopped. All that was left now was a small piece that could barely be grabbed between two fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, this wasn't the first time this happened. She had already experienced many moments like this while advancing. The latest incident was a close call, but the contract was still alive. Although what just happened was the most serious of all those instances, the contract did not disappear in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was resisting even as a tiny piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tenacity of the contractor shook Teresa. Seeing the desperately struggling contract, Teresa collected her thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now was not the time to let fear consume her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu must be out there, fighting, even as she hesitated. He must be risking his life, crossing the boundary between life and death again and again, and having a bloody battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All for a single purpose, believing in the people left behind in the Middle World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa's heart sank when she saw the piece of paper flickering like a candle that was about to go out. In the end, she closed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Well, it's only natural."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinzia threw a glance at Teresa, who had her head down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time that humanity has witnessed the Parasite Army of this size. Even I'm a little afraid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was her way of consoling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Teresa remained silent. She opened her mouth wide and exhaled deeply, then held out the paper in her hand to Cinzia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinzia grabbed the paper nonchalantly. Suddenly, a light flickered in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Observatio Vitae, a contract that allows one to observe life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The contractor is…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The representative of Valhalla."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinzia raised her head and lightly waved the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So? Why are you giving me this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa sighed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just wanted you to know…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued with her head still down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is the only hope we have left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinzia raised one eyebrow. She said nothing and turned around with the paper still held in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll join in as soon as the contract is implemented…. I wish you luck."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A magic circle surrounded Cinzia, and she disappeared in the next instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa slowly raised her head. She opened her eyes and stared into the distance. The Parasites were on the move. There was no time to waste.&lt;br/&gt;Teresa pointed her sword at the sky, relying on the heat of the contract remaining in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ooooooh! Ooooooh!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soldiers erupted into fierce battle cries. Trying to suppress their fears, they slammed the flat ends of their weapons on to the ground, yelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa recalled her last meeting with Seol Jihu, her back against the wave of the soldiers' roars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had promised to return safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had also promised to buy him time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa clenched her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view in front of her remained the same. She still felt fear in her heart. The fact that her hand holding the sword was shaking proved this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Can I do it…?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubt crossed her mind again, but she suppressed it. She didn't have a choice. This was something she had to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu would surely keep his promise. Therefore, she had to keep her side of the bargain. And now was the time to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PPOOOOOO—!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then that the trumpet blared. Teresa's eyes brimmed with determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Right, it would be okay even if she was reduced to a meat shield. It would be okay even if she died in vain without being able to swing her sword a single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as she could do one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one thing that Seol Jihu dearly wished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To buy the time that she promised Seol Jihu…!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PPOOOOOO—!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her silver longsword, reflecting the light of the sun, slid down and pointed straight at the Parasites. At the same time, she dug her spurs into the Horus and opened her mouth wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ATTENTION…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teresa yelled as she rode her Horus down the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ADVAAAAANCE!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"""WAAAAAAAAAAH!"""&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless voices united into a single large roar that chased after her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, humanity's cavalry began to rush towards the Parasite army!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seol Jihu couldn't understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did Raging Temperance stop attacking? And why was his pendant glowing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was clear, however, was that a change had occurred inside Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was undeniable. As the light flowing outside settled down, the darkness filling up the inside became more and more confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu could tell how confused Raging Temperance was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[That's right. Temperance…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, a mass of black smoke came flying at Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Flone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Right. Temperance… It was Temperance!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Flone?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu murmured, staring vacantly at Flone, who was shifting her gaze between the giant and the pendant. However, Flone wasn't listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[O Venerable Temperance!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She put her hands together in prayer and looked up at the giant with desperate eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Please answer me if you can hear my voice!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuu…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Although the Rothschears did not serve you, you must remember that Rhetinhen transferred the Promise of Temperance to us!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'The Promise of Temperance?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu frowned, trying to remember where he'd heard that phrase before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A long time has passed, but the Promise still stands! And not long ago, the owner of the Promise handed over his rights to another man!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone pointed at Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This is that man!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuuuu…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[My grandfather acknowledged this man as the rightful owner of the Promise! He is the man to whom you must keep your promise!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone continued passionately. Although Seol Jihu didn't know what she was talking about, its effect was clear to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time she mentioned the promise, the light became brighter. Seol Jihu's pendant also began giving off a strong glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all. The giant had also withdrawn his arms before he noticed. Slowly, it raised both hands and wrapped them around its temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeuuuak! Keeuuaaaaak!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, he began screaming, wriggling his body side to side. He was clearly in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, Seol Jihu suddenly remembered the time he visited the ancient emperor's villa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, he met Flone's grandfather, and….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Favor…. Necklace…. Oath…. Change….]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Promise with the Seven Virtue's Temperance… in other words… on par with the Imperial Oath….]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Could it be…?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu shifted his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Flone, what do you mean by Promise?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[It refers to the covenant that each family of the Empire made with a god. Remember, Rothschear served Castitas, the goddess of chastity?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone explained quickly, and Seol Jihu nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So this Promise is a kind of wish?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[It's not a mere wish.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[It's a blessing and an oath that a family receives in exchange for devoting their lives to serve a god. As long as they remain loyal, not even a god can break this Promise!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone looked up at Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Hurry! My yelling will have no effect on him! Right now, you're the rightful owner of the Promise…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Seol Jihu instinctively knew what he had to do. He still had a few questions left, but those were for later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'A promise that even a god cannot break…!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu clutched his pendant. Looking up at the howling Raging Temperance, he strongly wished in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…What is he doing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness furrowed her brows. She had set the stage for Raging Temperance in respect for his unsealing of divinity that disregarded its side-effect. However, rather than finishing off the expedition team, it was rampaging by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness clicked her tongue and made adjustments to her plan. Although she did not want to get close to an unhinged divine being, something seemed to be going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She drew closer and shouted, but Raging Temperance was unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I asked what you are doing! Hurry up and…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Twisted Kindness noticed a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance was in a strange state. As the outside light was restrained, the darkness stopped seething up and quickly subsided. It was as if the energy was being controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance was controlling his divinity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurriedly looking back at the expedition team, Twisted Kindness' gaze fixed down on Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His glowing pendant immediately caught her attention. It was only a simple necklace when he was fighting her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Wait.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't an ordinary pendant. Now, she could feel a powerful link between the pendant and Raging Temperance. An irresistible law of causality that even a god could not defy was restraining the giant's mighty body!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Don't tell me!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembering the reason that the Parasite Queen could not leave the Corrupted Throne, Twisted Kindness gave a low groan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't the only problem. The current Raging Temperance had lost his reason, only having his instincts remaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what if the enemy could forcefully control this instinct too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Now isn't the time to be making petty schemes!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite not knowing what was really going on, Twisted Kindness made a cool-headed judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pendant had to be destroyed. If she didn't, she had a strong feeling that something unimaginable would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, just as she was about to make a move, she flinched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance stopped its growling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning its head, it looked straight at Twisted Kindness, who was floating in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time that Twisted Kindness felt a subtle killing intent from its fixed gaze—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance's mouth gaped open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its widened mouth, a blinding light erupted out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' eyes shot open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected attack shot forward without a single warning!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kwaaaaaaaaa!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a split second, a beam of light tearing through the air swept past Twisted Kindness!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-333"&gt;

Promise (3)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-333</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Kazuki continued speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's either that… or he already has them out. Almost like they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be. Isn't it a bit too strange to chalk it up to a simple force of habit?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller's eyes narrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that he thought about it, Raging Temperance really did release a portion of his divinity through Nightshades every time he made a move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think about it. Not just what that Unicorn said, but also what Twisted Kindness said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at that moment that Raging Temperance released its energy once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm Kazuki's theory, Philip Muller quickly unraveled his spells. As he erased the Unicorn's energy yet again—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Y-You bastards!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's furious voice echoed out. On the other hand, it could not hide its frustration and looked overtly restless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stalling for time when a new World Tree was in the process of being born was not such a wise idea. The Unicorn's reaction to getting its Nightshades killed clearly supported Kazuki's theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Now that you mention it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller pushed his glasses up. Mulling over Twisted Kindness' words just like Kazuki said, there were a few points that caught his attention as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trying to imitate Twisted Kindness and ending up with an ill side-effect…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That most likely means that Raging Temperance ran into a problem while trying to fully absorb his divinity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki finished Philip Muller's thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My guess is that he failed to fully absorb the divinity, but was also unable to get rid of his greed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since he would lose the chance to retrieve the divinity if he formed an army with the remnant energy, he must be stopping at using what he can without going over the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Puha!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller burst into laughter. He thought it was only an absurd theory at first, but now, looking back, it all made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why the Nightshades were so weak, and how Raging Temperance initially showed an instantaneous explosive power that could even send Baek Haeju flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get it now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller snickered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Kazuki was saying was simple. The Fourth Army Commander had failed to fully absorb his divinity. Because it was too burdensome to store all of it inside him, he had to release some of it outside before using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, they would be able to restrain Raging Temperance if they just forced the energy he emitted back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If your theory is right… I get why Twisted Kindness treated him like a total fool."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he didn't have the ability to fully accept the divinity, he should have used the remnant energy to create an army of his own like the other Commanders. But since he was refusing to do so out of personal greed, it made sense for Twisted Kindness to look down on him from an ally's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Self-righteous and egotistical. From the Parasites' perspective, those words fit Raging Temperance perfectly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Parasite Queen just let him be?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, Twisted Kindness did say that the Queen thinks highly of his experimental mind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki smirked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Raging Temperance's eyes flared up in anger as he looked at the chattering humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you waiting for!? Hurry up!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness urged him at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"W-Wait! I'll need to take care of these punks first…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rough snort came out of the Unicorn's nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keu! Fine, I'll kill you two first!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's horn that was aimed at the expedition team turned towards the two men. But just as it was about to kick off the ground, it was forced to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was because Philip Muller quickly raised a magic circle into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the Teleport spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeeeuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wanted to rip them apart, but it was still affected by the curse left behind by Avaritia. Unless this curse disappeared, it was impossible to chase after a spatial movement magic spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, glaring at the two men fiercely, the Unicorn fixed its stance. Then—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How's this!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A never-before-seen quantity of Nightshades shot out of its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless amounts of haze flew out in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki and Philip Muller hurriedly attacked them, but the sheer amount of Nightshades made it impossible to eliminate them in one go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Haha! Let's see if you can sto…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cackling Unicorn suddenly stopped laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A black smoke brushed past its eyes out of the blue. Each time the wildly flying smoke brushed past the haze, the Nightshades were sucked back into the Unicorn's body in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was right. The quick-witted Flone had acted swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eeek…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to do this or that, the Unicorn could only grit its teeth in frustration. It was at that moment that it felt a piercing gaze. Stealthily looking back, it saw Twisted Kindness glaring at it with furious eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are… truly…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging by her trembling voice, she seemed to have realized that the Unicorn's weakness was found out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A damned useless clown."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spitting out a biting remark, Twisted Kindness clashed forward again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn turned its gaze with a dazed face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki and Philip Muller were still on standby, and the black smoke was also swirling around the air in his vicinity. Their intent was clear. They would return the Nightshades back to its body the moment it released them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's face reddened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Twisted Kindness said was one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what was even worse was that two trifling humans were shackling its freedom. This hurt its pride more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could it not feel humiliated with its embarrassing weakness revealed to the whole world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yoooooou…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, what infuriated it the most was that it could not do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You puny insects….!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's face went red with rage…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You puny insects dareeeee!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before its eyes suddenly flashed with darkness mixed with light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that it's come to this, screw it all!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki knit his eyebrows at the unexpected roar. And witnessing what happened in the next moment, his mouth gaped open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will kill you allllll!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with a scream shaking the heaven and earth, the Unicorn's body was torn into shreds like a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the shattering pieces of its body, a dark figure popped out. At the same time, a large gale raged around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon could only mean one thing. Raging Temperance had unsealed his divinity!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki and Philip Muller were forced to look up as the darkness that emerged from the Unicorn's body began to expand in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two meters, four meters, eight meters, sixteen meters…!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing at an exponential rate, the head of the figure reached the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final form that appeared shortly afterward was truly the definition of bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shadowy giant, whose body was made of burning darkness!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just darkness. An orderly white light was flowing around the giant overlooking the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even that only lasted a moment. As if it was affected by the burning darkness, the light slowly began to boil before bubbling like lava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huaaaaaaaa!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deafening howl burst out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki's cheeks turned pale. He didn't expect Raging Temperance to go so far as to unseal his divinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, they would arrive at the best outcome if they could hold out for the duration until his divinity ran out… but facing this towering figure directly, Kazuki realized that this was only an empty dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans were fundamentally different from gods. A mortal was incapable of defeating an immortal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the battle came to a total lull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kuaaaak! Kuaaaaak!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The darkness once again let out a deafening howl, and then it slammed down its titanic foot as if to vent anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOOM!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ground jumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not an exaggeration. As the foot slammed down, the earth was flipped upside down, causing a huge earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rumble!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition team members lost their balance at the terrifying rumbling of the earth and fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensity even made Twisted Kindness falter. Immediately spreading her wings and flying up, Twisted Kindness' eyes lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hoh!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazing at the towering giant overlooking the earth, she exclaimed in a great surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a little late, but you're finally being useful!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing a sigh of relief, Twisted Kindness regained her composure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Unicorn, Raging Temperance was a buffoon who could not even wield his sealed divinity. However, a god was still a god. As long as he fully unsealed his divinity, even she could not look down on him. Though it would only last a few minutes, he would display absolute power!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, Twisted Kindness flew far into the distance. Her efficiency-focused personality made her want to fight together with him, but she knew she could not do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Army Commander's Divinity Manifestation had a problem that was on a fundamentally different level than the other Army Commanders' Divinity Manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other Army Commanders simply took a long time to recuperate after unsealing their divinities. However, the Fourth Army Commander had a side-effect of losing his reason due to not having absorbed his divinity in a normal way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, he went mad and indiscriminately attacked both allies and foes. This was the main reason for his 'Raging' title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that wasn't the only side-effect. Once Raging Temperance unsealed his divinity, he could not control his energy without the help of another Army Commander. So if left alone, he would rampage until he ran out of time and then perish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Twisted Kindness did not have any intention of helping Raging Temperance control his energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is perfect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smile emerged on her face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn't need to look to know that the pesky expedition team would get swept away by the overwhelming difference in their league. Even if a few managed to escape, she could easily give chase and finish them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the embarrassment of an Army Commander would also self-destruct at the end of it all, how could she not be happy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fufu, I will at least cheer you on in your final moments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness raised her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rumble!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ground heaved once again. A thick wall rose from the earth and surrounded the expedition team in an instant. It was as if they were trapped in a circular stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Krr?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low growl rang out inside. The dark giant slowly scanned its surroundings at the sudden appearance of the wall. It was like a predator searching for its first prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju murmured all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need to ru…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she shut her mouth half-way. Breaking the wall and escaping did not guarantee safety. For some reason, Twisted Kindness had disappeared. Although Baek Haeju did not know where she went, looking at the wall, she was sure Twisted Kindness was looking at them. In that case, splitting up and running away would only make it so that she could cut them down one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition team was truly stuck between a rock and a hard place, and they stood still in a daze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People instinctively feared the unknown. Moreover, the dark giant was giving off a terrifying pressure that threatened to crush them just by standing near it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu barely managed to twist his trembling neck and turned his gaze. All sorts of thoughts flashed through his mind, but he wasn't in any situation to be nitpicking every available option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; in front of him was a truly unfathomable existence! Looking at it, he partly understood why the Army Commanders treated humans as 'insects'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju was right. They could not fight it. They had to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, as he opened his mouth to shout—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The giant's head suddenly turned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu froze up mid-sentence. It couldn't be helped. The giant had looked down at him with a monstrous, irresistible gaze. Just by looking at it, his body stiffened like a frog in front of a snake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death. Unavoidable death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, that was the only thing that popped up in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whoosh.&lt;/em&gt; Raging Temperance walked forward. With a single step, it arrived in front of Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It pulled its right arm back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kuaaaaaaaak!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a deafening roar, it swung down at full power. Its shaking arm descended vertically like a falling roller coaster!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Seol Jihu went 'Ah', a powerful gale whipped up around him. As his bangs fluttered from the wind, Seol Jihu's eyes waned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He couldn't dodge it. Even if he did, it would be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack carrying the full power of Raging Temperance was more than enough to obliterate the entire land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of instinct, Seol Jihu aimed his spear at the sky. Although he roused his mana, he still had the same devastated face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I held out… this far…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was already gasping for breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I got… this far….'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His widened eyes lost strength and slowly began to close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I can't… die…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, darkness blanketed his vision. Feeling closer to death than ever before, Seol Jihu shut his eyes and wished from his deepest subconsciousness!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I don't want to die…!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whoosh—!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an instant, Seol Jihu felt all sorts of indescribable feelings. If he had to liken them to something, it would be the feeling of bungee jumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A terrifying blade of wind swept past his entire body, and his lower stomach churned as if it would explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the fierce wind flew far away and disappeared, this sensation had vanished completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fluttering hair and flapping coat slowly subsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a moment, all sorts of thoughts swirled inside his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Did I die…?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did he die without feeling even a slight pain because the attack was just that powerful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Am I… alive?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's closed eyes slowly opened. Next, his blinking pupils were dyed in bewilderment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He still only saw darkness. But when he staggered back unwittingly, he realized the darkness was the giant's hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its fist was right in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could only mean that for some reason, the fist had stopped before it hit him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazing at the fist with a blank look, Seol Jihu soon realized a small change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outside light that was raging from the rampaging darkness inside the Fourth Army Commander slowly calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receding at a rapid rate visible to the naked eye, it eventually restrained itself like serene river water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was as if it was reacting to something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just what happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who was about to look up, flinched. He had just then seen a silvery light being emitted below his chin, illuminating the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking around to find where this light was coming from, Seol Jihu subconsciously lowered his head. Soon, when he found the source of the light, his mouth slowly gaped open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Seol Jihu's neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…My pendant…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pendant hanging from his neck was shining with a pure, silvery light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-332"&gt;

Promise (2)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-332</link><description>&lt;p&gt;"Great!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick jumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flapping its little wings, it chirped joyfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea failed to understand the situation for a short while, but it didn't take long for him to realize the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tentacles crisscrossing in the air stopped altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guoooooo—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They exploded like fireworks when the Yggdrasil Roar burst out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having thought that he had failed, an exclamation of joy escaped Marcel Ghionea's mouth. However, it was too soon to be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woo—! Wooooo—!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nests that had their tentacles annihilated screamed. At the same time, they began to wriggle crazily. Like a balloon being pumped with air, they repeatedly expanded out and shriveled back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, at the moment their surfaces became tense and bloated—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ssssshk!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea clearly caught sight of a grey, discolored arm coming out of one Nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The branches that shot up to the sky shook as if to break at any moment. As they shook more fiercely, the number of fireflies coming out increased. And so, as the fluttering sparks of light touched the grey figure, it began to regain its original color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, when the black aura of death completely dissipated, a bright red color surfaced on the figure, and a fiery blaze suddenly ignited on the Nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crackle!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After instantly being enveloped in flames, the Nest's cries became even more sorrowful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this wasn't the only Nest that was showing a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Nest suddenly shrunk as if it was being compressed by air, and another Nest was being torn to shreds by blades of wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end result for all the Nests was death by violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the husk of the dead tree cracked and scattered away, the five Nests couldn't stand the pressure and exploded. At the same time, figures emanating a large presence rose up from each Nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just by standing up, they dyed the surrounding air in their colors— clay-brown, water-blue, dark-red, jade-green, and sky-blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surviving Spirits erupted into a cheer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Whooooo!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The Spirit Kings!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea finally recovered his senses and looked around the surroundings. He couldn't find Little Chick. It wasn't until he turned back to the front that he saw Little Chick flying forward a little ways ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splash.&lt;/em&gt; Marcel Ghionea caught up to it and threw himself into the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing the paddling Little Chick forward, he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happened? Why did the World Tree suddenly disappear?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick quickly replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was granted a new life. Since it took care of the urgent matter at hand, it's trying to throw away its dead body and be reborn in a clean, new body. That will be much better for it in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But just now—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fool. Do you think the World Tree is an idiot? If it became a seed leaf right away, the Nests would have devoured it immediately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick continued curtly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told you. We had a chance because the World Tree remained even with a contaminated body. When we delivered the new seed to it, it regained control of its body and used the power of the sedges to blow up the Nests. Having five sedges was really a divine fortune."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, so annoying! Just see for yourself!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea stared ahead at Little Chick's scolding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wastewater-filled lake had been purified before he noticed. Water that was as clear and transparent as a mirror flowed in the lake, shining brightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the water was deep, he could see to the depths like the palm of his hand using the Thousand-Mile Eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was just as Little Chick said. The seed had put down its roots where the World Tree stood. Now, it had already sprouted. Despite being tiny, the seed leaf opened, and it quickly grew in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Marcel Ghionea reached the center of the lake, it was already on the brink of becoming a sapling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Tree's seed would need thousands of years to grow to adulthood without the help of the sedges or the nutrients left behind by the previous World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So taking this into account, the new World Tree was growing at an astonishing speed. The five Aphrisos' Sedges were displaying their prowess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a while. Have you all been well?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick spoke up as soon as it reached the center of the lake. The Spirit Kings that were blankly floating in the air looked down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You're…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fiery titan, whose body was made of flames, slowly lowered his head. After gazing at Little Chick intently, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I see… I was wondering what happened… So it was you, Arcus Spirit…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[L-Lord Rainbow Spirit!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A water-colored Spirit resembling a mermaid acted familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You've come to save us—!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shut up!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Little Chick flew into a rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goddamn idiots, total buffoons! Is it that hard to forgive the Cave Fairies? You insisted on being obstinate even in such a situation?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[That's…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's? That's what? Do you see what happened to this world because of your worthless stubbornness? Why don't you take a good look around!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirit Kings fell silent at Little Chick's reproach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Hey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea nudged Little Chick. Although he didn't know what it was talking about, he knew now wasn't the time to be arguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick clicked its tongue before clearing its throat. Then, it cut straight to the chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should know that this situation isn't over, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, the five Spirit Kings all turned to one direction. It was the same direction where Marcel Ghionea had come from. They must have felt Twisted Kindness' boundless power as they shivered slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever. Hand over your powers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…Our powers? Ah, you mean—]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should know since you faced those monsters. I don't know how long they'll last. I won't repeat myself again. Hand them over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[We want to, but…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fire Spirit King, Ifrit, trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Unfortunately, it isn't possible at the moment.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? Why?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[As you probably know, we were stuck inside the Nests for a long time, providing them with nutrients. Although we recovered a little thanks to the World Tree supplying us with power at the last moment, we still only have a fraction of our full strength. As it stands, it won't matter even if we give you our powers.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't you retrieve them?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick asked as it pointed at the remnants of the Nests floating on the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[No. Those energies have been contaminated beyond recovery.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ifrit shook its large head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The World Tree didn't purify them.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then just purify them now!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This is the will and the judgment of the World Tree. Although we could if we really wanted to, that would put too much pressure on the World Tree that just evolved into a young tree.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick grunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inside of the World Tree had been empty when the five Nests were eating away at it. Since it couldn't purify the contaminated energy, it would have had to fill the gap using more of the energy from the seed and the sedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the World Tree did not do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it blew up the Nests, it immediately stopped and entered the cycle of rebirth. It must have judged that using any more of the energy would not allow its new body to reach adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the situation at Tigol Fortress, this decision wasn't so hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Wait just a moment. I don't know how you managed to obtain so many sedges, but there isn't one, but five of them. One hour— no, thirty minutes should be enough. With the World Tree growing, we will also recover our powers and give you the amount you want.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ifrit was not wrong. But the important thing was that Seol Jihu's group might not last another thirty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every second of every minute was pivotal in this situation. Waiting thirty minutes was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it! If only I had more power!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick bellowed in rage before flying out. It swam to the remnants of the Nests, then looked around quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, it discovered the black nucleus of the Nest and dug its head toward it. And what ensued made Marcel Ghionea drop his jaw in shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peck, peck, peck!&lt;/em&gt; Little Chick began to peck at the nucleus at a frightening speed. Unless he was seeing things, Little Chick was eating the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Ah, right, he could do that as well.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Marcel Ghionea was about to shout if it had gone mad, a voice flowing with the wind halted his thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, a sharp wind blew. The remaining four nuclei floated up from the remnants of the Nests. After the wind cut them into small, bite-sized pieces, they were gently delivered to Little Chick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Spirit resembling a translucent, green Fairy slowly lowered her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the Wind Spirit King, Sylphid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She looked at the dazedly blinking Marcel Ghionea and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I know what you are worried about, but there's no need to be alarmed.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's fine to eat those?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Of course! Arcus-nim is an extraordinarily special Spirit, born under the blessing of the Goddess of Chastity.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A special Spirit?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I would have to go describe what happened back then to give a proper explanation. Unfortunately, we don't have the time.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Simply put, Arcus-nim was born with the duty to annihilate evil.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[He was born solely for that purpose, and all of his Authorities and abilities are designed to facilitate that purpose.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[That is to say, devouring objects tainted by evil is also a part of his duty. To Arcus-nim, evil is only prey for him to feed on. He can use any source of evil as nutrients for growth.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea swallowed hard. He thought Little Chick was simply an ill-tempered Spirit Beast, but it turned out to be much more incredible. He could tell just by the way the Spirit Kings treated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, he didn't care much about such things. Marcel Ghionea stared at Little Chick impatiently. The only reason he did not urge it was because he could tell Little Chick was rushing to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Hurry, hurry…!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much time went by?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Burrrp—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick let out a loud burp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea opened his mouth at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you finished?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mm, this is acceptable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick nodded. Perhaps because of its bloated stomach, it looked bigger than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all. Its golden-yellow hair had turned half-transparent, almost like the Spirits floating around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait, you…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's there to be surprised about? I'm a Spirit too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I won't last long in this form, but it should be enough. Anyway, let's hurry on out of here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Damn it, just what's going on?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll explain later. I rushed to eat, so there's still a lot I haven't fully digested. I need to concentrate on digesting it, so don't talk to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, Little Chick closed its eyes. Marcel Ghionea shook his head, then picked Little Chick up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Let me give you a hand.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sylphid waved her hand, the Archer of Steel floated up and left the lake in an instant. At the same time, a gust of wind enveloped his body, and he felt himself become lighter. Though he couldn't be sure, it was likely an ability that increased his speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Please, do your best to hold on. We will join you as soon as we recover our energy.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ifrit's voice flew in from behind his back, but Marcel Ghionea did not answer. The moment he stepped onto the land, he had started running at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Marcel Ghionea left the premise of the lake and turned into a small dot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Oi, Magician."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Kazuki's call, a young man being treated by Maria's healing spell turned his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…It's Philip Muller."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever. Can you lend me a hand?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller narrowed his eyes at the sudden request. In truth, it was very easy to see that he was in a sorry state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one simple reason. It was because he used Manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for an Executor, summoning a god to their body was too taxing. Paying a huge price was only natural. This was the reason Philip Muller did not play an active role since the arrival of Twisted Kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's about that Unicorn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki lowered his voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has a weakness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weakness?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes. We might be able to hold it down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller's eyes lit up. Preventing Raging Temperance from helping Twisted Kindness. If this was truly possible, they would be able to slow down the increasing pressure on the expedition team's throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's simple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki aimed his bow at the hazy creatures and continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just have to get rid of those Nightshades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller furrowed his brows. Just as he was about to ask what this was about—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prrrrr!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn dropped its head toward Chohong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki urgently shouted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hurry!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller clenched his teeth and chanted a spell. Although he was still full of questions, this was a situation where actions were needed more than words. Moreover, he wasn't so stupid to be asking for an explanation when every second was of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Kazuki fired his arrow, and a magic circle arose from the thick book Philip Muller was holding in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn halted its charge. It was because a consecutive flurry of arrows and magic spells instantly swallowed the haze around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nightshades were easy opponents from the beginning. Although Kazuki and Philip Muller were tired, they were more than capable of fighting such weak creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The haze instantly dimmed and returned to Raging Temperance's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki did not miss the Unicorn's body stiffening for a split second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tsk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn clicked its tongue and released the Nightshades again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was the same this time. As several spells and arrows flew over, the haze went back where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the rearing Unicorn stopped and stiffened once again. Its raised forelegs dropped to the ground idly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller glanced at Kazuki. Although he was preparing spells as Kazuki requested, he was asking whether this was ultimately meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacking the Nightshades was clearly distracting the Unicorn for a moment, but with the haze being absorbed into the Unicorn's body and re-released, Philip Muller couldn't help but think it was meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, Kazuki was convinced. It was because the Unicorn turned back at them with a look of disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's as I thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki nodded as he nocked another arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get why the Parasite Queen forced Raging Temperance to stay cooped up in this world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You see, I've been wondering ever since our first battle. The Nightshades, I mean. The reason they're sucked into Raging Temperance without dying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, that alone isn't too strange. After all, they're the remnants of a divinity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki spoke quickly as he watched the Unicorn intently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But that isn't the only strange thing. Have you noticed?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Noticed what?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Raging Temperance…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click.&lt;/em&gt; Kazuki finished preparing another arrow and continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He always releases Nightshades before using his divinity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-331"&gt;

Promise (1)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-331</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ping!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrow left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the loading to the firing, only a short moment went by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrow, which Marcel Ghionea poured out his heart and soul into firing, cut through the air with a firm, steel-like will to reach its destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It went without saying that an arrow could not change its course once it was released and in the air. It would be a different story for someone like the Star of Pride, whose arrows were tied with a chain or Ayase Kazuki, who had the 'Swallow Arrow' skill that let him redirect his air-borne arrows. But at the very least, the Archer that just shot this arrow did not have such an ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Marcel Ghionea believed in himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His 'Archer of Steel' title was not just for a show. Ever since he entered Paradise, save for unavoidable circumstances like expeditions, he shot thousands of arrows every day to train his abilities. He did not skip even a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, he felt it when the arrow left the string. A near-absolute confidence, even when considering the irregular movements of the Nests and the Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All he had to do now was wait for the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, the arrow finally entered the Nests' range of attack. To a bystander unfamiliar with the circumstances, this might have happened in an instant. But for Marcel Ghionea, who was still maintaining his hyper-focus, everything was in slow-motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp arrowhead tearing through the air and the seed and the sedges tightly tied to the arrow shaft were all clearly visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of tentacles flurrying every which way brushed past the arrow shaft by a narrow margin on multiple occasions. The spider web-like net, created by the tentacles as they moved to kill the desperately attacking Spirits, obstructed the arrow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even the most closely-stitched spiderweb has a gap. The arrow, flying in an arc, shockingly flew into this tiny hole and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the tentacles loosened up and separated, Marcel Ghionea clearly caught sight of an arrow brushing past a young Spirit and continuing onward without reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, the steel arrow was still marching forward, unhindered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea's tightly-shut left eye opened. His widened eyes then stared fixedly at the arrow. At this moment, his sense of time was at a complete stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He felt like his heart would explode from the tense nervousness, and his stomach roiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing was perfect. No, it wasn't just the timing. The speed, the direction, and every element affecting the arrow were all shouting that it would hit its mark just a second later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the arrow had overcome the mountain of tentacles, which was expected to be the biggest impasse, the chance of success had gone up significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because at this point, the Nests would not be able to deal with the arrow even if they noticed it. By the time they moved their tentacles to stop it, the arrow would have already hit its mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, that had to be the case given the speed of the arrow and its distance to the target and the tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…And indeed, Marcel Ghionea's calculations weren't wrong. Except, that was only if he accounted for the tentacles that were already out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another second went by. As Marcel Ghionea clenched his sweaty hands, he witnessed an unexpected change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The husk of the dead tree cracked up, and a branch-like tentacle came flying out through the bulging shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, it shot toward the arrow right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tak!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a split second, the arrowhead shook like a fishtail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not forward, but downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea's pupils shook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nest had used the dead World Tree to ward off the arrow! Who would have guessed that a tentacle would shoot out of the dead tree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it was a well-known fact that the World Tree had been contaminated. This was a miscalculation on Marcel Ghionea's part. The urgency of the situation had made him focus only on the Nests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deflected arrow helplessly rose to the sky. As Marcel Ghionea stared at the lifeless arrow, his eyes died together with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treasures that Seol Jihu went through all kinds of hardships to get were on the brink of returning to nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'If Mister Kazuki was here and not me…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he could, he would not hesitate to grab the arrow and hurl it down. Unfortunately, he was only given a single chance, and there was no way to alter the target of an already-fired arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of being unable to overcome this final hurdle was… failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this word popped up inside his head, Marcel Ghionea's expression paled with shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same for the Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lowest-ranked Spirit that was blindly charging forward was coincidentally near the trajectory of the arrow. Although it had tilted its head at first, when it saw the seed and the sedges tied to the arrow, it immediately did a double-take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[That's…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Spirit born and raised in the Spirit Realm, there was simply no way it would not recognize these items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the face of the lowest-ranked Spirit immediately stained with regret. It realized what Little Chick was aiming for the instant it saw the arrow, but the arrow was currently swimming in the air helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Ah! Aaaaah!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It stretched out its arm with a yearning heart, but its efforts were in vain. It wanted to fly and grab the arrow, but a sudden gale blew against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't have to see to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tentacle was flying toward it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Aaaah…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a low groan, the expression of the lowest-ranked Spirit paled. Marcel Ghionea clenched his fists and dropped his head, and Little Chick also shut both its eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then. Just as the tentacle was about to strike the young Spirit—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Iyaaaaa!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-ranked Spirit suddenly flew in between them. It immediately grabbed the lowest-ranked Spirit's shoulders and turned back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clap!&lt;/em&gt; The tentacle whipped the low-ranked Spirit's back, which promptly bent in a frightening way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Uuuuuugh!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low-ranked Spirit clenched its teeth. Then, using the propulsive force of the blow, it pushed the lowest-ranked Spirit far away!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Please…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voice of the low-ranked Spirit quickly grew faint. The lowest-ranked Spirit stood in a daze as its body was pushed up. But its confusion only lasted a moment. As soon as something touched its fingertip—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest-ranked Spirit immediately realized what it had to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A soccer game didn't end the first time a shooter failed to score. If the ball did not leave the field, the shooter's teammates would still have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirit clenched the object that fell in its hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had no time to rest or to even turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Tree was humungous. The arrow would surely reach it as long as it was traveling in its general direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Goooooo!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the lowest-ranked Spirit shut its eyes, accelerating in the direction it was already going in. Meanwhile, it gave its all in stretching out the arm holding the arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like seizing a ball rebounding off the goal post and striking it down, the Spirit pushed the arrow to its intended destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that instant, the tentacle was a little slow to react. Perhaps the Nest had not expected this development, or perhaps everything had simply happened too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pak!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What mattered was that the arrow, pushed forward with the power of the Spirit's life, reached the husk of the World Tree at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half a second later, at the same time that the pursuing tentacle whipped the young Spirit's back, its baby-like hands pushed the arrow inside. The erupting stem of the dead tree was pushed back inside, and the arrow finally dug into the husk!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole thing happened in less than a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Heeeeeu!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest-ranked Spirit writhed in pain after being flung to the ground. It narrowly opened its eyes as it felt the last of its energy leave its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moments later, as the young Spirit scattered into particles of water droplets, a faint smile emerged on its face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it saw. It saw the arrow buried inside the upper area of the World Tree, only leaving the fletching visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn't just some optical illusion. The entirety of the dead tree beginning to quiver like a leaf proved that it had succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, the dead tree was reacting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Wo…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Spirit, it knew better than anyone else. The aura of death filling up the dead tree combusted into oblivion at a terrifying rate. And a fresh, pure aura, newly coming into being, filled the disappearing aura's spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enormous aura unwittingly burst out from the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing this pressure, the hundreds of tentacles instantly stopped moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sssss, sssss….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small sparks of light glowing like fireflies flowed out of the World Tree and danced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Tree was showing signs of reviving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[World Tree-nim…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young Spirit muttered in a crying voice. Although its voice soon turned into an empty ringing, it was not meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The branches that had been drooping down responded to the cry of a young Spirit and began to slowly rise to the sky, extending out infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guooooooooo—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, an inestimable pulsation echoed out, almost to the point of reaching outer space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the so-called Yggdrasil Roar, the sign of the birth of a new World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successfully reviving after a desperately dangerous situation, the World Tree bloomed at last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kwang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu was slammed down on the ground with a boom. Immediately afterward, a longsword soaked in blood struck down with a force capable of splitting the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a gasp, Seol Jihu somersaulted up. As he got out of the way by a narrow margin, a chilling sound cutting through the air tickled his back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"——!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' roar burst out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rumble!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earth seemed to roll as long, oddly-shaped rocks shot up to the sky. Earth dragons made of rocks ascended into being and shot toward the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their speed was enough to instill terror in even the most courageous heroes, but Seol Jihu's mind was as placid as a tranquil lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staring at the dragon-shaped amalgamation of rocks, Seol Jihu pumped up his mana and swung the Spear of Purity in a wide arc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of golden sword qi immediately shot out, destroying the earth dragon charging toward him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu inwardly marveled at the power-up that surpassed his wildest imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This much…!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remembered what Jang Maldong said. That once he became a 'true' High Ranker, it would not be an exaggeration to be called the strongest Earthling under Level 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was not lying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since he awakened the realm of One With the Spear, he had been living in a new world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's biggest weakness had been the disharmony of his mind, technique, and body. But thanks to One With the Spear, his technique had caught up to his body completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Phi Sora was similarly the master of One With the Sword, but she had different hardware than Seol Jihu. With different hardware, a different output was only natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only, Seol Jihu was displaying such a significant difference just by balancing two elements of the mind, technique, and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same now. From the remnants of the shattered earth dragon, Twisted Kindness emerged like a ray of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're finally mine!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clang!&lt;/em&gt; As her longsword clashed with the Spear of Purity, Seol Jihu was quickly pushed back. At the same time, a terrifying energy flooded into him through the Spear of Purity. The foreign energy was very clearly intending to invade his body and blow it up from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Seol Jihu did not panic. After becoming one with his weapon, things he couldn't even dream of in the past naturally came to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, his body learned them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tremendous energy was difficult to resist, but he didn't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he couldn't take it, he simply had to return it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recalling the first time he created sword qi, Seol Jihu immediately came up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He guided the flowing energy into his body. Circulating it through his Circuit as if he was training his mana, he guided all of the energy to his right hand and sent it to the sword grinding against his Spear of Purity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he released it from his body—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Ability, Floral Substitution (Intermediate), has been created.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with an alert, a second longsword that was striking down at him like lightning was abruptly pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having most of the energy she released returned back to her, Twisted Kindness' eyes widened in shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What's this…?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Seol Jihu wasn't unharmed. Due to enduring such powerful energy, his Circuit was burning in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To cool off his Circuit, he leaped back and distanced himself. Of course, Twisted Kindness chased after him immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She would normally catch up to him in an instant, but the expedition team members, who managed to defeat the earth dragons, charged at her from all sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju's Tathagata Spear came piercing in like a comet, Agnes' threads imbued with holy power spread out in the surroundings, and Phi Sora's longsword flew in drawing a fiery path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Seventh Army Commander was still the Seventh Army Commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pesky punks!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she swung her twin swords in a rage, the attacks flying in from all directions were completely stopped in their tracks. And when she emitted her divinity, the Warriors were knocked down like flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With such a show of force, she was truly worthy of being called the strongest Army Commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This won't do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing her mind, Twisted Kindness turned around. She planned to deal with the others first rather than Seol Jihu, who continuously grew during the battle. Eliminating Seol Jihu, only after all the other hindrances were taken care of, seemed to be the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, she charged toward Phi Sora, who looked comparatively weaker than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at that moment, Seol Jihu's spear rushed in like a storm, crackling with electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness did not stop. She had confidence in being able to avoid it without looking back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the speartip was about to reach her head—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What!?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shocked Twisted Kindness hurriedly turned her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn't have any other choice. Because just as she was about to tilt her head in a simple manner, she felt a destructive mana fiercely cutting toward her from the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had sent the pesky Warriors flying by emitting her energy just now, so Seol Jihu should be the only one near her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling a sense of urgency, Twisted Kindness gave up on Phi Sora and turned around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a horrifying sensation narrowly brushed past her forehead, she saw a spinning Seol Jihu tightly clutching onto his spear shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spear had flown past her on the left. Twisted Kindness turned her head matching that direction. But in the next moment, her mouth gaped open at the scorching pain scratching her opposite cheek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she did not scream, she couldn't hide her shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flying back first, Twisted Kindness quickly touched her right cheek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood came off on her hand. Seol Jihu seemed to have halted the thrust of his spear, attacking with the crescent blade on the side of the spear blade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, such a minor injury quickly clotted and disappeared, but that wasn't the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting aside the fact that Seol Jihu suddenly began to utilize the crescent blade, Twisted Kindness should not have been hit by the previous attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the spear that was on her left side suddenly attacked from the right. It wasn't as if the spear moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of this was the Crescent Blade Spear Technique's Third Ultimate Art, Formless Spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Again…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' expression slowly contorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, she thought Seol Jihu gained the ability to maneuver better and move his spear on its own. But now, he was returning her energy and even displaying the realm of using an invisible spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, he was gaining more resources as the fight dragged on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the reason Twisted Kindness' calculations continued to be off. Although she could still handle him, what hidden card would he reveal next caused her to hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And soon, her worry turned into reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guoooo—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a pulsation from afar swept past her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She did not need to go look, to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was because the presence of the five Nests that the Unicorn had brought along disappeared all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Don't tell me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was, without a doubt, the sign of the World Tree's revival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she couldn't figure out what happened, her head reeled at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ash tree rivaling a god was reviving at the current moment? If that really happened, the outcome of this battle would no longer be within her control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking so, Twisted Kindness cried out angrily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Raging Temperance!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…I know. I felt it as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you know, why are you just sitting there?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The injuries I got from those insects healed to a certain extent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sarcastic reply came back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But a certain being comparable to a god hit me twice, and I haven't recovered from those injuries yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness turned away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn looked nervous as well, and it didn't seem to be lying as it was still fettered with scars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmph, don't worry. I'll get moving soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…I strongly recommend that you do. If this plan goes awry…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness growled before clashing with the enemy once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki was biting his lip, watching the battle unfold. He couldn't help but marvel at Seol Jihu, who was cooperating with Baek Haeju to fight to resist the formidable Seventh Army Commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He couldn't believe his eyes even though he was seeing it directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, they were still in a perilous situation. Besides Baek Haeju and Seol Jihu, Seo Yuhui, Agnes, Phi Sora, Hoshino Urara, and the others were tenaciously popping in and out of battle, but all they could do was hang onto their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having started to use her full strength, Twisted Kindness was still full of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they made so much as a single mistake, the situation could tip over to the enemy's side in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition team would undoubtedly fall into a greater disadvantage as time went on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance joining the battle would also turn the tide of battle. The expedition team simply could not handle both Army Commanders simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Marcel Ghionea…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had to come up with a solution to escape this inevitable fate, and Kazuki knew that was why Marcel Ghionea left the battlefield with Little Chick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'But…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if they succeeded, would the expedition team be able to last until then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it rationally, Kazuki was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he didn't know what Little Chick was aiming to do, it would most likely need a long time to achieve its goal and return. Considering the obstacles that must be blocking its path and the time needed to get through them…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'…Damn it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki couldn't help but come to the conclusion that the expedition team would be wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, Kazuki felt the need to buy time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had already given up on attacking Twisted Kindness. Though he had been shooting arrows at her continuously, she had never paid any attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki felt there was no place for him in the battle of monsters. All he could do was trust in his teammates to hold Twisted Kindness back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best he could do at the moment was to stop the Fourth Army Commander from rejoining the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'But how…?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could he do in this spot as someone who was specialized for investigating rather than fighting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good, good…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn cracked its head left and right. The way it pawed at the ground, it looked ready to start fighting again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's get going!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was just as Kazuki expected. A faint haze began to come out of the Unicorn's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Wait.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some unknown reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[It doesn't look like you have the slightest clue why the Queen threw you in here.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the nightshades hovering around the Unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[How ridiculous! You actually have the galls to say that in your sorry state? Your actions are riddled with self-righteousness and egotism, so how can you shamelessly call yourself an ally?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The Queen is keeping you by her side only because she thinks highly of your experimental mind. Otherwise, she would have replaced you long ago. Have some shame.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki remembered what Twisted Kindness mockingly said to the Unicorn…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Hmph. It doesn't matter. Even if I can't do anything about the Authority, I can just recover the divinity I've lost.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And also the Unicorn's past actions, which did not seem strange back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[If you'd acknowledged your limits and formed a proper army as the Queen suggested, I would have acknowledged you as an ally. But—]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You tried to imitate me and ended up ripping your crotch. That is why you are in such a pathetic state.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[With such an obvious weakness, don't you feel ashamed calling yourself an Army Commander?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the final piece of the puzzle fell into place, a conjecture popped up in Kazuki's head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weakness…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A possibility for delaying time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…I found it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazuki's eyes lit up as they glared at Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-330"&gt;

Awakening, the Last Stand (4)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-330</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As Seol Jihu and Baek Haeju were attacking from the front and back, an intense light burst out from Twisted Kindness' body. The light was so dazzling that it was almost blinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, Seol Jihu plummeted to the ground like a suddenly dropping elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of the intense light and the enormous surge of energy was none other than divinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of a god burned the spiderweb in an instant and even pushed Seol Jihu down easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same for Baek Haeju. Swept away by the sudden storm, she fell like a kite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu lamented as he kicked the ground. Success was at the tip of his finger, so he couldn't help but get disappointed when it disappeared like a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They should have sealed the deal while Twisted Kindness had her guard down. Unfortunately, their one and only chance came to an end in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely, their previous tactic would not work a second time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'We need to get back to Tigol Fortress as soon as possible…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this expedition did not end at just defeating the two Army Commanders. Taking into account the time it would take to rescue the Spirit Realm and resurrect the World Tree, they were already too far behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was that they couldn't even deal with the Army Commanders in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu bit his lip and looked up at the sky. The light had subsided before he noticed, and Twisted Kindness was standing tall and glaring down at him. Judging by her noticeably flushed cheeks and neck, she must be enraged without a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation had only become more difficult. Since she was almost defeated, she probably would not continue going easy on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And indeed, Twisted Kindness' heart was beating with rage. The previous action of releasing energy was done subconsciously by her survival instinct. In other words, her senses had judged that the previous attack could have been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When was the last time she felt a threat to her life since fully absorbing a divinity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She couldn't even remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' mouth turned crooked at the sensation she had not felt in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…I'll take back what I said earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She calmly spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wasn't because you got lucky or because the circumstances lined up. Bringing such circumstances about and achieving a goal should certainly be considered as part of one's ability. You are worthy of having exterminated Undying Diligence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' evaluation of him went up, but Seol Jihu did not look happy in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as he thought, Twisted Kindness' tone made it clear that she would no longer be going easy on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whew…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' heart was beating quickly, but her head was calmly analyzing the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her personal philosophy was that a battle was an exchange of resources. The outcome of a battle was decided by the amount of energy, techniques, and physical prowess one had and by how efficiently they used them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a simple reason that Twisted Kindness had acted with such leisure until now. None of her enemies were ever capable of handling her resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Baek Haeju could to a certain degree. Other than her, no one was able to lay a finger on her, so all she had to do was pour all her resources onto one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with Seol Jihu rejoining the battle, the situation had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she couldn't understand how he suddenly became so strong, what she knew for certain was that her opponents' resources had increased by a significant amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they used their resources in an effective manner like before, the same situation as before could happen again. Not to mention, there was no guarantee what the Star of Lust and Avarice would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such was the nature of a battle against many. Now having to pay attention to two people at once, Twisted Kindness felt a slight apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the solution was simple. She simply had to increase her budget and acquire more resources, just like her enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had two methods of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first was to call an ally of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Raging Temperance!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn raised its head after suddenly having its name called out. Until now, the Fourth Army Commander had been quietly spectating the battle from Twisted Kindness' threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, he wasn't just watching and was also treating his wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Join the battle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will take back what I said before. Don't just sit there and help. I need your strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance was taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I won't repeat myself again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness still had a commanding tone but asked for assistance first after having acted alone thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance was surprised seeing the firmly speaking Twisted Kindness. Then, he stared at the expedition team with a renewed gaze. He couldn't help but wonder just how amazing they must be to make this proud and egotistical dragon go back on her words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, the Fourth Army Commander got up. Though he wanted to mock Twisted Kindness, he could tell how serious she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wouldn't be asking for his help just to have an easier time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Don't tell me…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be because she saw a slight possibility, no matter how slim, of the unthinkable happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fine. From now on, I will help as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like that, the spectating Raging Temperance announced his return to battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faces of the expedition team members paled. It really felt like they were being kicked while down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that wasn't all. Twisted Kindness still had another method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get it now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stared at Seol Jihu with a deep gaze and spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand the Queen's intent. I've never seen a constellation like you. You are truly an absurd Star."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said something he couldn't quite understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Queen was right. It might have been better to just leave you be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with strength—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But she also said this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She crossed her hands over and grabbed the swords by her waist. The twin swords were unsheathed with a &lt;em&gt;swish&lt;/em&gt;. They looked like ordinary longswords on the surface. However, they were dripping with blood despite being revealed to the world only now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin swords looked incredibly ominous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A salmon swimming upstream cannot change the flow of water, no matter how much it rampages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, neatly bringing her legs together in the air, Twisted Kindness held the twin swords in a reverse grip and slowly raised her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right. No matter how incredible of a constellation you are—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing just like a cross…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, you will only be one of the many Stars in the vast universe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She spread out her wings in full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heaven and Earth, All Creation."&lt;span id="footnote-ref-3343"&gt;&lt;a href="#footnote-3343"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And simultaneously looking down at Seol Jihu, her pupils abruptly slit open vertically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will put everything on the line and return you to the void!"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, at the Tigol Fortress, the Federation was in a bloody battle that the word 'horrific' could not even begin to describe. One would be able to smell the blood just by looking at the gruesome sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mess started from the walls. All sorts of flying creatures were rampaging in the sky. Although the Beastmen ran around brandishing their sharp claws and the Cave Fairies fought back by launching themselves into the air, they were at odds against the sheer number of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how many they killed, there was no end in sight. Even the sky looked black from the swarm of parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aaaack!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, a Cave Fairy, stabbed by the claws of a pterosaur, was pulled into the sky, screaming. When the pterosaur dropped her, she fell while flailing her arms until she hit the ground and shattered her bones and organs. Her ruined body soon became food for the starving parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the walls being like this, the sight below was even more of a spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corpses were piled up on top of each other, forming an enormous mountain. And swarming corpses and parasites were stepping on this mountain to climb up like a rising tide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over there!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop them! Stop theeeeem!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sky Fairies were madly firing one arrow after the other, but it was futile in the face of such an overwhelming number. In fact, they only became targets for the Evil Phantoms that sniped them from a distance, and their perforated bodies fell and became part of the mountain of corpses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the situation being like this, it was only natural for the defending Federation members to contact the higher-ups for reinforcements every minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"T-The Thunder is ready!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Thunder arrived at the perfect moment. It was crafted by the Dwarves only a moment ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuk…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel bit her lower lip. Though this was good news, she fully knew it would only extinguish the fire for a moment. It would blaze up again once the Nests and reproductive species gave birth to new soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the reason that the five armies had yet to join the battle. With the World Tree gone, the Thunder was the only way the Federation could 'somewhat' deal with the Army Commanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federation knew this as well, and that was why they tried their hardest to procure as many of them as possible. Still…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Damn it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were starting to run low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that didn't mean they could sit back and watch the current development continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging that there was no other choice, Gabriel clenched her teeth and shouted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Detonate the Thunder!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the order fell, a thunderous explosion burst out from every direction of the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sky regained its original color as the black creatures filling the sky were wiped away by a blue ray of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that only lasted a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, new troops flooded in from the distance like hail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they did not have the time to despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The western wall…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The eastern watchtower fell! We need to send reinforcements as soon as possible…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requests for reinforcements came from every side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel couldn't blame them. The harsh reality was that every place was on the brink of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was that she had no means to help. She had run out of reinforcements to send and Thunders to detonate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'So this is it…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was easy to see. She could tell just by looking at the wall right in front of her. The corpses of the Federation army were sprawled everywhere, and it was rare to see anyone standing in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'There's… there's no way out…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staring blankly at the sky as it darkened once more, Gabriel gently closed her eyes. She could finally see the end that seemed far out of reach at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Should we retreat?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, such thought crossed her mind, fully knowing what would happen to Paradise once they gave up on Tigol Fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment Gabriel opened her closed eyes and meekly gazed beyond the fortress…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corpse army had stopped its march. The parasites had also stopped and were turning their bodies in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just what happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gabriel reflexively turned in the direction that the enemy was facing, she became dazed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the distant mountain ridge, shadows began to appear one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ppooooooo—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the sound of a bugle rang out in the next moment, the battlefield turned silent in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she noticed, the shadows stretched horizontally and filled the entire mountain ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ppoooooo—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sound of a bugle echoed out once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gabriel snapped out of her daze, she heard the sound of footsteps running toward her in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urgent news! Urgent news!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sky Fairy that rushed toward her prostrated before Gabriel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The communication…! The communication line reconnected!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Communication line?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel asked back in a daze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes! Eva has sent reinforcements…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Beastman whose fur was drenched in blood asked in disbelief. He couldn't be blamed as humanity had turned a blind eye while the Beastman Alliance collapsed and had refused every request the Federation made thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eva sent reinforcements? Impossible! You must be joking!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Beastman asked again, the Sky Fairy raised her trembling arm. Above her palm was a communication crystal that was lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surrounding gazes all gathered on the crystal ball, which was showing a cavalry standing in straight lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel's eyes widened. If her eyes weren't lying to her, the person standing at the head of the army was a human. A human riding a horse, her pink hair fluttering in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really is…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beastman shut his mouth. They had been on the verge of despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…It's not just Eva."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sniffling of the Sky Fairy broke the silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Odor, Grazia, Caligo, and Haramark all sent reinforcements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With teary eyes…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, these five cities have issued draft calls to all Earthlings. Even Executors came. Three of them!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And trembling lips…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The humans have… sent reinforcements!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking around at the higher-ups who were still in disbelief…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Humanity…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a voice choked with tears, she spoke again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…has answered the Federation's call for help!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fuse of war that was on the brink of blowing out was rekindled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"You guys…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sacrifice your bodies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go die, I mean. Hurry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirits fell into disarray at Little Chick's words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[H-Huh? Just like that?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a question was about to come out, Little Chick raised its voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought I made this clear! I don't have any time to explain!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[B-But…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why? Are you suddenly afraid of death?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[What did you say!?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick's mocking comment angered the Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless you're complete idiots, you must know why only the two of us came here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T-That's…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The humans who came to help you are fighting with their lives on the line. They are relying on us to succeed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[….]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you really want an explanation, I'll give it to you. But just know this. The longer we take, the higher the probability of us failing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirits fell silent at Little Chick's intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's your decision?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Little Chick urged for an answer…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…We just have to go fight?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Spirit carefully asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. Fight. Fight to the bitter end. Even if you die, don't die so easily. Resist until the very last moment. Resist, and resist again! Only then can you die. Make sure they are solely focused on you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[That's all we need to do?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's enough. It's also the only thing you guys can do. Now hurry!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Little Chick's urging, the Spirits turned around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And soon…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Iyaaaaaaa!]&lt;br/&gt;[Uwaaaaah!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirits gathered at the center of this world began to charge toward the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the Nests began to react. They must have seen the Spirits flying in from all directions as hundreds of tentacles resting on the surface of the lake shot up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea watched the battle at the lake unfold with a look of devastation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This couldn't even be called a battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirits were being slaughtered by the tentacles and dropping like flies. No matter how he looked at it, it was closer to a one-sided massacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oi, Archer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick spoke to him at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hear your sniping skills are top-notch. Archer of Steel is your title, isn't it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, Marcel Ghionea got down on the ground amidst the chaos. Not only was it too late to turn back, but he also realized what Little Chick was trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good. Then before you nock your arrow, tie the things you got from Partner to the arrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…The seed and the sedges?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If my prediction is correct, the Spirit Kings should be inside those Nests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea flinched while preparing to snipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm certain. I heard that monster mention an experiment. The Parasites must have concocted a plan that uses the Spirits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, the experiment most likely must be the Parasitization of Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No way…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea's face distorted. That was one thing that should not be allowed. They had to stop it no matter what!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If their plan ends in success, the outcome will be devastating. But it looks like they haven't succeeded yet. This might be our chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chance?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea asked as he tightly tied the seed and the sedges to his arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick pointed at the middle of the five Nests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the main body is still remaining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You mean the World Tree is still alive?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I never said that. I said it's remaining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no need to think so hard. Imagine that there is a dead person in front of you. But we have a miracle potion that can revive the dead. Then all we need to do is feed the potion to the dead person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea finally understood what Little Chick was asking from him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wanted him to shoot an arrow tied to the seed and the sedges and hit the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't that he didn't have questions. All sorts of possibilities flashed by his head. Even if the World Tree revived, what if the Nests surrounding it got stronger as a result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…So."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All I have to do is hit the mark?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as you can make the arrow dig into it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those words were enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea nocked the arrow and readied his posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he was going to do this, it was better to get it over with as soon as possible. After all, the chances of them being discovered would go up as the number of Spirits dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in truth, this was a near-impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting a stationary target was nothing difficult, but the path his arrow needed to take to get there was too steep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did it need to break through the hundreds of tentacles flying about in the air, but it also had to miss the Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the finals of a soccer game drawing the eyes of the entire world, a professional player going into overtime after completing forty-five minutes of the second half at a 2:3 disadvantage, and then stepping onto the penalty box for a game-deciding goal— could this be what he feels then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An immense pressure pressed down on Marcel Ghionea. However, this wasn't a matter where he could ask if he could do it. No, it was a matter that he &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to do it, a matter that &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Marcel Ghionea shook off any idle thoughts. Once he emptied his mind and focused, every cell in his body woke up and wriggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he slowly breathed in, the cold air seeped into his lungs and turned his body cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, everything became faint. The sounds agitating his mind scattered away, and the tentacles throwing his narrowed eyes into chaos hazily changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, the moment a withered tree filled his sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment his restrained breath leaked out and halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment his hair slightly blew in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subdued breath, an unshaking hand, and a gently blowing wind, the moment everything perfectly fell into place, Marcel Ghionea's right eye shot open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, his ice-cold finger let go of the bowstring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ping!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a short sonic wave, the mastlike arrow shot forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a fantastic shot without even the slightest trembling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In place of Seol Jihu and the expedition team, the arrow of steel carrying the wish of the Federation and humanity flew toward the World Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id="footnote-3343"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I'm fairly confident these are the names of her twin swords (though it's never clarified or explained). &lt;a href="#footnote-ref-3343"&gt;&lt;i class="far fa-hand-point-left"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-329"&gt;

Awakening, the Last Stand (3)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-329</link><description>&lt;p&gt;"Euaaaaahhhhhhhh!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu rushed forward while letting out a bellow full of rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness, who had succeeded in grasping her hand around Baek Haeju's tender neck, glanced back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She returned to look at the struggling Baek Haeju in her grasp. Her face remained indifferent as if his actions didn't warrant her interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, her indifferent attitude only lasted a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her eyes widened when she felt the energy behind her back increase exponentially. The moment she looked back with a frown, the spear that had been aimed at her suddenly slashed in the shape of the number 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness blinked her eyes and tossed Baek Haeju away. She then stepped on the ground, hard enough to make a small crater, and with a strong gust of wind, she began to display a splendid footwork technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She smoothly deflected the spear that cut at her from all directions and narrowed the distance with a zigzag movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shwick!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as she did so, the spear's trajectory suddenly changed. The spear that had been slicing down suddenly switched into an upwards diagonal cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Twisted Kindness urgently leaned backward, the spear's blade brushed past her chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her face was full of surprise. The punk couldn't even see her movements before, so how was he suddenly predicting her movements and launching accurate attacks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What happened?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness expressed her confusion while brandishing her tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment that her swishing tail was about to smack into him like a whip, Seol Jihu kicked off the ground while a tri-circular shield formed on his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He narrowly deflected the tail by twisting his left arm before flying up like a butterfly and drawing back his right arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Twisted Kindness, who had been standing in front of him, suddenly vanished before appearing again behind Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as she was about to chop at his neck with the blade of her hand…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…She felt an impact strike up her chin, catching her unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pak!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her head thrown back from the blow, Twisted Kindness quickly shifted her feet and retreated. After allowing a hit for the first time, she stared in disbelief at Seol Jihu, who lightly landed on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she didn't see wrong, Seol Jihu had instantaneously flicked his arm to twist his spear mid-swing, all the while having his gaze fixed forward. That was how she was struck with the butt of the spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Hoh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this, she was now certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was seeing her movements. No, she wasn't sure whether he could read her movements correctly, but she was certain that he was sensing them and chasing after her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This is strange. A bit too strange.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wanted to ask what was going on, but Seol Jihu was already on the move. He kicked off the ground and sharply rushed at her as soon as he landed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Should I test him out?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After blocking his attack with a swing of her arm, Twisted Kindness retreated backward while carefully observing her opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle soon resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu immediately chased after her and aimed his spear at her lower body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the obvious attack, Twisted Kindness raised her foot. She intended to stomp him to the ground along with his spear, but the spear suddenly shifted from a forward thrust to an upward cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Seol Jihu busied his hands, the spear drew a large circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness instinctively drew her head back, only to find a golden sword qi strengthened with rotational momentum sharply sweeping past the tip of her nose. As she dodged out of the way, the spear immediately made a 180 degrees rotation before the butt of the spear came flying towards her temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Twisted Kindness could only retreat again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all. Seol Jihu quickly narrowed the distance as if he didn't want to relent his chain of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment the spearhead cycled and pointed towards the ground, he gripped the spear in a throwing stance and powerfully jabbed it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness hastily lowered her waist to the lower-left direction to avoid the attack before diagonally twisting it to the right as she swung her arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmmp!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She flung her elbow out with the intention of bursting his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they were in such close proximity to each other, Seol Jihu had no choice but to avoid it by bending back his waist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that, his stance was momentarily broken. Just when Twisted Kindness noticed this and was about to execute her flashy footwork again….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kwang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ground suddenly shook as if the earth was churning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness was stopped in her steps. She had tried to hook his leg to make him lose his balance, but Seol Jihu had powerfully slammed down his spear as if telling her to fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when he succeeded in preventing her from hooking his legs, his spear shot toward her neck like a viper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness kicked up with her leg. Her kick precisely hit the shaft of the spear, making the spearhead draw a sharp curve as it was flung up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she was watching out in case it would strike down again, Twisted Kindness suddenly raised her eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's arm, which had been raised up towards the sky, suddenly bent. Following the motions of his arm, the spear rotated and landed on his shoulders before it was aimed at her again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, he extended his arm forward and charged at her again, simultaneously placing his tri-circular shield in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was truly a relentless series of attacks that didn't allow his opponent to breathe!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expressing her slight irritation, Twisted Kindness skillfully used her leg that she had raised up. She squeezed the spear between her calf and her hamstring and forcibly drove it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spear stabbed into the ground as it was forcefully slammed down by her dreadful leg strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Twisted Kindness immediately loosened her leg and hit the spear shaft with her knee, the spearhead was driven deeper into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that same time, she gruffly grabbed the diagonally standing shaft with her left hand. Using it as a pivot, she lowered her body and strongly punched out with her right arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes widened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment she was convinced she got him—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ray of light rushed at her side with a terrifying force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clicking her tongue, Twisted Kindness quickly swung the hand that she meant to twist Seol Jihu's neck with. And borrowing that twisting momentum, she heavily swung her tail as hard as she could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Puk!&lt;/em&gt; When she checked the situation after feeling a solid hit, she saw a man and a woman sliding back from the blow on her front and left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the culprit that made her miss her chance was Baek Haeju. Seol Jihu, who had his arms crossed in front of him, was seen slowly lowering his arms while rubbing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spectacular series of attacks and defense had occurred in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness smacked her lips while seeing Seol Jihu collect his breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a great reaction on her part considering the sudden attack, but she unfortunately couldn't accomplish her goal of capturing her opponent. A gap had been created due to the sudden attack, allowing Seol Jihu a chance to react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, she made some gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, hmmmmm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glancing sideways at the Spear of Purity stuck on the ground, Twisted Kindness asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happened?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your movements improved too much. It's almost incomparable to before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why didn't you fight like this sooner? Did you purposely hide your ability? No, that shouldn't be the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling her body slightly warmed up, her words became faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Speak. Did some kind of change happen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing Twisted Kindness press him, Seol Jihu, who had been collecting his breath, spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I tell you…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He paused before licking his lips and continuing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Will you give us a chance to rest?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thinking about it again, I feel like it'd be a waste not to take you up on your offer from before. I'm asking whether you'll let us rest if I change my mind now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ahahaha! You truly are an unpredictable man!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She burst into loud laughter before shaking her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll dampen my excitement a little, but fine. If you can satisfy my curiosity, then I am willing to accept it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course. If I can enjoy another life or death fight as interesting as before, then there is no reason for me not to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness generously continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, hurry up and speak. I wouldn't have even asked if you had used a simple awakening skill to momentarily increase your energy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But that's not it. You became too different. It's a phenomenon that I truly can't understand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Seol Jihu didn't easily answer her. His quickly darting eyes seemed to be conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can I really trust you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What if you attack me after I tell you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hah. Have you been fooled your whole life? Haven't I sworn using my name? If you really doubt me that much, then take your break now. It doesn't matter if you tell me after you rest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The conditions are too good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After giving the Spear of Purity a slight nudge, Twisted Kindness stepped forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll return your weapon once I hear your reply. You might not tell me once you rest after all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu nodded his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't know what she meant by swearing using her name, but he acted convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good, then…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu was still vigilant as he slowly knelt on one knee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness shrugged her shoulders before straightening her posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu let out a deep sigh before quietly speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes. First?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as Twisted Kindness repeated his word with twinkling eyes…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes widened. At the same moment, he bolted forward like a professional sprinter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness scowled when she felt the wind mixed with thick killing intent. Not mentioning the fact that he attacked when he said he was going to rest, she wondered what he was going to do rushing in barehanded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, she could feel a sudden rise of energy behind her. It was a holy power that was so powerful that it stung her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Twisted Kindness reflexively turned around, she became greatly astonished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spear of Purity that was stuck in the ground was now floating in the air. As if that wasn't enough, it was currently flying in a straight line towards her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crescent Blade Spear Technique, Second Ultimate Art — Flying Spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp and acute sensation quickly approached her as if it intended to pierce through her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greatly surprised, Twisted Kindness hastily assumed her stance. However, at that moment…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uryaah!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who had recklessly charged at her, accelerated and slammed his shoulders into her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment Twisted Kindness realized her mistake, her balance had already been broken. But when the Spear of Purity headed straight towards where her face was as she tripped forwards…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You punk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she shouted in rage, a pair of wings spread wide open, directly propelling her up in her collapsed posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness felt a burning sensation narrowly brushing past her abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when she tried to circle around in the sky and steady herself, she felt her entire body go stiff. She only realized after she was airborne that the entire sky was crisscrossed in white wires like a spiderweb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on top of the wires was Baek Haeju, who jumped up one step ahead of her, ready to strike her Tathagata Spear down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'No way—'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she could finish that thought, Baek Haeju swung both her arms down in full force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' face turned dazed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was because she felt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just the spiderweb and Baek Haeju. The Spear of Purity that she thought had missed was pointing upright and flying straight at her as if it was homing in on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Seol Jihu kicked off the ground and jumped up to grab the flying spear, the spear erupted with a golden energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above her was the Tathagata Spear slashing down while wrapped in a green sword qi; and below her was the Spear of Purity with added momentum, piercing towards her as if to pierce even the sky itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' mouth gaped open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in that split second moment—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kwoooooo!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She roared furiously while releasing a powerful energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After confronting them with just her physical strength all this time, she finally decided to use her energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Straight, go straight ahead just like this! I said to go faster!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea was currently running at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given his personality, it was something he would normally never do, but Seol Jihu's command and the situation forced him to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, he wouldn't have been of much help even if he stayed. But if he was successful in this mission, the whole situation would turn around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea believed in those words and used his mana to sprint crazily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much time went by?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as his forehead was full of sweat and a sweet taste could be felt in his mouth, he began to hear a commotion off in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There they are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick, who had been hustling Marcel Ghionea from the top of his head, spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it said, the source of the noise was a gathering of Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they were many in number, they seemed to be huddled together, unable to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop here. Don't go too close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea stopped. When he panted and wiped the sweat flowing down his face, he suddenly heard a small gasp from the top of his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea became perplexed when he lifted his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"W-What? What are Nests doing here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In front of him was a huge lake. Though it may have looked beautiful in the past, the lake was now black, polluted with wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lying inside the lake half-submerged were none other than Nests. To be more precise, five enormous Nests, boasting a size bigger than most buildings, were surrounding a withered tree, each having a few tentacles attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the bulging of their bumpy surfaces, it was certain that they were alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nests? Are those what you call Nests?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait. Wait a moment. They're different from normal Nests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the questioning of Little Chick, Marcel Ghionea hurriedly inspected the Nests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He soon figured out the difference. It wasn't just their stupidly large sizes. Their colors were different as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surface of normal Nests was mostly gray. However, the Nests that were submerged in the lake were dyed in five colors: dark-red, water-blue, jade-green, clay-brown, and sky-blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Speak. What's different?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Marcel Ghionea explained to Little Chick, the Spirits noticed their arrival and rushed toward them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[How did it go? Why did only the two of you come?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Are they still fighting? They're not dead, right? Right?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Spirits grew loud…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quiet!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Little Chick snapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surroundings quickly became silent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick folded its tiny wings and fell into thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it. I was wondering why there weren't any troops protecting this place … the Nests themselves are pretty strong…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I-I felt it. They all went towards that direction, right? Should we go and attack them?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't be ridiculous. None of you will survive even a single sweep of her hand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Then what are we supposed to do!? You said we didn't have much time! Tell us what to do, quick!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They weren't wrong. Although Little Chick gave Seol Jihu its power, even Little Chick could tell that Twisted Kindness wasn't using her full strength. It was unknown how long the expedition team would hold out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn't any time to think. No, even if they did, they would need to first take action before finding a solution. The situation was simply that urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…I guess there's no choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick smacked its mouth before sneaking a glance at the Spirits. Then, it spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You guys…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-328"&gt;

Awakening, the Last Stand (2)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-328</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' aura changed in an instant. The energy enshrouding her like a fog suddenly materialized and began to blaze as though a bucket of oil had been poured on top of a fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu frowned, feeling a heavy pressure crushing down on his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her intent was clear. She was saying she would no longer go easy on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu aimed the Spear of Purity forward and waited for an attack. Truthfully speaking, just confronting Twisted Kindness filled him with fright. He was very much tempted to just run away. But the moment he did such a thing, he knew that everything he had built up until now would crumble down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of despair, lacking any semblance of hope, Seol Jihu focused to get hold of himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would Twisted Kindness attack? It looked like she had a special ability other than her physical power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then again, could he deal with her even if she used her physical power alone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All sorts of thoughts crossed Seol Jihu's mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Twisted Kindness lightly kicked off the ground. She closed the distance between them before Seol Jihu could even blink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite being astonished at her speed, Seol Jihu managed to reflexively thrust forward, having expected this to a certain degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Twisted Kindness dodged the attack by turning her waist slightly and reached out with her hand like lightning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your first move was very disappointing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment her voice reached his ears, Seol Jihu immediately ducked and dodged the hand that was trying to seize him. And at the same time, he cut up vertically with his spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the short distance between them, he figured it would be impossible to dodge this attack. He had confidence that the Spear of Purity would hit its mark this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the next moment, Seol Jihu realized his preconceptions were all meaningless. It was because Twisted Kindness spread her wings instantaneously and flew up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her reaction speed was too shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm. There is just no way Undying Diligence would have lost to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calm evaluation continued. As her shadow cast over Seol Jihu, he reflexively roused his mana. Electricity crackled beneath his feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His brain sent warning signals, telling him to get far away, but he shook them off forcefully. Now that he decided to fight, backing off was no longer an option. He had to clash with his enemy head-on without leaving behind any spare energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, he leaped up into the air in full force and stabbed with his spear. With an explosive &lt;em&gt;pang!&lt;/em&gt;, Twisted Kindness' figure disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu subsequently felt something approaching from behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Shoot!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu quickly swung the Spear of Purity behind him. However, Twisted Kindness worked her legs with an indifferent face, and she moved glidingly while drawing a crescent line. Just like that, she positioned herself at Seol Jihu's flank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu became dazed, feeling like he was fighting a ghost. He still turned his body and reacted, but Twisted Kindness moved her arm as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment he saw her forearm, his ribs were struck with a dull pain. And by the time he felt this pain, Twisted Kindness' forearm had broken past the barrier around his ribcage and dug into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kuk—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that instant, something that burst inside him almost came out of his throat through his esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu barely swallowed it back down and tried to collect his thoughts, but before he could do anything, he was struck with another dull pain on top of his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Cough!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood spurted out from his nose and mouth. As his consciousness began to dim, Jang Maldong's voice rang out in his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Get it together!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A frustrated scolding ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[What happened to the log training you did!?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I told you not to hit after you see, perceive, and then think! Hit as soon as you see it! Move using your intuition!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A true expert will land a successful attack before you can perceive it! By the time you try to move, your head would already be in the air!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was just like he'd said. Seol Jihu couldn't see Twisted Kindness' movements at all. Since he couldn't even see it, perceiving it and thinking about it was out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant he would have to predict her movements and move intuitively… but the enemy's movements surpassed his expectations completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same even now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he could even attempt anything, a light flashed in front of his eyes. Since a burning sensation was spreading out from his nose, it seemed he just received a good punch in the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Damn it, damn it!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking that he couldn't just take a one-sided beating, he followed his instincts and thrust his spear indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he couldn't feel a single hit connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Intuition was ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of wasting his precious turns was, of course, a bitter counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He felt a sharp, stinging sensation on his neck. Although he used Flash Thunder and hurriedly rushed back, the impact still struck a blow to his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu screamed internally as he felt his clavicles break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This….'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His head tilted back. He unknowingly took in a deep breath, and the foul stench of blood flowed into his nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's body staggered. What was driving him even crazier was that consecutive strikes came pouring in before he could even find his balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a one-sided pummeling ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times was he hit in this short instant? Ten times? Twenty times?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if there was one thing he knew for certain, it was that his senses were becoming faint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'No…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having lost its strength at a rapid rate, his body swayed. But as he was doing a double-take, he suffered yet another blow. This time, from the bottom to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His faltering body returned to its standing posture following his enemy's will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disappointed voice rang out in his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This really is your true strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the pain of his internal organs buzzing, his vision became slightly clear. And what Seol Jihu saw in the next moment was a single palm accompanying an immense aura, slithering in like a snake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had no means to dodge it, nor the strength to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Puk.&lt;/em&gt; The palm clashed with his chest. The front of his coat exploded, and a palm-shaped mark dug into his chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightning flashed in front of his eyes. Seol Jihu briefly lost consciousness as his body was sent flying from the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'…Huh?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he recovered his senses, a red sky was spread out before him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His body was flying through the air. And soon, it slammed down on the ground like a used-up mop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a near-endless period of pain, Seol Jihu could collapse at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at the end, awaited death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness appeared above Seol Jihu, who was gasping for breath with great difficulty. Looking down with a gaze that clearly lost all interest, Twisted Kindness slowly raised her foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exterminating the First Army Commander… I will chalk it up to a series of perfect circumstances, human."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with a voice full of disappointment, she slammed her foot down without hesitation. It fell, shattering layers after layers of barriers like glass plates, until—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Euuuuuu!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's body was suddenly pulled back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cloud of black smoke was coiled around his armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Twisted Kindness' foot smashed Seol Jihu's head, Flone had taken hold of him and escaped at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she couldn't help but gape her mouth in shock in the next moment, as Twisted Kindness immediately caught up to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't get cheeky and hand him over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Hiik!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone shut her eyes, seeing Twisted Kindness appear next to her in an instant. As a fist carrying a terrifying aura hurled out toward the two of them, a large, swirling green light cut in between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PANG!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two auras clashed violently. The shockwave of the impact sent Seol Jihu and Flone flying while Baek Haeju was also pushed back weakly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Twisted Kindness, she stopped chasing after Seol Jihu and paused when she saw the distinct green light wavering around Baek Haeju's body. After carefully observing it, she let loose a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Awakening… No, you forcefully let it rampage. You would even bet your life on this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju quickly picked herself back up, then reflexively covered her mouth. She felt something rising from her stomach and wanted to vomit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, Twisted Kindness clicked her tongue with pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I applaud you for wanting to save a comrade… But you should know. Even if you consume your life like this, you will only be dragging out the inevitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju did not reply. She only glanced behind her and clenched her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm… fine. At least you'll be able to entertain me for a bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not expecting anything from Seol Jihu any longer, Twisted Kindness took her mind off him and cracked her neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To show my respect for your life-blazing fighting spirit, I will play along."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, two huge auras clashed fiercely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Seol Jihu was lying in a dazed state. The red sky of the Spirit Realm had turned even redder from the fresh blood dyeing his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while looking up at the sky endlessly, he suddenly felt his body turn warm. A white light was enveloping him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'A healing spell…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He felt his body recover slightly, but what followed was an indescribable pain. His sense of pain had returned as he healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Huuuuaaaaaaaaa!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would have screamed his head off if he could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sorry state that his body was in made him want to prefer death. While he had yet to take a closer look, he could tell easily just by seeing Seo Yuhui chanting a spell in shock and Maria splashing healing potions on him while crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time this pain barely subsided, he was overcome with dejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't even feel like he had a fierce fight. He failed to make a single proper attack. He was just… beaten one-sidedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recalling the previous fight, fear crept up and crawled on his skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Insane… this is absolutely insane…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He finally realized why Baek Haeju urged everyone to escape the moment Twisted Kindness appeared. He also learned the significance of fully absorbing a god's divinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness was simply an unparalleled monster. In his current state, he wouldn't come out victorious even if he had a hundred lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, a brilliant light spread out from Seo Yuhui's hand, which was placed on top of Seol Jihu's chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…up!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ears started working again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get up! Get up, you son of a bitch!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria was shouting while crying a river. She seemed to be getting angry to cope with the fact that everyone would probably die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed that his sense of hearing had recovered following his sense of pain as he could faintly hear loud ringing from a far distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why!? Why can't you fight as you did back then!? Why are you getting beaten so miserably!? You overwhelmed three Commanders back then!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu blinked slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Future Vision….'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chuckle escaped his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he could, he would have used it a long time ago. However, Future Vision was an ability that activated at random. Although it saved his life on several occasions, he knew it would be wishful thinking to expect it to activate whenever he was in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Right, he knew that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now that the situation had come to this, he couldn't help but put his hope in Future Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'…Fuck….'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while thinking this, a curse came out by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had sworn never to rely on this ability ever again. He almost cried for being so pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it was always like this. No matter how much effort he put in or how much he struggled, the result was always the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enemy always forced difficult trials and tribulations upon him as if to mock and laugh at his struggles. Even when he broke through them by risking his life, only bigger despair would be waiting for him on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was no different this time. In the end, nothing had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did what I could.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've had enough. It's exhausting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'No!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu clenched his teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't come to the Spirit Realm to have such miserable thoughts! It wouldn't be too late to have regrets &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; he was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, he had to find a way, even if he had to clutch at straws!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He heard a youthful voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick had gotten on top of his body before he noticed. It looked down at Seol Jihu's face, peering through the blood drenching it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you going to do? I understand. You've come all this way, so obviously it would be a waste to give up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But why don't you lower your head and beg? Who knows, maybe that monster will accept your sincerity and give you a chance to rest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes shot open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was that something to say in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu glared at the smirking Little Chick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why? I think it's a decent way out. You'll get to keep your life at the very least."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shut… up…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu muttered in a cold voice and scowled in the next moment. He had tried to raise his upper body but was met with an acute pain that made him shiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His body was still refusing to listen to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm. I thought it was a kind offer though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So what, you won't accept that monster's offer even if you die? Do you have any bright ideas?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…I said, shut up…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling a vicious glare, Little Chick snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What a scary face! Anyway, if you're out of ideas…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, it grinned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why don't you hear me out, partner?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You see, I agree with you. Something didn't sit right with me. I could tell something fishy was going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick's attitude suddenly changed. Its smirking expression disappeared and was replaced by a serious look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Listen, things aren't looking good right now. I'm sure you know that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its black pupils glinted with a firm resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll save you the boring explanation, so pay attention. Right now, a considerable number of Spirits are gathered at the central area of the Spirit Realm. I can feel their auras. The younguns we met must have brought other Spirits. They seem to have realized we're in a battle and are debating whether to come help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those Spirits…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But they must not come here. They won't change a thing. I'm sure you know why."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick spoke clearly in a subdued voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I will go over to them. But I'm going to need you to lend me an Archer, one who's quick on their feet. It would be nice if that person is good with the bow as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…You're going?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. I'll go there and find a way out. You have to stay here until then and hold that monster down. Both monsters, in fact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu blinked rapidly. He didn't understand what Little Chick meant by all this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he didn't have the time to ask for details. He could feel Little Chick's will, the will of the Arcus Spirit swearing to overturn this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So? Do you think you can do it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu thought for a moment before shaking his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, he was about to shake his head. But he couldn't bring it upon himself to ruin a plan before it even started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's just a bit…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hilarious!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick snorted immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's the point in acting tough? It's not like I didn't see that monster beating the living hell out of you. How are you going to last? You don't even know how long it'll take."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu was taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…To be honest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick sighed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't really like you all that much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave a rather out of the blue evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seemed it wasn't expecting a reply as it turned around and quickly moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never seen someone so selfish in my entire life. All the achievements you've made so far only stemmed from you trying to protect your place of escape. And at other times, you act like a total manchild…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trotting lightly, it crossed its right wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But, I'll admit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where it stopped was none other than Seol Jihu's right hand. In this hand was the Spear of Purity, which he refused to let go even in his current state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're a hell of a lot better than people who stop at thinking and never carry it out in action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick raised its foot and wiped away the blood on the upper section of the spear shaft, or, more specifically, where seven concave holes were located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And more importantly…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, it glanced back. Gazing at the slightly dazed Seol Jihu, it grinned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really like your refusal to give up. You burn your fighting spirit even in such a wretched state. At the very least, your fighting spirit surpasses the First Clan Head."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, Little Chick pulled out the three feathers on its forehead. They were yellow, green, and blue feathers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consider yourself lucky. You can even consider it an honor. Until now, I've never released more than two Authorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Holding your fighting spirit in high regard, I'll give you a pass, partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Seol Jihu could say anything, Little Chick threw the feathers, which descended while swaying in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the moment they gently landed on the Spear of Purity…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woooong!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vigorous sound resounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the three colors instantly dyed the Spear of Purity, Seol Jihu was startled by his own right hand, which began to shake like a coiling dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all. An unfamiliar, beautiful voice filled his ears. It whispered soft words that he couldn't make out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This is…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu subconsciously cupped his hand over his ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looks like you can finally hear it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick lifted its chin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the Spear of Purity talking to you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Spear of Purity?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right, partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick nodded and continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Spear of Purity has been talking to you ever since you awakened it. Even in the previous fight, it was screaming and yelling in despair. You never heard a thing though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu glanced at the Spear of Purity with a renewed gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having regained its true color before he noticed, the Spear of Purity was radiating a much clearer and intense light. It was the type of noble, solemn light that didn't give off a single impurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as Little Chick said, Seol Jihu began to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woong—! Woong—!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why can't you use me better? No weapon is my match when it comes to annihilating evil— Please use me properly!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woong—!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could hear the Spear of Purity being upset and lamenting Seol Jihu's improper use of the spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, Seol Jihu tightly gripped the Spear of Purity as though he had been bewitched. As he roused the tiny stream of mana flowing in his body…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spear of Purity resonated and spat out a previously nonexistent cry. At the same time, Seol Jihu's eyes shot open, feeling a boundless power sweeping over from his right hand like a raging hail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a powerful aura he had never felt before in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As several alarms struck his ears, his eyes shot open and exploded out with elegant light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Miss Maria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spoke to the dazedly staring Maria with a subdued voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Call Mister Marcel Ghionea over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And raising his shaking hand, it drew the Spear of Purity at Twisted Kindness, the enemy moving in to finish off Baek Haeju.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being swept away by her huge, merciless torrent of despair and frantically struggling to escape—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Crescent Blade Spear Technique, First Ultimate Art — One with the Spear — has been awakened.]&lt;br/&gt;[Crescent Blade Spear Technique, Second Ultimate Art — Flying Spear — has been awakened.]&lt;br/&gt;[Crescent Blade Spear Technique, Third Ultimate Art — Formless Spear — has been awakened.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, he managed to clutch onto a straw. A slightly tough, durable straw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as Twisted Kindness tried to seize Baek Haeju's neck after striking her Tathagata Spear up—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HUAAAAAAAA—!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to withstand the surging power, Seol Jihu bellowed his heart out and rushed forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-327"&gt;

Awakening, the Last Stand (1)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-327</link><description>&lt;p&gt;"Uhahaha! Yes! That's it! That's the face I wanted to see!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn that was on the verge of death, guffawed jubilantly. Like a donkey in a lion's skin, it borrowed the true Commander's power to hold its head high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Unicorn's laughter didn't last long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a simple reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good! Twisted Kindness! Teach these treacherous, impertinent inse—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thwack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was sent flying in the middle of his diatribe and made to tumble on the ground in an unsightly fashion, not by anyone from the expedition team, but by his fellow Army Commander, Twisted Kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'She attacked him?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu doubted his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance snapped out of its daze and also stared dumbfoundedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is the meaning of this!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shut it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cold voice cut him off. When Twisted Kindness looked down with a chilling gaze, the Unicorn quickly shrunk back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A weakling like you dares to order me around?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Damn it! I'm not ordering you! I was talking as a fellow ally, who also serves the Queen!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ally?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness raised her eye. She looked as though she just heard the funniest joke of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazing at Raging Temperance, she broke out into laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't look like you have the slightest clue why the Queen threw you in here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How ridiculous! You actually have the galls to say that in your sorry state? Your actions are riddled with self-righteousness and egotism, so how can you shamelessly call yourself an ally?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You damned lizard…! I came here to conquer this realm under the Queen's order!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fufu, I don't care if you hurt your mouth, but talk properly. I'm the one who invaded and conquered the Spirit Realm, not you. Do you realize how laughable those words are when all you've done is clean up remnants of the enemy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn shut its mouth. Its face turned purple with rage, but it couldn't find the words to retort with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not all. If you'd acknowledged your limits and formed a proper army as the Queen suggested, I would have acknowledged you as an ally. But—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness paused for a moment, looked back and forth between the expedition team and the Unicorn, then snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You tried to imitate me and ended up ripping your crotch. That is why you are in such a pathetic state, o insignificant creature of the Spiritual Dimension."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With such an obvious weakness, don't you feel ashamed calling yourself an Army Commander?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness clicked her tongue and shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Queen is keeping you by her side only because she thinks highly of your experimental mind. Otherwise, she would have replaced you long ago. Have some shame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn lowered its head at the continued barrage of criticisms. Rather than agreeing and self-reflecting on them, it was very obviously wrought in a sense of inferiority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness shook her head as if she didn't have any expectations in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyway, the Spirit Realm is now within my jurisdiction. Don't butt in without my permission. No, maybe it wouldn't be bad if you did. That way, I'd finally have a reason to execute you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After threatening the panting Unicorn, Twisted Kindness threw her gaze to the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition team was quietly watching the two Army Commanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running away was obviously impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn't say a single word, tired from the recent short but fierce battle. Now that Twisted Kindness had made her appearance, they knew fighting would be the same as hitting a rock with an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they had no intention of giving up so easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To recover the strength to fight, each breath was of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When their eyes met the formidable enemy in front of them, the tension they were feeling multiplied by at least a dozen times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, to their surprise, Twisted Kindness did not immediately make a move. She stared at the expedition team while tilting her head…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…You all don't look so good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, she suddenly descended and sat down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was she doing sitting rather than fighting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone held their breaths at the enemy's unexpected action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bombshell dropped in the next moment. No, her tone was too calm to call it a bombshell, but it certainly shook the expedition team with shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"W-What did you say?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the Unicorn that was keeping its mouth shut after Twisted Kindness' intimidation, spoke up in shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"R-Rest? Did you finally go cra— Aaaaack!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scream burst out before it could even finish speaking. Twisted Kindness had waved her hand as though she was too lazy to deal with it, and the Unicorn's stomach exploded and spilled out internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Y-Youuuuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn screamed in indignation, but quickly fell silent upon seeing Twisted Kindness' hand moving slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…What a shame. If only you uttered another word, I could have killed you once and for all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed she wasn't kidding when she said she would execute him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn slammed its head on the ground and gritted its teeth viciously. While this would normally be a comedic scene that would make its audience burst out in a peal of laughter, no one found it funny with Twisted Kindness being the host of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could feel a sense of absolute authority from her words, the kind that would let her get away with saying or doing whatever she wished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this the majesty of an absolute being?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that I think about it…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness ignored the groaning Unicorn thoroughly and said as she stared at the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You humans were a cumbersome species that required various sustenance in order to live."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is fine. Rest. During this time, you can eat or even sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying so, Twisted Kindness raised her left knee and placed her hand on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not worry. As long as you do not try to leave my view, I will not touch a hair on your body until you fully recover. I vow on my name and the Dragon God's honor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu and the remaining members of the expedition team all furrowed their brows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps feeling their collective gaze, Twisted Kindness tilted her head back in laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm telling you to eat, sleep, and recover and fight me when you're fully prepared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, she raised her hands outward in a shrug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since I came all the way here, why can't I enjoy myself a bit? With some of you looking like you're on your last leg, I won't be able to brag even if I annihilate you all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, this boldness of hers showed her faith in her own abilities. Perhaps it was the graciousness of an expert who could not find her match for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it this way, her action wasn't entirely nonsensical. It was just that—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What will you do? I don't mind fighting you now if that is what you want."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu almost ended up nodding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' offer was without a doubt beneficial to the expedition team. But the reason he hesitated to accept it was because of an indescribable restlessness he was feeling inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who was paying close attention to the current situation, felt a sense of incongruity from her words. Though he could certainly say the enemy was showing kindness… it somehow felt warped and distorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than doing them a favor, it looked like she was aiming for something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'…I don't get it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racking his brain and hesitating, Seol Jihu's eyes suddenly narrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What is it?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He couldn't figure out Twisted Kindness' true intention, if there even was one. But seeing the furtive expectation in her joyous pupils, he made up his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't sure whether this was the right choice. It could very well be that Twisted Kindness was truly giving them a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he had a strong feeling that something would be too late once he accepted Twisted Kindness' offer. This ominous feeling told him— even if they achieved their goal and returned to Tigol Fortress, everything would be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So once he made up his mind, Seol Jihu tightened his grip on the Spear of Purity that was loosely being held in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' eyes lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that they stood little chance…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prepare for battle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu squeezed out his voice and gave the command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition members didn't say anything. Only the sounds of their weapons being raised were heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hoh…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness' eyes curled. She looked surprised, but did not say much and shrugged with a grin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alright then—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing up, she dusted her butt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revealing her teeth in a grin, she beckoned them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment she took a step forward—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fierce gale abruptly blew forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing behind Twisted Kindness like a ghost, Oh Rahee struck down her blood-colored longsword. Concentrating all her energy in this movement, she had acted with a truly monstrous speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what was even more surprising was that Twisted Kindness dodged it simply by slightly tilting her head to the side. Not to mention, she was still looking at the rest of the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longsword that missed its mark returned at an incredible speed, but this time, it was blocked by her arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh Rahee's eyebrows twitched. She was using sword qi, but not even a scratch appeared on Twisted Kindness' arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Haaaaaat!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Oh Rahee did not stop. Judging that a sneak attack was the only answer, she frantically swung her longsword.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her quick sword flashed at a terrifying speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Twisted Kindness was unshakeable. Calmly walking forward, she only moved her arm to parry or block Oh Rahee's flurry of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh Rahee continued to chase Twisted Kindness while attacking her, but her expression slowly loosened in a daze. She couldn't believe what she was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness shooed her away as if to chase away a fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Oh Rahee saw next was a long, thick tail that struck her ribs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Puk!&lt;/em&gt; Along with the sound of her skin bursting, Oh Rahee's body was sent flying to the left like a bullet. Her body, arced like a bow, cut through the air like a ray of light before slamming into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her longsword also spun in the air before helplessly plunging to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uaaaaah!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Valhalla!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The members of the expedition team rushed forward simultaneously. On the other hand, Twisted Kindness walked slowly. The contrast clearly showed the difference between the two sides' power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Twisted Kindness abruptly bent her knees and lowered her center of gravity. Then, the moment she kicked off the ground, Chohong, who was running in the lead, widened her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A powerful gale suddenly blew against her. The moment she went "Ah", Twisted Kindness rushed in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn't punch or crash into Chohong. The wind pressure from Twisted Kindness' charge was all it took to send Chohong flying while screaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that instant, Twisted Kindness' eyes moved in all directions. Before a single second could go by, she spread her arms out like two lightning bolts. Hoshino Urara and Hugo, who were about to strike down with their weapons, couldn't utter a single cry as they were knocked back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threads imbued with holy power flew in swiftly and stealthily using this opening, but Twisted Kindness dodged the attack by raising her leg backward in a huge motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, she hastily moved her tail and snatched an arrow that was about to pierce her temple from the air. Then, she threw it back using the power of only her tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flying back quicker than it initially flew over, the arrow easily pierced through Seo Yuhui's urgently-crafted barrier and pierced Agnes' stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aaaack!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sharp pain erupted. Feeling like her stomach was being ripped out, Agnes squealed while being pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then. While Twisted Kindness' attention was taken, Baek Haeju and Phi Sora rushed in from opposite sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their sharply thrust spear and robustly swung longsword were stopped before they could reach their target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness had turned instantaneously and grabbed their weapons with her hands. Her leg was still raised behind her from the previous motion as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uuuuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much they twisted or pulled on their weapons, they didn't budge as though they were stuck inside a boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness clicked her tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You really must be tired, Sacred Empress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then raised her hands in an instant. Baek Haeju and Phi Sora were pulled up alongside their weapons, headbutting each other above Twisted Kindness' head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two then lost their grasp over their weapons and fell to the ground while dripping down blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only then that Twisted Kindness let a breath loose and threw down the weapons in her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she slowly lowered her outstretched arms with her leg still raised back like a figure skater, she looked beautiful and gracious like a goddess of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu froze up following his instincts and dumbfoundedly gazed at Twisted Kindness lowering her leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't have any other choice. Having achieved some level of success in techniques and combat experience, he knew how amazing and mindblowing her movements were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He couldn't see a single superfluous movement. She had fought off several people using only the movements she needed. To Seol Jihu, it was like seeing water of 100 percent clarity, devoid of any impurity and filth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How about it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness gave an alluring smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was that enough to demonstrate the clear difference in our abilities?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I will admit that you have just gone through a fierce battle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted Kindness nodded her head and spoke in a soft voice that didn't suit her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to rest, you can. I will wait patiently. For the record, your comrades are all alive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was saying she didn't kill them on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's face contorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reason was telling him to accept this offer, but his instincts were fiercely rejecting it. Moreover, her pupils had been getting on his nerves since a while ago. Her gaze was filled with a furtive expectation, despite being able to kill him at a moment's notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was as if there was something she wanted to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, an inexplicable repulsion rose up from the bottom of his heart, and Seol Jihu clenched his teeth hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he lit up his fighting spirit, the gentle smile on Twisted Kindness' face became thicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ahahaha. I see. I thought it was the perfect situation to make it work, but it seems that changing the course isn't so easy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After muttering words that were hard to understand…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She lowered her stance again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thus…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If that is the path your constellation insists on taking—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curtains were raised…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prove to me that you have what it takes!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…To the third of the four most brutal and desperate battles of Seol Jihu's life in Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-326"&gt;

Immediate Battle (5)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-326</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As the green energy began to seep into the Unicorn's outer skin, Seol Jihu pushed his spear in deeper while rousing the power of Soma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking that this was the end, he exerted the anti-evil energy to the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, as golden arcs of lightning crackled on the overflowing holy water—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PZZZZZZT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"KIAAAAA!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's mouth split open. Inside a blindingly dazzling burst of light, it shook and thrashed its body in a frantic struggle, screaming at the top of its voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not a single thing went its way. Threads imbued with holy power newly flew in and bound the Unicorn's forelegs again. As a result, the Unicorn became frozen in place with its forelegs and hind legs spread wide, and the lightning current frolicked around in the green sea like an excited child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kuooooo….! Kuaaaa….!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's squirming died down just as quickly as its screams. Its previously grinning eyes rolled back as it clearly looked to be on the verge of losing its consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Seol Jihu did not drop his guard. His comrades had exhausted their power to create this single opportunity for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The golden light surging around him already demonstrated that he was using the anti-evil lightning to the fullest, and he had no plans to pull his punches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, just as he was about to scrape up every ounce of mana in his body, risking potential damage to his mana circuit, Seol Jihu suddenly received a strange sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It's being pulled in?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lightning current that was running around like a playful child abruptly became orderly. Then, it suddenly stopped dancing and was sucked in one direction like a child answering its mother's call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken aback by this sudden phenomenon, Seol Jihu cast an upward glance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack wasn't over yet. The holy water's aura shot up like a fountain and began to take shape. It split into twenty-six streams, spread out like a discus, and slowly rolled up from opposite ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final shape was that of a flower. The twenty-six streams of holy water came together and bloomed into a lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, as it absorbed the lightning current that was flowing in, a truly wondrous golden lotus flower bloomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boom!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one petal exploded in a terrifying flash of light—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kurarararararara!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn that was nearing its death once again rampaged in madness. It shook its head in all directions, reeling from pain as the lotus flower exploded inside its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the petals continued to explode one by one, raising a storm with extraordinary explosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, Seol Jihu narrowed his eyes. The light from the explosions was so intense that it was dyeing his vision white. Due to its fierce intensity, Seol Jihu worried he might lose his sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the threads imbued with holy power were about to melt like wax under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glancing to the side, Seol Jihu saw Baek Haeju glaring fiercely with her hands pressed together. She was in deep concentration, sweating profusely with her mouth firmly shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu also clenched his teeth and gripped the Spear of Purity. Once the twenty-six petals of the lotus flower all bloomed, the periodic explosions halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterward, the swaying horse head stood erect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keeeeeeeeu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With heavy pants, Raging Temperance's eyes lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju quickly shouted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get back!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, the six Warriors who rushed in, including Baek Haeju and Seol Jihu, fell back simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Unicorn raised its forelegs and began to stomp down crazily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boom, boom, boom, boom!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after taking dozens of steps backward, intense vibrations could be felt under their feet. Although the Unicorn was attacking blindly without a clear target, it was still incredibly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He still has so much energy…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Chohong sighed with an exhausted look, Baek Haeju shook her head in denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A candle burns the brightest right before going out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing the calmness in her voice, everyone gazed at Raging Temperance. After finishing its short final struggle, the Unicorn was left in a sorry state that was hard to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its bulky body had cracked up and was now looking grotesque like a deflated balloon. Its beautiful white hair had burned to a crisp, exposing a barren hill, and the way parts of its body were stained black, pus mixed with blood must have flowed out before being cooked by the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uwuk, uwuk, kuwuk, kuwuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It even started to dry-heave while dragging its four legs. It was easy to see that it wasn't in the best condition. The expedition team's killer move had done its job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, as if to prove this conjecture, the Unicorn's legs buckled and it plopped down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chohong's complexion brightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is it dead?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aaaaaaaah! Shut up! Take what you said back right now!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoshino Urara threw a fit as soon as Chohong asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't you dare plant such a shitty death flag!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Come on, if you say something like that, this bastard is gonna come back to life, saying something like, 'Uhahaha! Not bad for a bunch of humans! I will show you my true power now!' Don't you watch movies!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, everyone shut up. They knew she was joking, but a part of them couldn't help agreeing with Hoshino Urara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…There's no way he's dead yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju sighed while watching the vomiting Unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each Parasite Army Commander was bestowed with the power of a god and cannot be looked down on. Even if we get lucky and force them to the verge of death, they can always use Divine Manifestation as a last resort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh right!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugo did a double-take and asked in fright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"T-Then shouldn't we hurry and finish it off? Before he uses that Divine Manifestation thing…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Baek Haeju shook her head once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each Army Commander had a different degree of success in absorbing the divinity they were given. The more they failed to digest, the bigger the surge of power is when they release it. We have to be wary of being swept away by this terrifying storm. I can't remember how many Earthlings died like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, the vomiting Unicorn flinched. The way its burned, scar-filled face contorted, it must have been planning on doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You… you… you cowardly little bitch!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tried to stagger up, but ultimately fell back down. Hugo shouted again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then what do we do!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just wait. For now, save every last breath you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju spoke firmly as if she couldn't be bothered to explain more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just so happened that Seol Jihu expended his full power in the previous attack. He didn't mind taking a short break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling like the inside of his body was completely empty, he quickly collected his breath. Soon, a voice rang out in his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—As you can see, it's almost over. All we need to do is force Raging Temperance to release its divinity and then escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone's gaze fell on Baek Haeju at her unexpected words. Hugo was about to insensitively inquire, but Oh Rahee quickly kicked his shin and shut him up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—The Army Commanders don't have their divinities sealed for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Each individual of each race has a clear limit as a vessel. In the first place, it is extremely difficult and rare for a mortal to fully absorb the power of an immortal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Baek Haeju said, an Army Commander did not release their divinity unless it was absolutely necessary. Although each Army Commander was different, they could only last ten to thirty minutes once they used Divine Manifestation. Once that time passed, they would need anywhere from several months to a whole year to replenish their strength and recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, Divine Manifestation was an extremely inefficient skill that was only used as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—But once they fully release their divinity, their strength will truly be on par with a god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Without an expedition team full of Level 7s or a defensive measure rivaling Tigol Fortress at its prime, facing an Army Commander in that state is no different than suicide. Instead, we have to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—But this also means that we only have to wait out this time. Moreover, releasing divinity in a healthy state is totally different from releasing divinity with such injuries. In the latter case, they won't be able to sustain the divinity for as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Plus, given that Raging Temperance has the word 'raging' in its name, there's a good chance that it will lose its mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu nodded. Baek Haeju was saying they should wait until the Unicorn released its divinity before scattering and running away, then coming back to finish it off once it ran out of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the enemy might curse them for being cowardly, there couldn't be a better method for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Philip Muller's Teleport around, their victory was practically guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Unicorn might, in a fit of rage, choose one or two targets to chase down, but Seol Jihu shook off this worry. He wasn't in any position to be nitpicking every possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu looked at Baek Haeju, who was calmly taking in deep breaths. He couldn't hide his surprise. It wasn't a lie that she had the most experience out of any Earthlings. The tide of battle had turned with a single attack, just like she planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurately identifying the enemy's weakness in such a short exchange and giving an effective solution. Admiring this ability of hers, Seol Jihu steeled his resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Let's just do whatever Miss Baek Haeju says.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuu…. Keuuuu….!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn glared at the expedition team while panting heavily. It should have released its divinity by this point, but it must be hesitating because it realized Baek Haeju's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only scratched the poor, blameless earth with its foreleg, stalling for time. Seeing this—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Even if it's dangerous to get near him, it should be fine to attack him from afar, no?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcel Ghionea aimed his crossbow. &lt;em&gt;Drrrk.&lt;/em&gt; Once he shot his bolts, the remaining members joined in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having recovered a small amount of mana, Seol Jihu formed several Mana Spears and threw them as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knew such attacks wouldn't be enough to bring it down. It was only a show to force it to hurry up and release its divinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks must still be threatening due to the gravity of its injuries as the Unicorn hurriedly stepped back. However, it fell back down a moment later and was forced to curl its body like a bullied kid trying to protect himself from rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before anyone noticed, its body had gotten smaller. It was in a pitiful state compared to how proud it was initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Come on! Hurry up and release your divinity!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know you have to! Let's see what you're made of!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition team began to mock the Unicorn as they continually sent one mana-infused attack after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heeeeu, heeeeeu! How can I… how can I…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the helplessly cowering Unicorn raised its head. Gritting its teeth loudly, a bitter hesitation flashed on its face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thwack!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after being hit by Seol Jihu's Mana Spear, it could no longer bear it and finally spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"D-Dammmnn it! H… Help me!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu doubted his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did it just say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"W-Why are you just watching!? Didn't you say the Queen personally ordered you to come!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…How embarrassing!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quiet, silvery voice resounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who was about to throw another Mana Spear, unwittingly paused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't the only one. Each member of the expedition team stopped moving and froze like statues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just because they heard a mysterious voice out of nowhere. It was more so because of a frightening presence that suddenly swallowed the area wholly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was half doubtful, but alas, the Queen's worry was not unfounded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu looked up in a daze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A figure with twin horns on its head and a long tail stretching out from its butt was floating in the air and proudly looking down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be more precise, it was glaring at the Unicorn, not the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Since when?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu couldn't detect it at all. This also meant no one else noticed this existence, not even Baek Haeju.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who was the one who told me not to butt in? Didn't you say you would take care of them alone?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"T-That's…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the reptilian pupils of its bright, yellow eyes slit vertically, the Unicorn furtively lowered its gaze and turned its head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hah, I thought you were a fool who only knew how to be arrogant. Now that your life is in danger, you're quick to sell off the little bit of pride you have left. What an embarrassment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing the stern rebuke, the Unicorn's face contorted with shame and humiliation. Its frustration was easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly-emerged existence snorted, then pushed up its ivory-colored hair that flowed down like a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the expedition team was in a state of confusion. No one could open their mouths because of the strange goosebumps they were getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This being's presence was bigger than that of any other existence they had met. They could even feel a boundless, inestimable aura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This immense power was a cut above even Roselle La Grazia and Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last, as their eyes met…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Run!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju, who had maintained her cool until now, surprisingly yelled out loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, she launched herself like a flying tiger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensing an abnormal flow of air, Seol Jihu flinched. At the same time that a cool breeze blew past his neck, someone reached toward Seol Jihu from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ak—!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He let out a yelp in the next moment. Looking back reflexively, he saw Baek Haeju with her arm raised. Her hand was in the shape of a blade as though she was planning to strike down on his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was that she was standing stiff and doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was trembling faintly in an awkward position as if something was binding her and preventing her from moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Knocking him out and escaping with him against his will… I applaud your quick-thinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Seol Jihu could figure out what happened, the figure in the air continued speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But since I've received an order, I can't just let him go. Now that you've come all the way here, you'll have to stay for a little bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure clenched its open palm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kyaaeeu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju's grunt became louder. Her arms and the rest of her body began to slowly shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once she barely managed to shake her arm with a heavy frown, the Tathagata Spear spun while emitting a green light. That must have freed her as she spat out the breath she had been holding in. However, the grimace on her face did not disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oho, as expected of someone whose name is well-known to even the Army Commanders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence in the air looked slightly surprised. It retracted the hand it was reaching out with and dusted it off. Its expression was that of amusement and praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…No way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Philip Muller, who was staring with a stunned face, finally opened his mouth. His doubt seemed to become reality after seeing the existence using only one hand to toy with Baek Haeju.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No way, no way…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His voice quivered out as he failed to even form a proper sentence. He seemed to be rejecting reality or at least praying it was false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a silence that seemed to last for eternity, Philip Muller spat out the words in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Seventh… Army Commander… Twisted… Kindness…."&lt;span id="footnote-ref-98d9"&gt;&lt;a href="#footnote-98d9"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he stammered, the absolute silence in the surroundings helped his words get heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complexions of the expedition team members turned pale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not much was known about the Seventh Army Commander, they had certainly heard some things about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the last Dragon remaining in Paradise, the only Army Commander to have fully absorbed her divinity, and the only Army Commander that did not lead an army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing in front of her presence, they now realized that rumors about her were not exaggerated in any way. Their initial reaction to her description was a nonchalant, 'I can see that being a thing.' But now, they fully sensed how absurdly powerful this existence was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same for Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though they considered a second Army Commander being in the Spirit Realm, now that he was facing Twisted Kindness face to face, an indescribable sense of despair swept through his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going through great difficulties to find the spring and breaking through the Astral World to arrive at the Spirit Realm, they had expended a great amount of effort and were on the cusp of neutralizing Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the light of hope that was in their grasp had suddenly flickered off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, let's see. Which one of you is…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it was all because of the appearance of Twisted Kindness, the strongest of the seven Commanders, who even the First Army Commander, Undying Diligence, was said to be helpless against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id="footnote-98d9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. So it turns out Twisted Kindness is female (not male, as I previously thought). I will be making that change going forward. &lt;a href="#footnote-ref-98d9"&gt;&lt;i class="far fa-hand-point-left"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-325"&gt;

Immediate Battle (4)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-325</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoooong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deafening sound rang in his ears. It was a noise that Seol Jihu had never heard before in his life and something that was hard to describe with words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its effect was immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's four limbs were twisted all of a sudden, causing it to collapse on the ground. Raging Temperance finally showed signs of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuh…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It let out a short groan while its body lightly swayed. It looked as if it was being subjected to a tremendous amount of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euhhh!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, a third of the flock of Nightshades that it had previously released could be seen being absorbed back into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance managed to steady himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heheh… Heheheh…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It let out a suppressed laugh while sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was wondering what you were up to… but it was only a curse of the Seven Sins?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You expended so much effort to manifest yourself here… yet you only managed to limit my abilities?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avaritia did not reply. She only sent a mocking glare towards it, cold enough to make everyone in the area feel its chill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Truly laughable, Avaritia!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the Unicorn laughed with great arrogance, anyone could see that it was forced laughter to mask its bluff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Raging Temperance himself was telling them that the curse was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmph. It doesn't matter. Even if I can't do anything about the Authority, I can just recover the divinity I've lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that, another third of the Nightshades around the Unicorn were absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Good. The movement speed of that perverted Unicorn should have significantly dropped now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu could hear Baek Haeju's mental transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His eyes widened when he found out the nature of the curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one reason that the Fourth Army Commander could toy with their expedition team after their first clash, and that was its other-worldly movement speed that could not be followed by human senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a limit was now placed on its mind-blowing speed. In other words, the power of the Fourth Army Commander was greatly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, while it might still have abilities that it had yet to expose, things were undeniably looking better for the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—The Whacko Archer will make an opening for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Whacko Archer?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—When she does, launch a surprise attack with your Spear of Purity. There's no need to injure it. It'll be enough if you can just make it retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued saying things he didn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—The spear you're holding in your hands is an incredible treasure. It might even be a stronger divine weapon than my Tathagata Spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu subconsciously clenched onto his Spear of Purity after glancing at the green spear Baek Haeju was holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—It doesn't look like you can draw out its true power, but I'm sure of it. The Unicorn looked like he was desperately trying to avoid that spear of yours. You should be able to make him retreat with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu nodded his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A moment later, his comrades started to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Archers' started shooting, signaling the start of their plan, the Warriors who had sneakily surrounded the Unicorn charged towards it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tsk tsk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn remained nonchalant, mocking them to try as they would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of retreating, it waited for them to come near before easily sending Chohong, who charged at it while under her Manifestation ability, flying using its horn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Valhalla!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its hind legs, it violently kicked up Hugo, who was aiming for its back, and reared in response to Oh Rahee, who was rushing toward it at a frightening speed. It bent its forelegs in a 90 degrees angle in preparation to stamp her into mush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hup!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Fourth Army Commander reared, a shadow suddenly materialized behind its back. With one arm tightly wrapped around the Unicorn's neck and two legs strapped across its body, it was none other than Hoshino Urara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu finally realized who the Whacko Archer was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hoshino-style Secret Ultimate Move! Ura Charge!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shouting that, she slid the katana she was holding in her left hand down the Unicorn's neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or rather, she tried to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when she was about to stab down, the Unicorn glanced at Hoshino Urara, who was mounted on its back before violently shaking its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eueeeeeeh!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Unicorn desperately began to struggle to shake her off, Hoshino Urara became a flag fluttering in a storm. It was struggling so violently that Oh Rahee couldn't easily approach it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ack!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoshino Urara, who was thrown off in the end, gaped open her mouth. It was because the Unicorn stomped its hoof down on her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unghhhhhk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain of muscles tearing and bones breaking swept over her. No matter how much Hoshino Urara tried to endure it, she couldn't help letting out a suppressed moan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huhu. A perfect ending for an insect like you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eeek! Ehugh! Euk! Ungghhk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just scream, won't you? Hahahaha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn ridiculed her to his heart's content as he watched the greatly distressed woman. However, the Unicorn's face gradually became sour the more Hoshino Urara was in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She definitely was in agony. She was, but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Teh! Tehtik! Tehtititi! Teik!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to her began to disgust the Unicorn. It somehow began to get ticked off looking at her scrunching her face up like a Hahoe mask and letting out strange noises through a puckered mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It almost felt like it was being teased. No, it was sure she was ridiculing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This fucking bitch—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn suddenly grew angered for no reason and raised its forelegs again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll crush that foul mouth of yours!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as it was slamming its legs down…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tehti?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoshino Urara suddenly opened one eye. As soon as she saw the frustrated and pissed-off horse head, she immediately looked towards her left and shouted at the top of her voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do it now! Right now!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The horse head urgently swung to the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was nothing. It couldn't find anything that would pose a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just kidding!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoshino Urara grinned before grabbing her shattered shoulder and rolling away. When the Unicorn saw Hoshino Urara again…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Save me!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…She was already running away after freeing herself from under it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver threads shot towards her from afar as if Agnes were trying to help the injured girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angered Unicorn crouched down. It meant to chase after the insect that gave him humiliation before the fast-approaching threads snatched her from its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was what it tried to do but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn suddenly froze in place, right as it was about to kick off the ground. It suddenly felt a mighty surge of holy fluctuations from its right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it quickly turned its head around, it could see Baek Haeju in a stance, gathering energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It occurred to the Unicorn at that moment that it was forgetting the two beings it should have been wary of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn furiously ground its teeth but still turned to face Baek Haeju before retreating several steps away from her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was why it couldn't see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threads that Agnes had released brushed past Hoshino Urara and were flying straight toward it in the direction it was retreating in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't even aware of the incoming attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was because Raging Temperance's attention was not only on Baek Haeju but also on Seol Jihu, who launched a surprise attack according to Baek Haeju's mental transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You treacherous bastards!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn grit its teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was actually fuming inside because it had been deceived, but on the other hand, it also felt that they were laughable, thinking that their attempted ambush was all they had been aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only, it couldn't ignore the divine spear overflowing with sword qi imbued with the Anti-Evil attribute, so it quickly backed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though its movement speed was restricted under the curse of the Seven Deadly Sins, it wasn't an idiot that would let itself get hit by obvious attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saak!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagonal spear strike narrowly swished past its snout. The Unicorn snorted seeing Seol Jihu's body passing by in front of its eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to launch its counterattack this time, it powerfully struck the ground with its legs. And the moment when its four hooves were firmly planted on the ground…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Spider webs stealthily appeared out of nowhere and tightly bound its limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following that, a wave of sacred light swept down the lines and dyed all the threads in a pale white color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Haat!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agnes flung her hands apart with a loud shout, causing the legs of the Unicorn that was bound unawares, to be forcibly spread apart in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trifling actions!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Unicorn soon became astonished after it tried twisting its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"W-What!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the threads should have burst all at once. However, the situation was completely different from before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few threads were still breaking, but the rate of them being cut down was noticeably slower. The threads maintained their tension while the white light they were dyed with was preventing the threads from breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just how…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn panicked and turned its horse head around before discovering the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Yuhui, the Star of Lust and the apostle of Luxuria, was transmitting holy power to Agnes by placing her hands on her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who had brushed past the Unicorn, suddenly turned around and powerfully kicked the ground. He rushed like a charging tiger at the Unicorn that was helplessly stuck in midair, unable to move an inch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the perfect chance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because he was aware that he couldn't miss this opportunity, his mana circuit started burning a level hotter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euhhh!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He accurately thrust his spear towards Raging Temperance, who was caught in an unexpected situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spear of Purity exploded out with a golden light, far more vivid than ever, and arrived at the Unicorn's long neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that instant!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue sparks erupted out amidst golden arcs of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who thought everything was finally over, had his face grow blank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spear couldn't pierce through its neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be precise, the spear was stopped before it could even touch the Unicorn's neck. Taking a closer look, he could see a bluish film of light covering its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was that barrier that had protected it from Philip Muller's magic once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it wasn't in the shape of a hemisphere like that time, a barrier was definitely covering its body. The Unicorn must have instinctively activated it at the moment it received the unexpected attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrier seemed to be caving in bit by bit, but it looked like it wouldn't be pierced through in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a hard opportunity to come by. To retreat or not to retreat. All sorts of thoughts flashed in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu and the Unicorn exchanged dazed glances for a second before the Unicorn opened its mouth and revealed its protruding teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hah!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dududuk!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threads restraining its right leg were ripped apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Die!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It screamed while striking down its right hoof at Seol Jihu's head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Iyat!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, its blow missed by a hair's breadth just as it was about to crush Seol Jihu's head. It was because a dark smoke suddenly flew towards its leg and caused it to change its trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's it this time…!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn's face scrunched up when it found a female ghost desperately clinging onto its leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Seol Jihu's eyes started to shine. He clenched his teeth and put more strength into driving in the spear with his hands. As he did so, the Spear of Purity began emitting electricity and started to vibrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling the imminent danger, the Unicorn ignored Flone and hastily broke the threads around its left leg. Once freed, it kicked it towards Seol Jihu, who was giving it his all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, instead of the sound of a head bursting, the sound of metal clashing rang out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn focused its eyes on the shield, which was glowing white from having received Seo Yuhui's holy power, that suddenly slipped in from the side out of the blue and blocked the blow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keu—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moan was let out by none other than Phi Sora. She had re-entered the fight after having been knocked unconscious when she received a heavy blow early on before recovering a little, thanks to Maria's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ughhh!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the blood dripping down her nose, Phi Sora managed to raise her long sword. When her blade became wrapped in flames, she slammed it towards the Spear of Purity with all her might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear metallic ring echoed out as sparks flew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pierce through! Please pierce throuugghh!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kang! Kang!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She let out a yell and crazily swung down her long sword multiple times. And because of the added force, the Spear of Purity really did start to advance bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You, you fucking bitch!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appalled Unicorn repeatedly kicked with its leg, but Phi Sora fiercely held onto her shield that was strengthened by holy power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tenaciously resisted the blows and kept swinging her arm while leaning against Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when the flaming sword struck down another time on the Spear of Purity, a blood-red long sword stuck against it at a terrifying speed and stacked on top of the two weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hold your shield properly! You dumb bitch!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh Rahee shouted while pressing her blade down with both hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euaaah!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chohong's Thorn of Steel also struck down on top of the pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Valhalla!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the moment Hugo rushed to them to heavily swing the halberd which he had been carrying on his shoulders…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chung!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jarring noise like that of glass cracking rang in their ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes suddenly widened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beneath the Spear of Purity, pinned underneath four other weapons, was a small gap on the blue barrier. It was a very tiny gap, but it was a crack nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu clenched the spear shaft as he gritted his teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His internal circuits were already so hot that they were almost on the verge of melting and his mana was raging inside of him like a storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Seol Jihu scraped up all the energy left in his body and focused everything he had at the spearhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euaaaaaaaaah!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a second later, Seol Jihu could clearly feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrier, which had persistently endured up till now, cracked, and the sensation of what felt like his spear lightly piercing through a solid log was transmitted up his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's mouth gaped open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't his imagination or a hallucination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spear of Purity was sticking out of the Unicorn's body. It had finally broken through the barrier!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu yelled at the top of his voice through his opened mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Baek Haeju-ssi!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same moment, Baek Haeju's figure quickly narrowed the distance between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she calmly stretched out her arm, all the aura that had been flaring out about her, spilled into her spear. When she was done, the aura gathered at the tip of her spear and condensed into a point that was smaller than the fingernail of a baby's pinky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju's Tathagata Spear brushed past all the weapons, squeezed through the gap made by the Spear of Purity, and finally pierced into the body of Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uuuuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the sound of something exploding inside it, the Unicorn's body inflated like a pig. When it swelled until it looked like it was about to explode, a green aura began spilling out of its body like meat juice oozing out of a steak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only then that Baek Haeju replied to Seol Jihu's call for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jihu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, holy water flowed out from her body like river water bursting through a dam, while an overwhelming lightning energy poured out like thunder from Seol Jihu's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two auras began to fuse together as if they were rubbing against each other before they completely harmonized in a perfect union!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-324"&gt;

Immediate Battle (3)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-324</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn reared its forelegs, then slammed them down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOOM!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thunderous roar exploded, striking Seol Jihu's ears. The barren land fissured, and an earthquake occurred. The force of the blow was so powerful that even the fully on-guard Seol Jihu teetered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing happened to the other members of the expedition team. Maria fell on her butt and even the Archers who had an excellent sense of balance staggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before anyone could regain their balance, the Unicorn howled fiercely and kicked off the ground. Sharp haze exploded out from its body as it charged straight at the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terrifying speed of the Unicorn made it difficult to determine whether the things scattering behind it were Nightshades or simple afterimages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spread out!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju shouted uncharacteristically. She then rushed forward and planted her feet on the ground. At the same time, the Unicorn headbutted the Sacred Empress!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kahuk!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju was continuously pushed back, leaving behind a long track and quickly breaking away from the rest of the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she seemed to be holding her ground even as she was being pushed back, Seol Jihu couldn't hide his shock. Baek Haeju lasted a long time even when she was fighting the First Army Commander alone. Yet, this time, she failed to withstand even a single blow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prrrrr!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a snort, the Unicorn changed its course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Should I stop it or dodge it?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a split second of hesitation, Seol Jihu made up his mind. It was because Philip Muller chanted a Teleport spell and moved behind Baek Haeju with the two Priests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had some peace of mind now that the targets he had to protect were away from the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he soon realized that this line of thinking was wrong. There was a reason Baek Haeju shouted at everyone to spread out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If clustered together, the Unicorn's terrifying destructive power could defeat them in one go, so the purpose of spreading out was to scatter its attention as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, the remaining members backed off in all directions and distanced themselves as much as possible. However, the Unicorn's speed surpassed their imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, even with such a frightening charge speed, it was extremely deft in cornering. It instantly caught up to a retreating member and curled its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectating Seol Jihu's jaw dropped. It was because the Unicorn's posture was similar to his own while using Flash Step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Watch out!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shit!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Seol Jihu's warning, Phi Sora, who became the target of the Unicorn's attack, spat out a curse and raised her shield. She had given up on running away, realizing she would never be able to escape from its range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Unicorn bounced up like a spring and rammed Phi Sora with the horn on its forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A white film in front of her collapsed as the horn tore through the barrier like a piece of paper. Continuing onward, it even pierced her shield and simultaneously dug into Phi Sora's chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aaaaaak!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Sora flew into the air, splashing fresh blood, before being knocked down with a great force. She quivered uncontrollably, her eyes turned inside out as though she had lost control of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn lifted its head and howled proudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Miss Phi Sora!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snort was heard again. The Unicorn adjusted its posture as if to say it would finish off one person right here, right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes shot open with a flash. A golden current surged up from the bottom of his feet. Rather than running at the convulsing Phi Sora, Seol Jihu used Flash Thunder and rushed towards the Fourth Army Commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn stopped and glanced at Seol Jihu. Even though he was flying forward like a beam of light, it didn't look all that impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it gave up on Phi Sora and turned its body, it wasn't because it was forced to. Its attitude was more similar to 'let's see what you've got'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rushing in, Seol Jihu thrust his arms forward with all his might. A sword qi radiating golden light shot out of the spear blade cutting through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn stood still until the sword qi was on the brink of piercing through its body. Then, it snorted and moved its four legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's breath stopped. Just as he thought his attack reached the enemy, the Unicorn moved sideways in a fluid motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spear of Purity inevitably pierced through an afterimage. Although Seol Jihu immediately struck sideways with his spear, the Unicorn stepped back just as fluidly as before and dodged the attack once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its movement and speed truly defied the laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then did Seol Jihu realize that his speed was far too inferior when compared to Raging Temperance's even with Flash Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't get cocky."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn furrowed its brows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wouldn't be enough even if you went all out, yet you dare to make a probing attack…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, it sounded like its pride had been severely wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Army Commander must have judged that Seol Jihu was holding back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard you exterminated Undying Diligence. I'm very curious how you managed to kill that bastard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn revealed its teeth in a sinister smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you better hurry up and show your true strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lowered its head, pointing its horn forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Otherwise…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It then flew into the air before descending like a bolt of lightning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if to skewer Seol Jihu to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu gasped inwardly and subconsciously threw his body forward. It would obviously catch up in an instant even if he fell backward, so he had chosen a frontal breakthrough. However—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOOM!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the earth behind him heaving…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Behind!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone's urgent voice rang out in his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu reflexively turned his head back, and upon catching a glimpse, he was shocked speechless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After beating the earth, the Unicorn circled back in an almost fantastical display of cornering and chased after him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu instantly turned his body. He planned to strike with the added power of the rotational force, but the horn burrowed in a step earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Iyaaaa!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an instant, along with the sensation of his belly button being pulled to one side, a scorching pain swept through his side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uaaaaah…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he gathered his senses, his feet were already dozens of centimeters off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone had swiftly picked Seol Jihu up by his shoulder, helping him escape the attack by a narrow margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Whew! That was close—]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who are you, bitch!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flone's eyes widened immediately after she let out a sigh of relief. It was because a furious voice rang out from above her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn had moved above her before she noticed and was now holding its forelegs up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E-Eh?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Flone's startled yelp, Nightshades shot out of the Unicorn's body. Next, it strongly kicked the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOOM!&lt;/em&gt; Along with a balloon-popping sound, Flone was sent flying without being able to utter a single cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noticing that she was a ghost, the Unicorn had made the most effective attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's complexion turned dark as he abruptly found himself flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agnes hurriedly shot a wide net of threads in an attempt to restrict the Unicorn, but it shook off the net with only a light jerk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Die!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, it fiercely charged toward Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then. &lt;em&gt;Kwang!&lt;/em&gt; A heatwave crashed down on the Unicorn. The blaze was large enough to cover the Fourth Army Commander's bulky physique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, Philip Muller shot one spell after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then did Seol Jihu land on the ground. Although he hurriedly picked himself back up, the Unicorn easily broke through the fire net, refusing to give him a moment of rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Army Commander did not seem to be hurt in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On closer inspection, a blue, dome-shaped layer was protecting its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A bunch of insects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a snort, the Unicorn released Nightshades once again. It raised its seething forelegs with the haze. Then, just as it was about to chase the desperately fleeing Seol Jihu and strike down—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suddenly stopped its pursuit and fell backward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterward, dozens of green sword qi swept through the area it was previously standing on like a tidal wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman adorning a fluttering white traditional robe — Baek Haeju — landed in front of Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing, stupid!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as she came down, she yelled angrily, opening lips that were dripping with blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have the least amount of information on him! That's why we planned to probe him out first! Why the heck did you rush in!? You don't know anything!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu looked dazed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a reason for rushing in. It was to attract the Unicorn's attention since it was aiming for Phi Sora, who fell into a groggy state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Seol Jihu wasn't in any mind to give a proper answer. He had exchanged several attacks in this short period of time. No, it was embarrassing to even call it an exchange of attacks. In reality, he was the only one receiving them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it was only the first time they were clashing, he felt like he got through three or four life-or-death hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's… even stronger than Undying Diligence…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's obvious!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju said angrily while keeping her eye on the grinning Unicorn lifting its head proudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That fight against Undying Diligence started with my sneak attack successfully detonating his heart. Your second sneak attack also succeeded and dealt a considerable amount of damage to him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But that guy's different. He was waiting for us fully prepared. Do you think our current situation is in any way comparable to back then?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, Seol Jihu didn't remember much of what happened during the valley war. But remembering Baek Haeju's spear piercing the First Army Commander as he was about to kill him, Seol Jihu nodded in agreement unwittingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, that was indeed the case. He had exchanged a few moves with Undying Diligence before ultimately being knocked down. However, that was only because Undying Diligence was 'going easy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Army Commander had toyed with him with one finger, wanting to see the power of an anti-evil energy user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Fourth Army Commander was different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than going easy or being relaxed, it was using its full power from the start, wanting to thoroughly squash them early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we're here, don't think everyone can make it back alive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju muttered in a cold voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what she meant, Seol Jihu clenched his teeth. She was telling him not to interfere unnecessarily as he did before. Even if Phi Sora would be killed miserably, the rest of the team would profit if they could gather information on Raging Temperance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Unicorn started to show signs of starting round 2, Baek Haeju wiped the blood on her lips and shouted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have no choice now that it's come to this!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Listen to me carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu flinched. Baek Haeju's voice had suddenly resounded in his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Don't react to what I'm saying. Don't show it. Don't reveal anything that might give it away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju seemed to have an ability similar to Mental Transmission, which directly transferred one's thoughts to someone's head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was clearly so that the Fourth Army Commander couldn't eavesdrop on their conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You and I need to take the lead, surround that bastard from all sides, and pummel him to death!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—That monster has a fearsome speed and instantaneous destructive power, but his defense must be subpar, judging by the way he bothers to avoid or block attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just like when we killed Undying Diligence!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Just one. Just one chance is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voice being transmitted to his head carried a slightly different tone than what she was saying out loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the valley war, Baek Haeju had witnessed Seol Jihu awakened by the Future Vision overwhelming the three Army Commanders, not just in sheer power alone but also in wits and guile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was planning to use a similar deceitful strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in reality, Seol Jihu had no memories of himself from back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hah. Do you think I permit any sneak attacks?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raging Temperance had a dumbfounded expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju did a doubletake, then hurriedly lowered her voice in a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then I'll go in first and create an opening. Wait for that moment, got it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she was whispering, anyone would be able to hear her if they strained their ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Other people will create an opening. You and I can't miss that chance. Do you remember how we pincered Undying Diligence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, what she transmitted to his head was completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You lot… No, you were nothing but lowly insects from the first place. Fine. Struggle to your hearts' content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn shook its head. By the looks of it, it was thinking that winning wasn't a problem as long as it didn't let its guard down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems even the Supreme Queen has unfounded worries from time to time. Calling such imbeciles top-ranking experts… Tsk, tsk. I'd rather get this over with and shake my hips."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muttering disappointedly, it scratched the ground. The earth turned hollow around its legs as a cloud of dirt scattered in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It put on an intimidating air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—He's coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baek Haeju stood in position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu nodded silently. Now that he took a look at his surroundings, the Warriors who spread out were slowly inching closer to the Unicorn from all sides. They each had a grave expression on their face as if they were willing to become a meatshield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—When he charges at one of us, don't force yourself to make a move. The Star of Avarice will start first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu questioned her message. He was expecting the Warriors to charge in, but the Magician was starting the fight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—He used Manifestation immediately after he Teleported. If it wasn't for you charging in on your own, he would have finished it earlier without having to stop in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment Seol Jihu heard these words, he felt a boundless energy simultaneously rising up from the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The avaricious energy spread far and wide, instantly seizing the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This energy…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presence transcending a human being manifested. Not even the powerful Army Commander could look down upon this presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn turned to the side, where a Magician was standing with an opened book in his hand. Philip Muller looked feeble as if a gust of wind would blow him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was sweating so profusely that not only his hair, but also his thick robe was drenched. Small veins had broken out above his eyes' sclera, and his facial muscles were visibly convulsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And above him, a faint silhouette could be seen of a long-haired person, joining their two hands in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unenthused Raging Temperance suddenly gave a look of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hoh, hoh! Is that truly you, Avaritia!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Philip Muller raised his shaky hand and lifted the book to the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Avar—!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting open his already widened eyes even more…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ava—!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spat out the spell he had been suppressing with a huge breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Avaritia!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, two hands of a goddess, physically manifesting above Philip Muller, dropped down and spread their palms toward the Unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-323"&gt;

Immediate Battle (2)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-323</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The expedition team decided on a course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Tree only grew in a specific area of the Spirit Realm. And currently, the five Spirit Kings were being held captive in that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all went well, they would be solving two difficult problems at once. However, even a child would know things wouldn't go so smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Parasites would try to hinder their plans without a doubt, and the key to success was to effectively break through the Parasites' plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu hastened the march just in case, but the expedition team was slowed down as time went on. Not by their will, but by outside intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick, who was leading the expedition team with its hurried steps, suddenly halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…They're already here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick groaned, then sighed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it! We still have ways to go before we get to the center…! That was too quick…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The startled Seol Jihu looked around his surroundings. Now that Little Chick mentioned it, their surroundings were oddly quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so quiet, in fact, that it seemed dreary. Moreover, though he wasn't sure whether he was mistaken, a buzzing ringing reverberated in his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vibration was full of the negative yin energy he felt when the Nightshades were massacring the Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like the enemy is making their move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick muttered as he quickly shot back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the ringing in their ears stopped. Just as the surroundings regained its dead silence—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're coming!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A haze began to flare up around them less than a second later. The haze gradually turned blue and changed into the shape of will o' wisps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't underestimate them. Their numbers are incomparable to that of last time!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Little Chick said, the enemy forces springing up around them were uncountably many. There were so many of them that Seol Jihu thought all the Nightshades in the Spirit Realm gathered here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressured by the sheer number of Nightshades, the expedition team immediately took action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Seol Jihu even gave the command, the team formed a circular defensive formation around the Magician and the two Priests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oooh—!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Audrey Basler screamed. It was because a large number of Nightshades suddenly spawned in the air next to them and rushed toward them simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Audrey Basler was taken aback by the unexpected attack, Philip Muller, who was on high alert, moved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"——. ———. ——. ———."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanting a spell in an instant, he pointed his long oak staff in her direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he opened his closed eyes in a squint…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bullet.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His thick robe fluttered in a huge motion, and a convex barrier appeared in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nightshades that rammed into the barrier were all bounced back before exploding in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't the end. Philip Muller retracted his staff, then immediately opened up his book. The pages automatically flipped like a leaf in a breeze. The book stopped somewhere in the middle, and Philip Muller tilted his chin up and looked up into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Avar・Ava・Avaritia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of spinning magic circles appeared in the air. Soon, the spinning stopped, and the geometric shapes inside the magic circles shone in a pale color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, the few-dozen magic circles all flashed, shooting out various magic spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boom, boom, boom, boom!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As magic spells rained down like a passing shower, the Nightshades cried out in agony. A single man instantly bombarding such a huge group of monsters to death made the expedition members cheer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, given the sheer number of enemies, a good number of lucky Nightshades broke through the explosions. However, these monsters were quickly dispatched by Agnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a fit of rage, she swept the enemies flying in from all directions. As she spread her arms out and opened her palm, silver threads constantly shot out of her fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the released threads coiled around the gaseous Nightshades like spiderwebs and bound them. Then when Agnes flicked her arm fiercely, they were torn into pieces and ceased to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What terrifying power!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's jaw dropped slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I knew they were strong, but this…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu couldn't hide his shock at the fact that Philip Muller and Agnes' true abilities easily massacred such a large army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the other members had similar reactions, but the two members who annihilated the enemy had dissatisfied expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each fight just leaves me with more questions…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller closed his book with a tap and murmured to himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I agree. They're certainly enough to kill young Spirits, but they're nothing compared to the Seven Armies. I almost feel bad comparing the two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agnes seemed to think the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Seol Jihu was no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was nothing wrong with nice and easy battles. The problem was that these battles shouldn't be this easy given the nature of the expedition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The tiny bit of divinity I couldn't digest… a leftover, if you will.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Anyways, it turns out that putting this leftover in the solar plexus has the greatest effect. Because of it, my subordinates were able to grow stronger too.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Undying Diligence, a Commander's army consisted of members of the Commander's race who absorbed remnants of divinity that the Commander failed to digest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a tiny fragment of divinity was still divinity. Since they carried divine power, they should be multiple times stronger than normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Why are they so weak?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Seol Jihu, who could barely take on a single Vampire even with the help of Flone, he had no choice but to agree with Agnes and Philip Muller's opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It's also strange that we're seeing Spirit Creatures when the Commander is a Mythical Beast…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu scratched his head, not knowing what to make out of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't his only worry. A huge number of enemies had suddenly appeared on their marching path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could only mean one thing — the master of the Nightshades had noticed their presence. Otherwise, so many Nightshades couldn't have appeared at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Hugo yelled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu snapped out of his thoughts, and his eyes widened. A strange phenomenon was happening at the place where the Nightshades exploded like fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ones that died earlier on were being sucked away, leaving behind long tails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, he didn't see well because they were in the middle of a battle and only one Nightshade flew off. But this time, with so many of them dying at the same time, the phenomenon was easier to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one other thing that was different this time around. That was that the Nightshades that turned faint from exploding didn't fly far away like the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were gathering in a nearby area, in the air about one meter above the ground. As a terrifying number of hazy figures clumped together, the entire area looked like it was shimmering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Chohong knitted her brows, an arrow cut through the air with a sharp sonic boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling that something was gravely wrong, Kazuki had followed his instinct and shot an arrow at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the arrow passed through the gas, and the spherical clump of gas became thicker while turning blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big frown formed on Kazuki's face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was just as he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gas sphere mutated in a split second. It grew in size as if to take a certain shape—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crackle!&lt;/em&gt; Then, a deep blue blaze flared up, and a figure popped out from the flames. It was a beast-shaped monster resembling a horse with a conical horn on its forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, almost like a white unicorn…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Unicorn?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Seol Jihu's thoughts reached this point, the beast's long muzzle opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see… It was you all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unpleasant voice akin to forcefully scratching a rusty iron rang out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…No, the unpleasant sensation wasn't just because of its voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment this enemy made its appearance, Seol Jihu had felt that something was off. On the surface, it was undoubtedly a beautiful unicorn with a sacred air, but a part of it felt uncomfortably dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its lustrous white hair was like that, and so was its mane, horn, and body. There was something about them that felt dark. It was inexplicably unpleasant, uncomfortable, and nauseously revolting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So predictable, so expected, so obvious. So The Queen's insight is truly incredible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu furrowed his brows. What it just muttered under its breath made it sound like the Parasite Queen knew about the expedition team entering the Spirit Realm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, this bizarre creature that made him all too reluctant to call it a 'Unicorn' had to have been waiting for the expedition team's arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good, very good. I was just getting tired of being stuck in this place while doing nothing but hunting weak runaway Spirits. This is perfect. Let's see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn nodded its head and looked down at the expedition team from the air with a rather arrogant expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hoh. Two Executors and… hmm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its eyes were indifferent even when it saw Baek Haeju. But upon discovering Seo Yuhui, they lit up all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It finished scanning the expedition team before putting on a proud face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuhuhu, this damned body! It's instantly become excited!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu doubted his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just can't understand this race. Females are all the same. Why obsess over pure maidens?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been muttering to itself for a while now. Seol Jihu couldn't understand why it referred to its own body in third-person and called it a 'damned body'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not caring for Seol Jihu's thoughts, the Unicorn flaunted its tongue while giving lecherous glances. The female members of the expedition team, like Seo Yuhui and Phi Sora, shuddered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The horse's eyes slanting up to a crescent shape was weird enough, but when its crude gaze scanned their bodies, chills went down their backs as if there were caterpillars crawling all over them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euuuuu!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing to withstand the unpleasant feeling, Phi Sora rubbed her arms and twisted her body. Seeing this, the Unicorn guffawed as though it was cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You look like a healthy female. Great! I will give you special care and attention, human female."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fucking hell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Sora growled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hell are you saying, you shitty horse!?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oooh, feisty. I love it. Don't worry. I might look like a Horus, but my junior is long and beefy!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn retorted with a grin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look forward to it. Once you taste my thing, you won't be able to escape the pleasure of your stomach bulging out!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Sora's eyes shot open. But before she bellowed in rage, Seol Jihu stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you the Parasites' Fourth Army Commander, Raging Temperance?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an uninvited guest suddenly interfering, the gleeful Unicorn frowned. However, after carefully studying Seol Jihu, it blinked its eyes and exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oho, I see. You are the one that the Queen mentioned…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're the one who summoned the Nightshades?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn didn't answer. Although it showed interest in Seol Jihu for a moment, that was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well… that's enough chitchatting. Let's get down to business now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What business?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes narrowed. He had a feeling that the Unicorn changed the topic on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do I need to explain?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that wasn't the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to break through me, and I have to stop you. The winner takes all. Very simple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as it finished this sentence, the dim, hazy energy around it instantly turned clear. Then, the terrifying pressure that the Unicorn was giving off revealed itself and pressed down on the expedition team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't be scared! This bastard is the leader of a bunch of weaklings. How strong can it be?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Sora shouted in high spirits as if to shake off the pressure. However—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Puhahaha!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn cackled with its head tilted back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Funny. Very funny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revealing its buck teeth in a grin, it glanced at Phi Sora with a pitying gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Truly an idiotic female. Shouting so triumphantly after defeating trash that is only a part of this body… a remnant energy that I… released!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that final word, its voice suddenly vibrated out, causing the expedition members to flinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aura of the Unicorn took a complete turn. It now gave a bone-chilling aura that made their skins tingle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Seol Jihu nervously raised his guard against the Fourth Army Commander that finally revealed its full presence. On the other, he tilted his head curiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'A part of its body? Remnant energy?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recalled the Unicorn's strange words. Though it was hard to pinpoint, it seemed a bit different than the First Army Commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undying Diligence had shared the divinity it couldn't absorb with members of his race and treated them as his subordinates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this Unicorn… how should he put this, rather than forming an army or a battalion of subordinates, it was treating them like 'trash', no different than leftover food that was thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keuhuhuhu. I would have been disappointed if they gave you trouble. This is fantastic!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since you've got such a foul, manly mouth, you must surely have the ability to back it up!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vigorous voice resounded in Seol Jihu's ears repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just the aura that was different. The Unicorn was much bigger than when it first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Hold on.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't mistaken. The Unicorn was standing when it first appeared, but now it had gotten bulkier and was standing on the ground on four legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might not know—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clacking of its hooves resounded loudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Shit!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's brain frantically sent warning signals, causing him to strengthen his grip on the Spear of Purity reflexively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I, with the body of a Mythical Beast, am—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next moment, the Unicorn snorted as its pitch-black pupils flashed blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strongest Spirit Creature of the Spiritual Dimension!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterward, the unicorn tossed its head up as if a rider forcefully pulled on its reins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now then—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it opened its mouth wide and shouted with a thunderous voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will show you the power of a Darkshini!"&lt;span id="footnote-ref-844c"&gt;&lt;a href="#footnote-844c"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id="footnote-844c"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Also known as Amanojaku (in Japanese folklore). It is a type of yokai or oni. &lt;a href="#footnote-ref-844c"&gt;&lt;i class="far fa-hand-point-left"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-322"&gt;

Immediate Battle (1)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-322</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chwing!&lt;/em&gt; A metallic whistle of a sword being drawn rang out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Seol Jihu gave his command, everyone cut off the rope and raised their weapons to prepare for battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I have to investigate a bit more…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't feel right commanding everyone to charge forward out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they didn't have time. The Spirits were very clearly on the verge of death, helpless against the onslaught of the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'If I can save even one of them, I should be able to get information on the current state of the Spirit Realm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking so, Seol Jihu kicked off the ground in full force. He planned to save the Spirits first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over ten people simultaneously making a move, the enemy noticed them instantly. They stopped their massacre and turned to look. Then, when they saw the members of the expedition team that were charging toward them—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Hiiiiiiiick!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They changed their course with a shrill, bone-chilling scream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're coming!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Sora shouted as strange gaseous lifeforms glowing blue closed in on them in an instant like the blowing wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Will o' wisps?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a closer distance, the creatures' blue light was even more distinctive. Blazing like flames from a gas stove, the ghostly lights flew over like tiny comets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Seol Jihu wanted to observe them a bit more—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crackle!&lt;/em&gt; With the scorching fire nearly touching him, Seol Jihu stabbed forward with his tightly gripped spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he immediately paused in hesitation. It would be normal to feel the spear blade penetrating something, but no such sensation was transmitted to his palms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he expected as much since he was stabbing a gaseous lifeform. The reason he paused was because the enemy froze as soon as his spear blade pierced it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Kirrrrrr! Kirrrrr!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to move an inch, the will o' wisp let out a bizarre cry while convulsing painfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On closer inspection, holy energy could be seen flowing out of the evil-exterminating weapon, the Spear of Purity, and disturbing the will o' wisp's insides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Don't tell me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking what if, Seol Jihu immediately roused the anti-evil energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as a golden current violently gushed out of the spear tip, a sound akin to a balloon-popping boom struck his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Kiaaaa…. Kiaaaa….]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue gaseous lifeform exploded, its color dimming in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The will o' wisp seemed to be vanishing just like that, but then it disappeared into the horizon as if it was sucked in by something unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes narrowed, seeing the lifeform disappearing in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What was that?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He couldn't help but think that it was too easy. However, his hesitation didn't last long. Not only was he still in the midst of battle, but another will o' wisp had also flown toward him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu pulled his upper body back and threw his arm up. As the spear blade emitting a golden light vertically swept the will o' wisp, it was split in half and melted down without uttering its death throe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterward, four will o' wisps simultaneously rushed at him from four directions, but the result was no different. When Seol Jihu swung his spear, they exploded with no resistance. It was really a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was surprising was that Seol Jihu wasn't the only one overwhelming the enemy. Chohong and Hugo were also pushing the enemy back, swinging the Thorn of Steel radiating white light and an axe carrying holy energy, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they weren't overwhelming the enemy like Seol Jihu, they were fighting them off with no difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Sora had even run into the midst of the enemy forces and was showing off a sword dance in high spirits. As a sword scattering flames danced freely in all directions, any will o' wisp that was touched by it was quickly devoured by the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With High Rankers and even a Level 4 doing so well, there was no need to say anything about the higher leveled combatants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition team subjugated the enemy forces in an instant, and the battle ended earlier than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's going on? Aren't these guys too weak?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, that was too easy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chohong and Hugo, who had a good exercise, spoke with a laugh as they wiped their sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were rather nervous before the fight, but with such an easy victory in their first battle, they were overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu kept silent as he was about to say something. Subjugating the enemy wasn't a bad thing, and morale was an important aspect of any battle. He kept quiet, not wanting to ruin the festive mood, but it wasn't that he wasn't suspicious of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the others seemed to be thinking the same thing as Agnes, Oh Rahee, and a couple of others were also silently in deep thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nightshades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller calmly spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're Spirit Creatures&lt;span id="footnote-ref-4296"&gt;&lt;a href="#footnote-4296"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that subsist off of yin or negative energy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You mean the guys we just fought?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. There's just one thing…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller trailed off, then smacked his lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something's strange."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I assumed there would be at least one Army Commander in the Spirit Realm. This isn't just a guess. Although the Parasites have seven armies, two of them almost never appeared in the Material Realm, or the Middle World, since very early on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two armies…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Fourth Army Commander, Raging Temperance, and the Seventh Army Commander, Twisted Kindness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These two didn't appear even in the past all-out war when the Parasites conquered Tigol Fortress. Though it isn't as if they're completely shrouded in mystery, they're still the hardest to see Army Commanders among the seven."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu nodded his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So which part is strange?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hear me out. From what we know, Raging Temperance is from the Mythical Beast race, while Twisted Kindness is the last member of the Dragon race."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the Spirit Creatures you just saw are normally from the Spiritual Dimension. They have nothing to do with Mythical Beasts or Dragons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, a race that should have no connection with the invading Army Commanders were in the Spirit Realm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why would that be…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn't so unacceptable given the Parasites' uniqueness as a species, but there were definitely more than one or two suspicious points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Spirit Creatures didn't have physical bodies, it was hard to say they were a part of the Corpse Army, and they couldn't be considered a reproductive species birthed by mother species for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, they had to be the army under the banner of an Army Commander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are the chances that there is another Army Commander here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's Exploding Patience who is also a Spirit Creature, but I heard her army consists entirely of Banshees. I've never heard of her leading an army of Nightshades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Philip Muller explained, Seol Jihu's expression turned complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It really is strange…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it isn't as if I'm out of guesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller suddenly lowered his volume and whispered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though there's no way to be sure, I heard something from the previous Star of Sloth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The previous Star of Sloth?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm talking about the Executor who preceded Taciana Cinzia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Muller continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After becoming an Executor, he fought the Fourth Army Commander once. He barely escaped death and came back. That was when he said that Raging Temperance was a Unicorn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unicorn…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here's the problem. It's true that Unicorns are of the Mythical Beast race, but they still have nothing to do with the Spiritual Dimension."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this moment that Seol Jihu realized Philip Muller's guess and what he was trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're saying the identity of Raging Temperance might have changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That could be it, or there might be something we don't quite understand. We have to be open to all possibilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu bit his lip as something Gabriel told him in the past suddenly crossed his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'A new card…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survival of the fittest. It was a simple concept. If the Parasite Queen found a stronger race, there was nothing holding her back from changing out one of the Commanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, nothing was confirmed yet. They couldn't jump to any conclusions. They would have to see with their own eyes to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know you're talking, but…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the silently-listening Kazuki cut in between them. He raised his finger and pointed to the front. A small group of Spirits that survived the Nightshades' attack was murmuring among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Humans? Aren't they humans?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[No way! How can humans enter this world…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu swallowed his saliva. Each of the Spirits shone in one of the five colors, having a wide variety of appearances ranging from animals to a small girl. They were all small. Frankly, they didn't look all that powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[They defeated those bastards! Maybe they're here to help!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I might believe that if they were Sky Fairies. But humans?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[But it's true they helped! They saved us!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Wait, there's an aura of a Spirit I've never felt before…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging by the way they were talking among themselves, it was obvious that they were young. Still, they should be able to explain the Spirit Realm's current state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Seol Jihu walked forward, the Spirits' gazes all turned toward him. Looking up with unbridled eyes…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Help us!]&lt;br/&gt;[Please help!]&lt;br/&gt;[Save the Kings!]&lt;br/&gt;[Please save our world!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began to chatter in front of his foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Seol Jihu stood in a fluster from the Spirits pulling on his leg, he flinched feeling something poking his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick was standing on his shoulder before he noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let me talk to these younguns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Y-You…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Un. I'm curious about a few things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu thought for a moment before nodding his head. Since Little Chick was also a Spirit, it should have an easier time talking with the Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick jumped down once it received Seol Jihu's permission. As soon as it landed on the ground, the pestering Spirits were all shocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Eh? Who's this?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do you think? I'm a Spirit, just like you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[But I've never seen a Spirit like you…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's obvious. That's the way it should be. It wouldn't make sense if you younguns knew about me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Eeh? This smell… it's the smell of the five elements and even the sealed light and darkness… Just who are you?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quiet! Even your Kings wouldn't dare to talk to me that way! A low-ranked Spirit should talk respectfully when speaking with their elders!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Little Chick raised its voice, the Spirits immediately quit chattering. They must have felt the difference in their leagues as they all looked dejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Anyway, I have a few questions to ask you all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick cleared its throat and spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you haven't realized already, these humans are reinforcements sent by the Sky Fairies to save our world. Meaning, we are allies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, the Spirits' complexions brightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we just got here, so we know nothing about the details. Every second of every minute counts. Answer to the best of your abilities, got it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[U-Un!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good. First— where are the Spirit Kings?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[….]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can feel them, but it's too faint. Just what the hell happened for the Spirit Realm to turn out like this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…They were captured.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Spirit retorted in a dejected voice, Little Chick furrowed its brows instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Captured? Ifrit, Aqua, Terra, Ea, and Sylphid. All five were captured?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Uun. The enemy they were fighting was too scary…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sobs were heard from the small Spirits. Little Chick let out a dumbfounded laugh, then gritted its teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it, then what about the two Spirit Lords?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm talking about Ophinü Odor and Diffidem Odor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[We… don't know. We were told we can't unseal them so recklessly…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Idiots!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick burst out before the Spirit finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those shit-for-brain bastards! Even in such a situation…!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its short hair stood on ends as it shook furiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After muttering with a heavy pant, Little Chick turned its head and looked up at Seol Jihu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation is worse than we expected. If it's okay with you, I'd like the team to prioritize rescuing the Spirit Kings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescuing the Spirit Kings. There was no problem doing it if it would help with saving the Spirit Realm, but Seol Jihu asked regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are they alive?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can feel them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick clicked its tongue and spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spirits are mortal existences, but they don't return to nothingness after death. Instead, they return to the World Tree and reincarnate. You can think of it as an eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the World Tree is—"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dead. Since this cycle is broken, Spirits should disappear when they die. That should be the case, but…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick paused before sighing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Spirit Kings that were captured long ago aren't dead yet. It's also strange that they're all in the same place. I have a bad feeling about this. If left alone, I'm afraid…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick trailed off, but Seol Jihu understood what it was trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Well… I don't see why not.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also had a feeling that something terrible would happen if the Spirit Kings were left in the enemy's hands. On the other hand, rescuing them quickly and receiving their help seemed to be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As kings of a world, the Spirit Kings should be helpful in fighting the Commanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alright. Do you know where they are?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do. It's where the World Tree is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu's eyes lit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's go. There's no need to delay then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Let's go together!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[We'll help too!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing Seol Jihu's reply to Little Chick, the young Spirits eagerly spoke. However, Little Chick snorted and refused adamantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't be ridiculous. You twerps can't even handle a single Spirit Creature…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Still!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Listen to me. I'm not telling you to just sit here and do nothing. I'm sure you have your circumstances, but you must have been traveling to save the Spirit Kings because you were pushed to a corner and didn't have any other choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spirits nodded carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Tsk, if the lowest-rank and low-rank Spirits are doing this, it's easy to see what happened to the higher-ranked guys."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick spoke regretfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dragging this out will only put the enemies in a more advantageous position. It's a do or die situation now. You guys spread out and gather everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Gather everyone?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There must be other remnant groups in hiding. Bring them with you to the fight. At the very least, you can act as our shields. Even if you die, you'll come back to life once the World Tree revives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You can resurrect World Tree-nim!?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have time to sit around and explain. Just do as I say. This is a pressing matter. The longer you guys take, the smaller the chances get of us saving the Spirit Kings. Got that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little Chick emphasized the urgency of the matter multiple times, and the Spirits finally looked convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Got it! Then we'll meet up at the World Tree?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[We'll hurry and bring as many Spirits as we can!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't be strange for them to ask for protection since they could be ambushed again. Seol Jihu couldn't help but feel a little proud seeing the little guys courageously scattering in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'…No.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this was only natural. Unable to see any hope for the future, they were charging forward with their lives on the line out of pure desperation. Since a lifeline was suddenly thrown at them from the sky, it made sense for them to grab onto it with all their might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'If only Earthlings were half as courageous and resolute as them…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu chuckled before shaking the thought off his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll take the lead, partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition team began to march with Little Chick at the head. Seol Jihu fell silent, walking quietly while being wary of his surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Little Chick said the Spirit Kings are around the World Tree?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant he could potentially achieve his two goals simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'If all goes well…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition they expected to be greatly difficult might just end easily. Just like how their first battle ended with an easy victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, he wasn't all that optimistic. It would be great if everything went smoothly like a sailboat following a fair wind, but the Parasites weren't fools that could be looked down on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I doubt they'd stay still…'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as he thought that—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I have a theory I've kept to myself.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I haven't said it until now because it was all a conjecture.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu remembered the words Ian spoke before he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Seol. Right now, the Parasite Queen, for whatever reason, is being greedy.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The reason she's left humanity alone as much as possible.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The reason she suddenly abandoned Tigol Fortress and attacked Haramark.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The reason two of the Seven Armies aren't in the Material Realm.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulling over each word he heard back then, Seol Jihu unknowingly bit his lower lip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[If we think hard and connect these together, I believe we'll be able to arrive at the answer— at the key to defeating the Parasites.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Don't try to understand everything now. If it's you, you'll be able to understand what I mean one day. So for now, just remember what I told you. So…!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[So… run!]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'…Master Ian.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His heart became heavy as he recalled the warm, genial old Magician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, he still wasn't sure what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Then I will answer you. As everyone's representative—]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knew one thing for certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Yes.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[It certainly is worth it to protect a Star that even the Parasite Queen fears.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Right. There must be a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reason that Ian told him to abandon everyone and escape alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div id="footnote-4296"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

Simultaneous Outbreak of War (2)</title><link>https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-321</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Tigol Fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a mighty stronghold built at a vantage point in the Hiral Mountain Range with mountains on all four sides. Established on a rugged terrain several hundred meters above sea level, it truly was a fortress blessed with natural defensive barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did its geographical placement make it a reliable base for defending the road that led to the heart of the Federation, but it also served as a strategic location for protecting the border between the Federation and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing the importance of this location early on, the chief of the Fallen Angels, Gabriel, integrated her knowledge from another world with the dwarves' excellent craftsmanship and the Spirits of the Sky Fairies to build the walls of the fortress through blood and sweat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as it was called the last bastion of the Federation, most people felt the same feeling when first standing in front of the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone that entered through its magnificent entranceway, which stood like an impregnable gate at the bottom of the cliff, and slowly walked up to the top would be able to see giant statues holding sharpened spears and swords carved into the sides of the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they arrived at the end, they would be confronted with the fortress rampart which stretched along the terrain as far as the eye could see like an endless highway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once there, most people would fall into terror at the majestic and fear-striking sight of the upright fortress towering over them on a highland with flowing clouds, just like that of a painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one actually tried looking up from below the fortress, the person would be exhausted from just following up the cliff with their eyes, feeling it firsthand for themselves what 'impregnable' truly meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it was inevitable for amazing things to become familiar and new things to become worn-out. Such was the natural order of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mountains that surrounded Tigol Fortress used to boast a dark green color full of vitality, but now everything was dyed crimson on a background of gray, making them look ominous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dark red stains that persisted on them through many years were evidence of just how long a violent war had been taking place in this location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same for Tigol Fortress itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were so many scars of war on the fortress that it was shameful for it to have once been called the 'Tomb of the Corpse Army'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't only because of the long war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any rate, it was a stronghold that had fallen once. The Federation managed to succeed in recapturing it in the end, but there was no way that the Parasites obediently retreated after their loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Parasites enacted all kinds of brutal and wicked atrocities on the fortress, causing it to lose its once hoary color. And with it, its longstanding prestige was extinguished, just like the shriveled up dead tree at the center of the stronghold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Federation had restored the fortress to a certain extent after reclaiming it, but the fixes were only superficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how imposing its exterior looked, as long as the World Tree remained dead, the fact that the fortress was only a hollow shell of its former self was something that both the Federation and the Parasites knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was because of this that a negative atmosphere was flowing within the stronghold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unknown whether the anxiety within the fortress had an effect or not, but even the sky above it was blotted with dark clouds. Thanks to that, the weather couldn't get any more depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sky Fairies were aiming their notched bows forward, every single one of them with wide eyes filled with fear that couldn't be described with words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cave Fairies that were cursed by the Elemental Spirits all had their eyes covered with cloth, but it went without saying that they too, were taut with anxiety, evident from how tightly they were gripping their weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all. The Dwarves were hard at work, making Thunders even at this very moment while the Beastmen had their claws raised and their fangs bared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the Federation's forces, including its elite troops, were gathered on the fortress in an attempt to defend it. This was undoubtedly a grand spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there was an impossible-to-hide terror hanging in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had no choice but to be afraid. There was an absolutely overwhelming sight unfolding before them beyond the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a terrifying sight that easily dwarfed the majestic presence of Tigol Fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corpse Armies, reproductive species, mother species, the Five Armies… and the figure of the Parasite Queen relaxed on her throne, reigning over the entire sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen flickering with static signals made it apparent that it was only a projection of her, but just the appearance of the enemy leader subjected the Federation to tremendous pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel, the chief of the Fallen Angels, looked up at the Parasite Queen, who was haughtily staring down at the fortress from the sky, and sighed quietly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their morale had already hit rock-bottom as it was. With the projection of the Parasite Queen, who was caged on her Corrupted Throne, appearing before them, there was no more need to talk about their state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, they could feel a strong will transmitted from the enemy— the will of the Parasite Queen to surely bring down Tigol Fortress again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She knew that she had to encourage her allies, but no words came out. They were faced with a war where defeat was as inevitable as fire, so she had no idea how to boost their morale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel stayed silent for a while before slightly raising her head and asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do we know anything about humanity's movements?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her question finally broke the long silence, but there was no reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel let out a deep sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know our communications have been cut because of the signal jamming. I'm asking about our most recent contact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About that…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Fallen Angel, who stood near her opened his mouth to say something with difficulty but mumbled his words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel gave a tired smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did they say they won't help us since it wasn't their problem?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've received news that a draft call was made in five kingdoms, but…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fallen Angel trailed off his words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn't need to hear any further to infer that any further communications had been cut since Parasites arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A draft call, huh."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel's response was lukewarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was because she knew there was a very, very big difference between news of a draft call being made and the news of reinforcements being sent their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was a possibility that the royal families really did send their armies, but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'They won't be enough.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would be of some help against the Corpse Army, but the real help that the Federation needed was from the Earthlings. But whether the Earthlings that were practically without any order would obediently heed the draft call… Frankly speaking, Gabriel was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the problem was that even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the Earthlings came, their chances of victory were still unknown. The Parasite Queen seemed hellbent on conquering their fortress as it looked like she practically brought her entire force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only solace was that Twisted Kindness, who was known to be unrivaled in one-on-one battles, was nowhere to be seen, but this didn't comfort her at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how she looked at the situation, there was no hope, only despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel muttered to herself while in deep distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be nice if the Executors came…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be better if you don't place your hopes on them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel heard a husky voice that was mixed with a growl at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sturdy and muscular Beastman with a mane flowing from the lines on his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our home was taken over, those bastards only looked at us like they were looking at a blazing fire from across the river. Those bastards did nothing when the Executor who was coming to our aid with a small number of people was ambushed and killed. What are you expecting from these shameless bastards?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well. I know how you feel about humanity as the King ruling over an entire race, but…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel let out a sigh. It was already her third time sighing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what your story with them is, we can't help but hope they will answer our call. We're in a situation where every extra hand is vital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ridiculous. You've always emphasized rationality before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Still. Who knows?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel looked at that shriveled up tree before faintly laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That World Tree over there in a sorry state might just suddenly spring back to life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Funny. Did you finally go crazy now that the enemy is right in front of us?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beastman snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Didn't you believe that you should do your best in what you can instead of meaninglessly clinging to impossible tasks?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's because a human that went and accomplished one of those impossible tasks said he'd personally head out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel retorted without showing any change in expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the Beastman suddenly shut his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Seol Jihu, was it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hero who killed the First Army Commander, the infamous vanguard of the Parasite Queen that struck terror throughout Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weight his name carried was certainly not light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indeed. I've heard quite a bit of how he was a man of great ability, enough to make my ears buzz…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes. The Federation would be receiving an enormous boon if he really manages to revive the World Tree. How about it? Wouldn't you be willing to put down your grudges with the humans and think about becoming allies with them then?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hah. Let's talk about this after we see the results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beastman King snorted at the optimistic 'what if's'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The World Tree's revival… hehe. If he truly manages to accomplish that, then I am willing to change my mind about the humans who accompany that person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't completely turn down the suggestion. It was because he knew just how difficult the task was, which was to the point that even the Federation had given up on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was why if Seol Jihu really pulled it off…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right when their words came to a lull, the projection of the Parasite Queen waved her hand in a wide arc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And following that, several hundreds of Nests could be seen settling down on the ground in organized droves and begin bulging their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel's eyebrows subtly knitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nests simultaneously sent their roots down into the ground. It was the sign that signaled the Parasite's attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infestation had begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sure enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…They're coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Corpse Army finally started to take action, just like the Beastman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small dots in the distances gradually became bigger while the surrounding slopes began to be filled with black figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sinister rumbling filled the surrounding air as they approached closer, moment by moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could feel their hair rising as the very ground beneath them began trembling even when they were standing on the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"…Damn it. Is this how it felt? I'm sorry, okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel muttered something incomprehensible before grinding her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though they were in a dilemma of having to defend their base despite needing to quickly go out and get rid of the Nests, they couldn't just sit there and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After barely managing to shake off the oppressive sensation, Gabriel shouted while looking at the dark wave that was sweeping all the mountains in their sight like a tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All units!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she shouted at the top of her voice, the Sky Fairies raised their bows in unison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underneath the arrowheads were stones that let off electric sparks. The Thunder attached to them trembled left and right as they emitted a blue light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fire!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that word, a sharp wind swept through the whole area. A sonic boom was followed by a piercing shriek before a deafening thunderclap shook the entire world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who had thrown himself into the smoke hole, scrunched his face at the sharp pain on his chin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ow ow ow ow…."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment he was about to get up while stroking his chin, he suddenly felt another strong impact on his back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he shouted in pain and looked behind him, he could see Phi Sora, who was treating him as a cushion with her eyes tightly closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she peeked her eyes open, she realized the situation and quickly got off him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I-I'm sorry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, it's fine. More importantly…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking around, he found the members that entered the hole in the second round. It seemed like they had entered as soon as the first team passed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that everyone had landed in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who whimpered as he pushed himself off the ground, suddenly fell in a daze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sky was red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. The entire world was dyed in a blood-red color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to say that his surroundings looked nice, even with empty words. The plants that would have once created beautiful scenery were all withered and bent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a different sensation from the sight he saw at the Delphinion Duchy. If what he saw back then was an already dead world, then this place looked like a dying world. It was just like a gasping patient that was on the verge of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, such things weren't important since they managed to cross over to this place. The important thing now was whether they arrived at the Spirit Realm or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their answer was given to them shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu, who had been dumbfoundedly looking around, fixed his gaze in the direction that Kazuki had pointed. Then, he became utterly speechless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appalling sight was being unfolded in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strange figures numbering in the hundreds, or even thousands, could be seen. They were beings that they've never seen before in their lives, but seeing how they were dyed in a dark shade of one of five colors, it was obvious that they were Spirits at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the majority of these Spirits were dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While appearing to be lesser in numbers, bright blue, haze-like things were slaughtering the Spirits with an overwhelming disparity in strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the Spirits were being extinguished without even being able to escape, and even those that were desperately resisting were surrounded by these hazes and soon scattered into ash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they weren't able to fight back, the number of Spirits, which was initially in the thousands, was quickly falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get ahold of yourself!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu came back to his senses when a stern voice rang in his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got up to his feet and focused as he saw Baek Haeju holding her light green spear in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation was clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fortune amidst all the misfortunes was that the Spirit Realm hadn't completely fallen. The Spirits were still fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it was correct to say that it was a one-sided massacre, but the important thing was that the Spirit Realm hadn't been destroyed yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fact alone was enough for them to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hadn't imagined that they would witness such a sight as soon as they arrived, but that just meant that the situation was that urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, then there was only one thing left to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seol Jihu roughly swung his arm and cut the rope wrapped around his wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stood his ground and tightly grabbed the Spear of Purity before pointing at the strange blue, haze-like creatures that were ruthlessly slaughtering the Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All units."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tigol Fortress and the Spirit Realm…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prepare for battle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fateful battles that would decide the future of Paradise commenced simultaneously at two locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="chapter-nav" href="/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony/scog-chapter-320"&gt;
