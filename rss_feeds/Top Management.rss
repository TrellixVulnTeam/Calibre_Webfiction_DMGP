The sea is freaking deep blue!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can you call it deep blue? So unromantic. It's cobalt blue, cobalt blue!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, just wait until you hit your thirties. Let's see how much you like 'romantic'!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo and Lee Kwanwoo, who were both squeezed in the back seat, whispered to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Kwanwoo, having returned to being a romantic, admired the Mediterranean Sea, taking it all in. Kim Hyunjo was swearing about how he was being crushed as his shoulders were grabbed by Lee Kwanwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stylists and artists' gazes were glued to the opposite windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That guy! Isn't he Kieron Wood?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where? Where? Where?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The one next to the Ferrari!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Which one? There's so many!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look! The one holding the beach towel!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Eh, no, he isn't!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were disappointed for a moment before quickly chattering while looking at another direction. It hadn't been that long since they resolved themselves, saying that they weren't here for leisure but for work and how they couldn't be pushed around by foreign staff. Anyone looking at them now would think they were tourists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it was understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The streets were lined with Ferraris, Maseratis, Bentleys, and other luxury cars I didn't know the names of. There were lots of men and women whose looks would give actors a run for their money. Anyone visiting here won't be able to help but look around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There'll probably be quite a few unknown or aspiring actors among them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's project producer said quietly, seeming having heard them admiring their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the famous film directors, production companies, and agencies gather here at this time of year. Around 4,000 top reporters from various countries arrive as well. It's a land of opportunities in many respects. For us as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mumbling project producer looked towards me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, you said it's your first time in Cannes, but how are you so calm? Some might think you're a local."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does it look like that? I'm actually quite excited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer laughed as if he didn't believe me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I was trying to calm my overflowing emotions by counting palm trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boulevard de la Croisette look like an enormous film set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A film set that took an exorbitant amount of money to build. It looked like it would suit a more historical drama than a modern one. Vintage European buildings lined up neatly on the street. There were even magnificent buildings that reminded you of medieval castles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup gawked as he took in the sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are palaces on the street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are all hotels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer made a crooked smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Majestic, Martinez, Carlton. All 5-star hotels. The film festival only provides such accommodations to really high-level individuals, so all the amazing guys are over there. The entrances are packed with paparazzi and spectators. They'll spend all day to get a glance of a celebrity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rooms there must be crazy expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're expensive, but you can't even rent one even if you have the money at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup glanced at the sedan driving in front of us and the hotels before asking,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you're saying the people in there are receiving the best treatment?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They divide the treatment in there too. Some get suite rooms, while others get regular rooms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll keep them motivated at least."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we were busy looking at the historic hotels, the sedan in front of us came to a stop. While the hotel we stopped at wasn't at the same level as the castles we passed, it still had a grand appearance. The large, white columns supporting the entrance reminded me of a temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Kwanwoo admired the sight as he was taking off his seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This place is really good too though?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since it is provided by the film festival. A night here would probably cost a million won."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup's eyes curved into smiles at the project producer's reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, how wonderful!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though we only have three days, so we'll be chased out the day after tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really didn't have anything in the past. Production companies emptied their pockets to get actors rooms, and the staff rented a small apartment and had multiple members sleeping on each bed. Considering that they provided us with a hotel room, their treatment of us has gotten much better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh-oh, how great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though they only provided them to the actors and director."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Then the staff?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We reserved a residence nearby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer chuckled after manipulating Kim Hyunsup's emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Kwanwoo joined in,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But why did the film festival only provide the rooms for three days?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our official schedule ends by then. However, because the award ceremony is done at the same time as the closing ceremony, we have to wait until then. While holding our breaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then will we only get to see the closing ceremony if we don't win an award?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we don't get an award, we can't go to the closing ceremony. It's an event we can only attend if we're invited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood in the van chilled. The project producer let out a stuffy laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they said to be prepared since Cannes was a society divided into different classes, to think that the treatment was so different. I researched a lot and prepared myself before coming here, but it stung even more now that I was actually experiencing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as the sedan marked with a palm tree leaf, the symbol of the Cannes Film Festival, arrived, a hotel security guard came over. At the same time, the paparazzi and spectators rushed over. I acted quickly because I had experienced similar scenarios back in Korea and China, but it was for naught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectators diligently followed the 'Do not approach' sign of the security guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their gazes as they looked at Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon lit up in interest for a moment before fading away. I had told Lee Songha to keep her sunglasses on just in case, but it seemed that wasn't needed either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard English occasionally mixed in with the French words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I don't know who they are. I don't know which country they are from and what they are doing here. I don't know whether they are actors or from production companies. I don't know, I don't know.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I even heard a paparazzi complain about why nobodies were riding in the film festival cars and confusing everyone. I made sure to remember his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the film festival provided exactly three rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon found out they were the only ones staying here, they said that they would rather stay at the group residence. We managed to push them into the hotel and unpacked in the residence SBE Film had reserved for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, we were on such a tight schedule that we didn't have time to go sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press conference at the Palais des Festivals was just the beginning. Since Director Oh Hyunkyung and Nam Joyoon were weak to the simultaneous translations of French and English, Lee Songha, who was fluent in English, was pretty much dragged to all the conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, she was the number one on the list of Neptune members who shouldn't do interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed I was worried for nothing as it looked like she left a favorable impression on the reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We received quite a few interview requests after the conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production company and distribution company set up a booth in the film market located in the basement of the Palais des Festivals and jumped into making sales. We kept on top of all the interviews. Everyone's faces showed signs of chronic fatigue after working to death for the past two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only one who still seemed too energetic was Lee Songha yet...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, what's after this interview?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another interview."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And after that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An interview."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And after that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another interview."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damn it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her energy was quickly being depleted from the never-ending relay of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we were doing this, articles about the Cannes Film Festival were being published every day back home. There were even articles that considered the actors who went to Cannes as 'national representatives'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City Jungle's official schedule was picked up by the press too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What foreign reporters asked at City Jungle's press conference. Whether the mood was good or not. What people's reactions were like in the film market. They even published details about how much it cost for a night in the hotel Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon were staying at and what their amenities were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the interest back home was growing more heated, the gazes we received here in Cannes was still lukewarm. While we continuously received interview requests, the treatment between us and stars from films nominated for the competition or global stars was as different as heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gap continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more good articles about us before the screening, the better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was lunch. The now pale and thin project producer, who we met at the City Jungle booth, said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rumors are important around here. Worst scenario, the theater will be empty. If that happens, it's like we just came for ourselves and left. Right, there is an even worse scenario than that. Last time I came here, the audience left in the middle where swearing, so the actors were bawling their eyes out. Our rating in Cannes was the worst, so the press was abuzz..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I handed him a glass of water and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have two screenings. One with the press. And an official screening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City Jungle's press conference was 8:30 am tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And its official screening was 11:30 pm tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press screening was too early, and the screening was too late. It was natural for the project producer to be worried about the mood in the theater tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the film is so good, once word gets out after the press screening, the official screening will be smooth sailing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer licked his dry lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's possible. If our film, City Jungle, is able to come through to this crowd."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Isn't it good enough to get our hopes up for? Especially considering it was nominated for best rookie director."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Then, Team Leader Jung, do you also think we have a chance at receiving the award?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chance at receiving the award?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because we were invited to the Cannes Film Festival after I spoke positively on our chances of getting invited to the staff, but there were a few who seemed to be getting their hopes up on receiving an award. I made the same reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, I have my hopes up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I wasn't certain this time as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had recalled the words 'You made a box office hit with your debut movie, a non-mainstream with a noir feel, and won rookie director and screenplay awards. You even attended Cannes.' From my future vision several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't be certain whether they received an award at Cannes or if they received it in Korea then went to Cannes. Even if that wasn't the case, the current City Jungle was different in many parts compared to the version I saw in my vision, so I had no idea how much the present had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite this, I had high hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hoped that the future I change proceeded in a better direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interview tonight was delayed, so we had a short break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we had a lot of stuff to prepare for tomorrow, even though I said 'break', it was only for an hour or two. The Boulevard de la Croisette, which was splendid during the day, was heating up with competition screenings and red-carpet events. It was a festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this made people's hearts heat up and surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stylists and artists went over to luxury brand stores in case there were better dresses here, and Lee Kwanwoo rushed over to the beach to chase a romantic mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I knocked on a hotel door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The door immediately opened. Lee Songha said in a resigned voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another interview?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No. We have one or two hours of free time, so I was thinking we could go out together if you weren't too tired-"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not tired!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The door slammed shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even while she was adjusting to this new environment, she would repeatedly ask me when we would get some free time. I was a little worried when she became dispirited after being rejected eight times. She rushed out, full of energy, thirty minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's go!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is your handbag so stuffed? We only have two hours, so you should leave the guidebook behind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't worry and just believe me! We can spend the two hours like it was twenty!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was worrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving Lee Songha, whose lips were curved so high up I thought they would split, I knocked on the door next to hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon opened the door. At the same time, Lee Songha, who looked like she was dying to brag, barely managed to contain herself and say,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll be out for a while. We have some important business to attend to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's coming with us though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Where?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To attend some important business with us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment I said this, Lee Songha's face turned into a murderer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup pushed Nam Joyoon's back as he came out of his room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't dawdle. Let's go! We don't have time to waste!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha kept glancing at me as we made our way down on the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various emotions, such as sadness and disappointment, flashed across her face as she seemed to be inwardly cursing about how terrible the world was and how nothing went her way. She looked like she was about to say something, but all she did was open and close her lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It's not like an opportunity like this comes every day. I don't know when we'll get an opportunity like this again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read her lips and couldn't help but laugh. Was this a bad habit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time we walked out through the hotel entrance, Lee Songha's face had turned from a murderer's to a slaughterer's. It was to the point where the paparazzi and spectators, who came out to see stars going out to enjoy parties, slowly backed away from Lee Songha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then when we left the hotel vicinity...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then, call me if you run into any problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, let's meet later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup waved their hands as they crossed the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I waved at them as well before continuing to walk down the street. Dazedly following me, Lee Songha's gaze alternated between me and Nam Joyoon. Then she became excited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought we were going out in a group in case we get caught by Korean reporters!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why would there be an issue when a manager and his celebrity are going around together in a foreign country?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the best alibi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No issue. None at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha smiled brightly, revealing her white teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a half-step closer to her and added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's stick closer together just in case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"C-can we? How close?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, I don't know. They say there are a lot of pickpockets around here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then we need to be careful! I saw a warning in the guidebook as well. Let's stick really close together!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha's steps became more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I followed her lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we entered the streets of the city bustling with nightlife and no one to recognize us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 218: Splendid or Shabby (3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chinese? Japanese? Korean? Do you have thoughts on becoming an actor?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She already is one. And she has an agent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times has it been?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bearded agent gave me a dirty look. He seemed to have decided that any further discussion was unnecessary and simply handed Lee Songha his business card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can just discuss details alone...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where are you staying? Please give me your number!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Business card! Then just take my business card at least! Do you know Angela Mayweather? She worked with me in the past! If you want a shot at the red carpet, don't waste your time with that small fish agent over there and call me!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha cut him off and dragged me over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We only had a brief moment of silence after finally managing to brush off that leech-like agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you have any plans tonight? Do you want me to take you to Matt Burkhart's private party?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have invitations to the Last Dance gala screening, do you want to come with me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How about we go on a drive?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought we could strut about with no one paying attention to us, but there was a miscalculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there wasn't anyone who recognized Lee Songha, there were plenty of people who recognized a beauty. In just an hour of going around, I was able to confirm that Lee Songha's beauty was universal. All kinds of flies stuck around. Agents, guys trying to pick up girls, guys trying to pick up girls, and guys trying to pick up girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of damn city was this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like the entire street could be called one big club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man driving a red Lamborghini looked our way and waved. He was a tick that had been following us for a while now. It didn't matter if he was just looking or not, I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed Lee Songha's shoulder and pulled her into a narrow alleyway between two buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's go out after a little break."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't get a reply. Instead, I heard her breathing quicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I glanced down. Because of the narrow space, Lee Songha's eyelashes were looking down at my chin. They would touch if we moved. When I leaned against the broken stone wall, Lee Songha's head followed like a magnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tip of her tongue lightly licked her coral lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Do you have any other place you want to see?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha shoved her guidebook in her handbag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's look around this place. This dark, secluded alley, I think it's nice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you going to see in this dark, secluded alley?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't receive a reply. Lee Songha was staring up at me. Intently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mouth went dry. This time, I licked my lips. Maybe it was because we were in a different country, but the face in front of me looked especially unfamiliar to me. Ah. She had full makeup on for an interview during the day, so her makeup must have run a little while trying to pass through the crowds. Maybe that was why she gave off a more decadent aura, unlike her normal self. This was why all those flies hovered around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't like we could erase her makeup here. Should I get her to wear her sunglasses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was thinking about it, I felt a gaze following me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you looking at?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm sightseeing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha's eyes came up to my nose and curved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, what was full was surging. Like it would fall over at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went into the narrow alleyways rather than the streets. While it wasn't as fancy as the streets, I liked the more leisurely, lively atmosphere. Above all, no flies hovered around us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We stopped at an open-air café.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two coffees and the assorted desserts Lee Songha ordered filled our table. There was an overwhelming smell of butter and chocolate. When I checked my phone, it seemed that Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup were really going all out and sightseeing. They kept posting pictures in our group chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most were pictures they wanted to show Nam Joyoon's parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha stared at those photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I glanced at the corner of the guidebook that stuck out from her handbag and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you want to look around a few more places before we go back to the hotel? Maybe the beach?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thinking about it, I think I've seen a ton of these in California."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, you mentioned you stayed there for a while."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wasn't the type to bring up her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought she would change the subject soon, but Lee Songha continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My aunt and uncle live in California. Our family wasn't in a great situation when I was young, and my aunt said that she would take care of one of us for a few years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you're the only one who went in your family?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My oldest sister wanted to go study abroad, but my aunt and uncle took me instead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said it was because I was the prettiest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I abruptly stopped drinking my coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suddenly recalled Lee Songha's family. And the mood that didn't give you a familial sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha seemed fine after saying such disturbing words as she took a bit of the croissant. Then she looked happy because of how tasty it was. I shoved the questions that were surging up my throat back down. I felt like I would break that peaceful mood if I said anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I simply laughed with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to see the Last Dance screening! We've come all the way to Cannes!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Give up. I bet the line waiting to buy tickets is huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's take a picture with the poster! Take one so Mason Tucker's face shows up really well!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The street of films. I heard tourists taking pictures amongst the posters lined up like trees lining the street. Lee Songha and I looked at a familiar poster amidst the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jungle City.&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the poster meant for the overseas market didn't have Lee Songha or Nam Joyoon's face on it. Only their names were printed at the bottom. Maybe it was because Lee Songha was wearing sunglasses, but it was quiet now that there wasn't anyone intently looking our way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though there was the occasional person who looked with interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jungle City. This is screening tomorrow. Let's go watch this!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not really feeling it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Still, don't you think we'll be able to buy tickets for this one? We need to commemorate coming here by going inside a theater once! We don't know when we'll have another chance!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mason! It's Mason!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Megan!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screams and shouts erupted somewhere. Of course, it wasn't that Mason Tucker and Megan Shannor leisurely arrived at La Croissette. Spectators gathered around an enormous screen on one side of the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a live video of the red-carpet event going on at the Palais des Festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen had been showing the entrances of various VIP and celebrities from different industries, but now the central figures of today, Hollywood top stars, had arrived and were waving their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual place must be so full of spectators and reporters, who arrived early, to the point that there was no room to actually walk, which was why people were probably watching the live feed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People's reactions on screen were heated, and the reactions here were fanatical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What! What! They are shaking hands! They're even giving out autographs!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should have waited for a few hours there!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various languages could be heard from the commotion in front of the screen. Although I could somewhat understand English and Chinese, what they were all talking about was obvious. Half the words were the names of actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen continued to show the leads of Last Dance. The actors, who wore a tuxedo and dress, made cheerful and bold poses on the red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screams of fans asking them to look their way, background music from Last Dance, and the shutter sounds of hundreds of photographers going off simultaneously blasted out the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I calmly stared at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we first received invitations to the film festival, when we arrived at Nice Airport and looked at Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon's hotel rooms, and when we held interviews with foreign reporters. Each time I thought that we were getting closer to that world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a bit excited, thinking that the tips of our toes finally touched it, but that wasn't the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were still so far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I abruptly looked beside me. Lee Songha, who had been chattering on, was quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha had taken her sunglasses off and was staring at the screen while standing rigidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the world overflowing with red carpet, cheers, and camera flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, I want to go there once."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Palais des Festivals filled with people was completely different from when it was empty. It was exactly that. It was a palace of dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glittering lights shined down, and loud sounds felt like they were squeezing my heart. A 30-meter long red carpet flowed down the tall stairs. The actors walking up the stairs grew distant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha stumbled towards the screen before she was pushed by a loud spectator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Songha, are you okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes! Yes, I'm fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She nodded before getting on her tippy toes and stretching her neck up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distant red carpet, the cheering fans, the photographers wearing tuxedos and shooting pictures. She looked at the sight, a blend of all these elements. She had a strange look on her face. It seemed similar to when she was staring at a new snack that she had never eaten before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And something...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at Lee Songha, who was trying to get a good look, before going towards the control line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While everyone related to the film was excited, Lee Songha, the lead, was strangely different. It was to the point where she seemed more interested in the sightseeing than attending the film festival, interviews, or the possibility of receiving an award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, she was like this from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha had a tough time in Neptune due to her relatively weaker talent in singing and dancing, but when she found her talent in acting, she rejoiced and clung onto it. Like someone who found a foundation to stand on. Then she did her best in every drama and film she appeared in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, something felt lukewarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was true even when I compared her to Nam Joyoon and other actors I had encountered. Although I couldn't perfectly describe it, Lee Songha's sights were not set beyond her limit and rather settled in at a lukewarm distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bothered me like a bone in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she seemed a little different right now. She seemed different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I could light a fire in Lee Songha's heart right here...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I handed Lee Songha's actor ID card to the event personnel, who was busy blocking the swarming spectators. I pointed to Lee Songha, whose gaze was fixed at one place, as I said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some business inside. Could we go in for a second? It's not for the red carpet-!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't enter this place with a t-shirt and running shoes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event personnel waved me away in annoyance after glancing at the ID card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This damn dress code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should have gone around in a dress and suit if I knew this would happen. Lee Songha seemed to have heard the event personnel as she turned her head towards me. I clicked my tongue and backed away from the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's endure for a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since she'll be standing on that red carpet tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon wore the dress and suit the stylists had picked out for them and ascended the red carpet stairs. They were as charming as the actors last night, no, to my biased eyes, they were more charming than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spectators cheered and photographers pressed their shutter buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha was almost hugging Director Oh Hyunkyung as she made a pose for the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw Mason Tucker and Megan Shannor's red-carpet event yesterday..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess this is what they call 'on a different level'. It's a little deflating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff from the production company mumbled as they waited to enter the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pulled on my tight bowtie and looked at the sight in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw the spectators who came over before leaving after losing interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photographers who took pictures as a formality before looking for other famous people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha made her best smile at the last remaining photographer. Nam Joyoon and Director Oh Hyunkyung were slightly taken aback before smiling and waving as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stared at this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to light a fire in Lee Songha's heart with this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a fire lit in my heart before I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korean press reporters who had ID cards hung around their necks were sitting at one side of the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, most of the seats are taken. I was worried this red-carpet event would look sparse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the case for red-carpet events that don't have famous people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's not write articles that it was shabby or whatever and try to write them in a positive light. Then the mood at the press conference will be good. Something like 'the theater was packed with international reporters and buyers'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thousand or so seats were slowly being filled. It was empty compared to films that had 3,000 seats and had people standing to watch from the sides, but it was still a full house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Make sure to check how many times they clap or cheer during the screening. Also, get some feedback on the film from international reporters later too. And time how long they clapped after the official screening and publish headlines like 'Heated Applause for 5 minutes' or something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They applaud out of manners though. We're probably the only country that times the applause and writes articles about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middle-aged reporter clicked his tongue at the sudden complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we don't have that, then there's nothing to write about! Also, our citizens are curious about it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you think they'll have a chance at winning the award?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone cautiously asked. People murmured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People seem to think their chances are nil considering how top-notch their competitors are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How did people react to City Jungle's internal screening? Was the film any good?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From what I picked up, it seemed to be decent. The scenario is good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering they were invited to Cannes, the film must be quite polished as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, there are films that have been bashed for degrading the quality of the film festival. There are also a lot of people who leave in the middle of the screening. Around fifty to sixty people just got up and left last time. The mood was utter crap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, an article about it exploded and made the film flop back home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The middle-aged man licked his lips and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyways, we have to write that they have a chance of winning the reward until the award ceremony, so I hope the audience likes it. Our general manager had a fit about how we needed to get tons of newsworthy content because City Jungle is the most topical back home out of the films that were invited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be great if they receive an award though. It's been a long time since we've last received an award. For our film industry..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't try to fool us. Isn't it because you invested in City Jungle through their crowdfunding event?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shh, it looks like they're starting now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience's chatter gradually died down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international reporters and buys, who didn't seem particularly interested, turned their gazes towards the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:30 am. In the Debussy Theatre next to the main theater, Grand Theatre Lumiere, City Jungle's press screening began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a very quiet start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; The Korean name of the film has 'City' before 'Jungle'. The English name has 'Jungle' before 'City'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 16:16:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 215-216</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78587/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 215: Management Business Division Team 4 Leader (4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone who gathered in Supernatural's production meeting room darted their eyes. They should be opening champagne thanks to the unexpected effective marketing strategy, but the mood was gloomy. It was because of Director Cha Jaeho, whose eyes glowered as he sat in the seat of honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Irritable Cha, what's got him all worked up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A female employee wrote on the planner of her co-worker sitting next to her. Her co-worker silently showed her his phone under the table. The article headline on it read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{City Jungle hits crowdfunding goal in 1 hour, breaking the previous record}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanging glances, the production employees tried to flatter Director Cha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director, why are you so concerned about City Jungle? They aren't even on our level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our breakeven point is 4.2 million, and our goal is 10 million. They will be over the moon if they reach 4 million with that film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no comparing directors either. You're a master, and she's a greenhorn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be honest, if not for Jung Sunwoo, City Jungle wouldn't have been such a hot topic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho, who seemed to relax at being called a master, grew sullen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can I not be concerned?! I'm about to collapse from high blood pressure because of that bastard! Do you know what that Jung Sunwoo bastard said-!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His employees perked their ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something scandalous was going on between W&amp;amp;U's Jung Sunwoo and Director Cha Jaeho, and although everyone was hush-hush about it, they knew that Jung Sunwoo stabbed Director Cha Jaeho in the back because of it. This was because the director made several outbursts on set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That bastard, that cocky bastard said...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho opened and closed his mouth a few times before bursting into a tirade of curses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, soon, he turned around with glittering eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where is the marketing coordinator?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Has City Jungle not started accepting funds? Why won't my payment go through?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It's been sold out, dear customer. The exit is on your left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-LOL I was fortunate enough to do it as soon as they launched it. If not, I might have missed out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Oh my god. I missed it because I was careless. I succeeded in buying tickets to a solo concert that sold out in a minute and never failed to sign up for classes, but how could I miss this?! I'm speechless. q.q Why won't they take my money when I want them to!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Their original time frame was a week. Won't they increase the funding goal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I thought everyone moved to Supernatural because that's all they were talking about. Were all those posts made by Heo Kakyung fans? Or was this the big picture of those who wanted to get rid of competitors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I knew this would happen. Since crowdfunding became a hot topic because of Jung Sunwoo lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-But do all you investors think you'll profit? Because it's Jung Sunwoo's film? Only a few crowdfunded films until now have profited. You guys are better off investing in shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I only put in 100,000 won. It said that I would receive a VIP screening ticket as well as a general advance purchase ticket, so I didn't think I would be losing much even if I lost all of it. Looking at other community sites, it looks like there are tons of people who invested 100,000 won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I put in 1,000,000! To be honest, half because of expectations and half for fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-2,000,000 for me! Half for never-failing Jung Sunwoo, half because I'm Lee Songha's fan. Songha, let's get another hit!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbonated bubbles surged up glasses. Having received soda, the employees were chuckling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If not for the fact you're still working, I wouldn't have popped some champagne!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, let's get in the mood!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this was a simple celebration at the office, the mood was as though we won the world cup. People chatted while pouring soda into champagne flutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the producer messaged me, I was like 'Is this guy on drugs?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This guy? On drugs?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I mean, it just doesn't make sense logically! It ended as soon as it launched!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We left our mark on the history of crowdfunding films! The Jung Sunwoo effect is incredible!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told you! It's more effective than bringing an actor in a star marketing campaign!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't even count the number of flutes that clinked with mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I did expect a pretty decent result when I sprinkled 'investments' onto my special image, this was beyond my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soda instantly poured down my throat. My frustrations that built up from Supernatural's media manipulation was swept away. I was receiving tons of messages from W&amp;amp;U too. Team Leader Park was laughing about how she missed her chance to invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It still feels surreal to me. I asked a few of my friends to invest, but I guess I was worried for nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film production company Forest's CEO looked partly out of it as he laughed. He didn't have any alcohol, yet his face was red. I looked at the employees behind him and asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did Director Oh Hyunkyung not come?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, I told her to come even for a moment, but Director Oh is really focused right now. She said that she would make a few adjustments after the feedback we received from internal screenings. She really looks... I can't even strike up a conversation with her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recalled the film I saw at the screening. It made me lose my sleep for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just then, SBE Film's CEO and project producer, as well as World Art Pictures' general manager, approached me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The platform is asking if we have any plans on raising our goal. They say that they are receiving a crazy amount of inquiries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We originally considered 300 million as our maximum. Is there a reason to be greedier?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, that's true, but the public is so..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's CEO and project producer licked their lips. World Art's general manager shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we raise the target, it'll put pressure on us internally. Also, on our partial investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a slight conflict of opinions, we eventually decided not to increase our goal. We were already fully enjoying the marketing effects of having reached our goal in one hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer raised his glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyways, it's an overwhelming victory for us in terms of crowdfunding! There are probably a few of you who couldn't get enough sleep from Supernatural or whatever, but now you can sleep easy!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter shook the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the smiles of victors quickly faded the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Supernatural vs City Jungle}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title, which seemed for suited for the octagon, quickly spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly looking at the production scale, Supernatural should be competing with foreign films because Supernatural's scale was three times that of City Jungle. That was why the reporters writing those titles and the public weren't comparing the number of viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the two films that asked for crowdfunding, which one would pass their breakeven point and give their general investors a share of the profits? This was precisely the part people were excitedly comparing and discussing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people from Supernatural skillfully brought in general investors who participated in the crowdfunding. Selling snake oil again about how they were making the film with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City Jungle's marketing budget was small so we worked hard to market through our crowdfunding event, but Supernatural wasn't satisfied with getting the first taste and now was trying to suck our work dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marketing teams on either side clashed even more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sparks ignited by Supernatural were enough to burn an entire mountain. In particular, general investors became passionate marketers and were competing on various fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition always sparked people's interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, after the story about how Lee Songha was offered the position as the female lead of Supernatural but was filming City Jungle because of my decision was leaked to the public, people's interest shifted immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 'Would Jung Sunwoo's next project, 'City Jungle', succeed or fail?' to 'Which of the two, 'City Jungle' or 'Supernatural', bring in higher projects?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know the 3scene interview you did last time?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park approached me. Her firepower was surging these days from fighting with Supernatural's marketing team, but today, she had a miserable expression on her face for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That special interview?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3scene. It was a well-known national film professional magazine. One where film production companies and marketing agencies would do anything to put on the cover or do a special interview for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We gave up on getting the cover because a Hollywood series blockbuster was decided to be on it already. From what I remember, that was why we set up a photoshoot with Lee Songha, Nam Joyoon, Director Oh Hyunkyung, and me as well as a special interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did it come out?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It did. It did but..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? Is there a problem?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is... a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park handed me the magazine she had brought over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess they paid a ton for the advert."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Supernatural, Director Cha Jaeho' was on the cover in huge letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with a photoshoot of Heo Kakyung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suddenly received a call from my mother in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Sunwoo, your film... City, City, what was it again? I keep forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"City Jungle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Yeah, that. Do you not have any commercials on TV? I went to the hair salon today, and they were advertising Supernatural or whatever on TV. All the ladies were talking about how fun it looked and that they should go watch it once it releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also advertised on TV."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-You did? Why haven't I seen it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't buy a large volume, so we need to wait for the right time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Supernatural shows up whenever I turn on the TV. Young people can just look it up on the internet, but older people will probably have to see it on TV to know about it. Why didn't you buy more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It costs a ton, mom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Really? But I heard you raised 300 million? That's what your brother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did. But playing a 15-second ad for a few days costs a few hundred million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-... Oh my, what robbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we were doing better if we looked at viral or word-of-mouth marketing online, we couldn't compare to Supernatural in just the sheer volume of ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autograph signing events, exhibition shows with the Supernatural cast, and campaigns or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hosted these large events every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supernatural's ads weren't just on TV or in newspapers but also on buses, the subway, theatre banners, online portal banners, and even walls outside. Supernatural ads were everywhere. Wherever I walked, wherever I drove, there was always an ad about the damn Supernatural film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was just insufferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time I saw Director Cha Jaeho was on the parking lot of a newspaper company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He seemed to have come for an interview as he was all dressed up. He frowned as soon as he saw me. Of course, my expression wasn't great either. We were no longer in a situation where we could exchange pleasantries, so we greeted each other with foul words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... This competition isn't all that bad for City Jungle either, no? What is that, yeah, they are putting you on the same level as us. You are also receiving a lot of the public's attention. How about you do an interview with me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho smirked like last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was about to pour out all the words I had been preparing for this moment when my phone rang. It was SBE Film's project producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the? Was this déjà vu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it was not as big of news as reaching our 300-million-won crowdfunding goal in one hour, I picked up the phone hoping it was at least some good news. Like last time, his side was very noisy. They were causing such a ruckus that my eardrum hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, producer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed I wasn't the only one who remembered last time as Director Cha Jaeho's expression crumbled like he had swallowed a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gulped before hanging up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I looked at Director Cha Jaeho and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do the interview by yourself. I, we might have to go to France."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wh-why France?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apparently, we've received an invitation. From Cannes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked like he needed some time to process what I just said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn't plan on waiting for me. I felt like I had to hurry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I need to hurry up and leave today. Ah, I hope your interview goes well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I said this, Director Cha Jaeho's face turned sour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 216: Splendid or Shabby (1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannes International Film Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It with Venice and Berlin Film Festivals were considered the top 3 film festivals in the world, but judging by status, Cannes International Film Festival was unequaled. Around 2,000 films are submitted to the Cannes Film Festival every year. Around 50 of them were invited for their official selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only three works in the country were invited to the Cannes International Film Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, none were in the 'Competition', the main event of the festival. The other two films were in the 'Out of Competition' section, while City Jungle was in the 'Un Certain Regard' section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung was nominated for the 'Camera d'Or', which rewards the best first film among debutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though there were 24 competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this was also why City Jungle became a hot topic again. While it was in the other sections, it was the only one that could potentially win an award. I say it again, but competition really brings out the public's excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters and the public were very curious about whether City Jungle will be able to win an award at the film festival. Articles were published constantly without us having to make a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Err, this makes me feel like a national athlete going to an international competition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest's CEO said while rubbing his chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the reporters ask about is whether we think we'll win the 'Un Certain Regard' award or the 'Camera d'Or' award or not. All they ask about are the awards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's because only our film was nominated for awards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's project producer said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Forest's CEO, who would be attending Cannes International Film Festival for the first time, looked like he was about to pass out, SBE Film's people, who had attended the festival a few times before, looked calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for me, well, it was great that I had a poker face on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's nothing we can do about the reporters making a fuss, but don't get your hopes up on receiving an award. People over there are incredibly stuck-up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer said while looking at Forest's employees and me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While countless Korean films were invited to Cannes over the years, it was still worth celebrating if one was nominated in a competition with 20 or so films. They had never received a 'Palme d'Or' award.&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can still dream, right? How would you feel if you won the best award?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amazing. It's like winning the gold medal in the Olympics!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I bet we'll probably receive a prize from the government? I heard they give medals if you receive the 'Un Certain Regard' award?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faces of people gathered around started to flush red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's an article saying that Mason Tucker will be attending Cannes International Film Festival!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung clung to my waist as she followed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was more knowledgeable about who was attending the festival this year than I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Megan Shanner too! And Aaron Taylor! Mason arrived last night and is staying in the Majestic Hotel. What do I do, oppa!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do you mean 'what do you do'?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't I go with you? With my money! I'll use my own money for everything! Just give me a ticket in!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop joking and work hard on your radio and TV broadcasts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Euahh! Mason!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Im Seoyoung was shouting out a Hollywood star's name, Lee Taehee and LJ were looking through Lee Songha's luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why aren't there a lot of snacks? It's unlike you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having been thrown over Lee Songha's shoulder before, LJ gave her a look of suspicion. I also glanced at Lee Songha. I packed the daily necessities and her stylist packed her clothes, so I expected half her luggage to be filled with snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was definitely less than normal for Lee Songha. Don't tell me there was a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Songha, did you lose your appetite? Do you not crave chips?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha said as if telling me not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to get them over there. There'll be French snacks in France."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So like her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We left their residence while being sent off by the girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, our way to Incheon International Airport was surprisingly traffic-free today. The sky was blue, and the breeze that blew in was warm and comfortable. It felt like I was driving in the sky than on asphalt. My heart throbbed just enough to feel good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were going to Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glamorous place full of world-class actors, directors, production companies and agencies. We were going to the place where I hoped I would one day go when I took my first step into the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I changed the present on my own, I now had a piece of the future I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard someone humming. When I looked beside me, Lee Songha was smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you excited?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn't look all that excited when she swept up all the rookie awards at the broadcasting and film awards at the end of last year. Did Cannes just feel different?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you most excited about?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are going to be tons of famous actors from all over the world over there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you have any actors you want to see?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not it. Since actors there will be much more famous than me, no one will pay me any interest. Actors who went to Cannes last year said that they wore slippers and leisurely walked around Boulevard de la Croisette. There won't be anyone who recognizes me there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... That's true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her name was quite known nationally and in China, she was relatively unknown internationally. There wouldn't be anyone who recognizes her unless they were Korean reporters reporting on Cannes or correspondents there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was she under a lot of stress from her fame?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why do you want to go around without anyone recognizing you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cannes apparently has beautiful beaches."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha smiled subtly as she gave me an irrelevant answer. Then she took out a book from her handbag. It was a tourist guidebook on Cote d'Azur in Cannes. She seemed to have already gone through it once as there were index stickers sticking out from various pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can you be more interested in sightseeing than the film festival? Did you give up on the award already?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apparently, the harbor is full of super luxurious yachts during the festival. Oppa, do you want to go on a yacht?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do, but what's important is... What are you writing right now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While questing Lee Songha, who was smiling wickedly, we arrived at the airport. We went to the airport with the help of security guards and were met with reporters and spectators forming a long line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Kwanwoo, who was managing the situation, came over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have our staff arrived? Where's Joyoon hyung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They already arrived. He's with the staff members. Also, we've been receiving a lot of requests for an interview before we take off. What should we do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tell them that we'll do a short one. Reporters won't expect any more than that considering how cluttered things are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After sending Lee Kwanwoo off, I went to where the staff were gathering. The staff, which included stylists, makeup and hair artists, were piling up their luggage carriers. Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup were sitting in the middle. When I came over, Nam Joyoon was on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, father. It's in Cannes. Cannes. Yes, Cannes. No, Cannes. France. Film festival."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup was watching, frustrated, before finally taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello, this is Hyunsup. We arrived at the airport to board the flight. It's Cannes. Similar to how to pronounce tin can&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt;. It's a city in France, and they hold a film festival every year. It's the most famous film festival in the world. Joyoon, this guy, has been invited to attend. Of course, this guy's completely turned around his career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon shook his head slightly, but Kim Hyunsup began to more in a more dynamic manner,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the most famous film festival in the world. Ah, the award... There's meaning in just attending this festival. There are a lot of people working in the film industry that dream of being invited here. You can go boast about it all over town. You can even hang a banner at the village hall!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this rate, you might..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon grimaced. Kim Hyunsup seemed to catch his mistake and quietly added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not tell your wife about the banner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kim Hyunsup hung up, the staff, who had been suppressing their laughs, finally burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Nam Joyoon, who took back his phone,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung, how are you feeling?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm fine. This all feels so unreal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon smiled in a slightly bitter manner. Then his gaze alternated between Lee Songha and me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Songha... You look fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha replied like it was nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was extremely fine. Because her mind was elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sunwoo, how about you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's your first time going to Cannes too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, I think I'll have to see the palm trees for it to really sink in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lightly shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ms. Lee Songha! It's your first time attending the Cannes International Festival, how do you feel?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uh, it's unexpected, so I think I'll have to see the palm trees for it to really sink in. Thank you very much for supporting us. I'll go and see, experience, and learn a lot over there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do either of you have any promises if you receive the award?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Countless movie fans are hoping you return in glory, please give us a comment!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we told them that this would be quick, reporters viciously swarmed at them like starved chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I checked the time before jumping in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, we are on a tight schedule so we'll have to head in now. We plan on holding an official press interview in Cannes, so we can talk in a more relaxed fashion over there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cut them off and urged my group to move. Reporters pushed onwards, asking us to answer one last question. In the end, the safe line collapsed, and security guards had to hold them back. This sight was familiar since I've experienced this multiple times going to and coming from China, but this was on another level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was comparable to how one would send off a national athlete when they went to the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production staff and Director Oh Hyunkyung left a couple of days ahead of us and we were the second group, It was great that we moved separately. It was this crazy with just us. It would have been even more chaotic if we had the production staff with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have a safe flight!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard the reporters cheering us from behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transferring in Paris, 13 hours had passed when we arrived at Nice Cote d'Azur International Airport. Because there was a 7-hour time difference, the sky was still blue when we arrived at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be quiet here, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup asked as he dragged the luggage carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Probably. We don't know how many reporters arrived ahead of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was exhausting when there were a lot of reporters, but thinking about how there won't be anyone makes me sad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He licked his lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unexpectedly, we encountered a blast of heat as soon as we got out. Foreign reporters holding cameras and spectators who came from all across the world filled the airport. Their excited voices pierced my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Uh, don't tell me they're here for us?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone cut Kim Hyunsup off. When I turned around, it was SBE Film's project producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked at the reporters as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aaron Taylor's coming on a private jet. They're gathered here to see him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wow, a private jet... This is actually happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup said in astonishment. The project producer laughed as he led the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The really rich come on their private yachts. Super luxurious yachts that are so big they can't moor at the harbor. You see them floating around when you go to the beach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We leisurely made our way through the airport. There was no need to rush. Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon were clearly revealing their faces, but there was no one who recognized them. They were all busy trying to see Hollywood stars that they didn't spare a glance at us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was too drastic of a difference compared to the heated reactions at Incheon Airport. It felt like we would freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there were a few Korean reporters who arrived before us and asked for an interview and some pictures. The staff grinned as they were happy to see them. We left the airport after holding a sufficiently long interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ms. Songha and Mr. Joyoon will take the car sent by the film festival."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to the luxurious cars waiting for them. Kim Hyunsup's eyes glittered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What about us?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll wait here and take the shuttle bus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was a joke. We'll follow them in the car the production company prepared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff, who were barely managing to stand tall after the 13-hour flight, almost flopped down when they heard about the shuttle bus, only regaining their strength after hearing it was a joke. The project producer made a strange smile. After Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon got in the car did he quietly talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, it's your first time attending Cannes, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a complete class system here. They discriminate against you according to your 'level'. They give you ID cards depending on your 'level'. They prepare accommodations and plan tickets according to your 'level'. Your 'level' also decides how many screenings and which parties you can attend. And our 'level' isn't very high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grabbed my shoulder and added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be best if you prepare yourself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; This chapter came out before Parasite by Director Bong Joon-Ho received the 2019 Palme d'Or award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt; The Korean example in the raws is closer to the actual pronunciation of Cannes than this. I just tried to find a quick replacement. If you know a better example, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:33:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 213-214</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78586/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 213: Management Business Division Team 4 Leader (2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader! Team-team leader!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road manager who had been waiting for me outside ran over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tell me about the situation. How is she?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think she's about to explode. The set has been an icy battlefield for hours now. The staff were causing a fuss since a while ago. I tried to calm her down with snacks, but she didn't even give them a glance. I couldn't handle it any longer...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you couldn't handle it, you should have contacted me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lowered his stiff hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry! I was threatened, no, told not to contact you no matter what. I felt like the set would be flipped upside down at this rate, so I hid and contacted you in secret. She calms down in front of you...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, he had looked like he was dreaming after being assigned to Lee Songha, but his face now looked like he was suffering from nightmares even though it hasn't been a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uh, you are talking about Lee Songha, right? Not Son Chaeyoung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon asked with dazed eyes as he followed us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sighed as I waved my hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I followed the road manager who quickly took the lead. As soon as I stepped onto the set, I felt like I heard ice crack. There were dozens of people here, yet it was oddly quiet. Only the sound of camera shutters interrupted the silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha was covered in flowers. She buried her cheek in a bouquet of yellow freesia flowers. She slightly bit one as she smiled brightly. As soon as I saw her, I was caught by a chilly emotion. It felt like an awl was lodged in the back of my neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Smile properly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photographer said. Lee Songha's lips curved even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have been smiling. For six hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So smile properly. Properly. Prop. Per. Ly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha bit her lower lip at his shifty orders. Her face looked like she had endured enough and was about to explode. Clenching on the bouquet like she was about to crush it, Lee Songha lifted her gaze. The next moment, her gaze met mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her surprised face instantly distorted. Lee Songha glared at the road manager. The road manager made a sound like he was being strangled. At the same time, the photographer put his camera down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's take a break to cool our heads then come back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha immediately got up and came over with steadfast steps. It seemed like she might pull out a gun from the bouquet. Chief Lee Bongjoon backed away. Lee Songha simply passed us as she entered her waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Did she just ignore you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon whispered with a flustered face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is she like that? Did you two fight?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then I don't understand? You said that this isn't the first time she's been causing trouble. Has the troublemaker title at our company been passed on from Son Chaeyoung to Lee Songha? While she wasn't normal, she at least acted normally before. Why is she acting out now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung Sunwoo? You're Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, correct?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard a woman's voice. She was the editor I had met a couple times at photoshoots. She rushed over to us and clung to my arm like a lamb having found her savior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Father in Heaven, thank you! Team leader, please save us!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry, Songha is not in a very good condition today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's true. I thought so. The photographer didn't help either."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The editor glanced at the back of the photographer's head before clinging onto me again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader! It'll be big trouble if the photoshoot today fails. A huge problem! It took considerable effort to get the dress and jewels sponsored for today's shoot from overseas, and we won't be able to set this up again. Could you...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please wait. I'll go talk to her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the other behind, I entered the waiting room alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha was sitting on a chair with her head down low. Her breathing was even ragged. It seemed like she tried to calm down the best she could as her exposed shoulders heaved up and down. When I approached her, I saw crushed, empty water bottles rolling on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll get you some more water."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turned around but almost fell. Lee Songha was holding the back of my knees with both hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where are you going?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To get you water."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't need it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her head was still way down. I fumbled with my pockets and took out a bunch of caramel that I had brought with me. She didn't react even when I waved it in front of her eyes. On after I unwrapped one and put it in her mouth did she start to chew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, say my name again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lee Songha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you want me to make an acrostic poem?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joked, and she answered with a sigh-like laugh. She seemed to have calmed down as she raised her head. Then she quickly took her hands off my knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry, I had blood on my hands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't have blood on your hands, and are you not feeling well?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha lowered her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hazy. I almost swore at the photographer. That damn b-photographer was right. Today's concept is the innocent freesia, yet I don't know what an innocent expression is. I'm doomed. Flowers like these no longer suit me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then what kind of flowers suit you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Marijuana."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms were severe today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Or a pitcher plant, or Venus flytrap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those aren't even flowers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. There are no flowers in my life. Since my life is a jungle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are probably flowers in the jungle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I locked the waiting room door and lightly patted Lee Songha's head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought you were getting better with those counseling sessions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I have dissociative identity disorder. Or intermittent explosive disorder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the proper term for multiple personality and anger management disorders. I saw it on the internet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't joke and have another caramel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has already been a long time since filming was done, but Lee Songha still couldn't get out of the female lead role from City Jungle. From what the counselor said, there were occasional cases where an actor became too absorbed in their role that it affected their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it really looked like she was possessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she was similarly absorbed in her role in previous works, she quickly turned back to normal afterward. Was her role in City Jungle particularly intense? There was a time where she flipped LJ over for touching her shoulder, and even a time when she couldn't eat meat. Since her role was a vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had only been worried about the end results for the film. I didn't think I would be worried about something like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told you to call me if there was a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I tried to handle it on my own. I can't keep doing that. I was planning on carrying a miniature of you since I return to reality when I'm with you. But it was too difficult to make, so I gave up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead, I found a place that'll make it for you with a 3D printer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just call me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I already ordered it. They said they already finished the head."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha said while chewing her caramel defiantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, okay, whatever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I'll just live with a bit of humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha's head slowly leaned over until she rested her forehead on my belly. Then, like a woodpecker, she hit her head repeatedly, and sometimes made noises that were either violent or pitiful. During that time, I rubbed her head like I was stroking her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she raised her head up and smiled. It was a smile of innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the investment company managing City Jungle's crowdfunding project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vested parties gathered for the meeting at the company founded for funding projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How about we set the crowdfunding period to a week before release?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since this is for marketing purposes, why don't we set the goal low? If we don't reach our goal, it'll only result in unpleasant rumors. It'll also lessen the topicality and expectations. It'll also be embarrassing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, on the other hand, if we set the goal too low, it'll look like we aren't confident. It'll look like we are trying to save ourselves. The press is watching this, so it'll be worse than not doing it if we set the goal too low!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat near the window as I looked through the files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were presentation slides introducing the film and investments, expectations on returns depending on viewership as well as previous crowdfunding scenarios among other things were clearly organized. They even mentioned me in the introduction of actors and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posters of competing films released around the same time were on the last page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list went from national blockbusters to famous Japanese animations. Our competition was no joke. Well-Made delayed the blockbuster they had originally planned and put City Jungle in its place, but there were reporters that were already saying this was a throwaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn't completely false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While looking through the posters, I stopped at one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ace Distribution Company. Director Cha Jaeho. Leads Heo Kakyung and Han Seoyeon. Breakeven point at 4.2 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was being released at almost the same time as City Jungle. On the same week, maybe even the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were rumors that they were prepared to pour billions of won into publicity and advertisement to compete against Hollywood blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did I say to Director Cha Jaeho last year? That I thought it would flop terribly? I definitely remembered how he cursed me. The back of my head felt itchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licking my lips, I flipped to City Jungle's rate of return forecast in regards to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our breakeven point was 1.6 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People could invest at least 100,000 won to at most 2,000,000 won. If we passed the breakeven point, we would get a positive rate of return, but if not, a negative one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that was left was deciding what to set our crowdfunding goal to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm telling you, lower is better. How about a hundred million to a hundred-fifty million?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And I'm saying that'll make it seem like we aren't confident in our end product. We need it to be 300 million won at most."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production company employees and producers were debating the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tapped my notebook with the tip of my pen before saying,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't we just decide after we've had our internal screening for the final product?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood became strange. The expressions of the general manager from Well-Made Pictures, who argued for a smaller goal, SBE Film's CEO, who argued for a larger goal, and Forest's CEO, who was busy playing both sides, turned complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Made's general manager said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm asking because you brought it up, but how did you like the draft version?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Drafts are just drafts. We need to decide after seeing the final product. Our director is working hard editing the film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we call it a draft, it's what we're submitting to the Cannes Film Festival. You can consider it as the final version."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone's expression looked like they were just remembering that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were going to submit an edited version of City Jungle to Cannes Film Festival. While there were some who held hopes it would advance, another goal was to use that it was submitted to an international film festival as a way to promote it in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, Director Oh Hyunkyung took a break in the real world before going back to increase the film's polish. Staff who took a glance inside were astonished, saying that Director Oh Hyunkyung had been bitten by the editing bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's CEO looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it'll do well in the film festival, don't you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe we might have a chance to go to France if we're lucky."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's CEO stealthily rubbed his chest as though my words calmed his nerves. Although I changed the future and could no longer be certain of the results, I was sure that it was a film that would do well at film festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Made's general manager licked his lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Film festivals are good and all, but our box office performance is also important. The film is good. It is. But I thought this since reading the scenario and watching the draft, but it definitely lacks commercial value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to release it to know for sure. Last year, '17 Days with You' expected only a million viewers due to lack of commercial value after their internal screening, but in the end, they hit 2.5 million viewers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are more cases where that isn't the case. To be honest, we aren't really interested in large profits and hope that we can at least hit the breakeven point. Aren't we going to use all the money gathered through crowdfunding directly to marketing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you saying you want us to spend less money on marketing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not it. If our crowdfunding goal is too large and our viewership numbers are lukewarm, the dividends..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And things became loud once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after the meeting, we held an internal screening with vested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night, we decided to set the goal to 300 million won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, did you put on makeup because you're going to be filmed?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You did, you did. It looks like you also trimmed your brows?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I turned around, the people stuck to my door acted like they were doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to interfere with the audio, so please leave. Also, I didn't touch my brows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, let's quiet down so that we don't interfere with the audio!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had no thoughts on leaving and simply shut their mouths. I looked at the Team 3 Leader, Kim Hyunjo, and Chief Lee Bongjoon at the front before simply shaking my head. The director fixing the white balance on the camera chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shall we begin?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I coughed and cleared my throat at the director's question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a promotional video for City Jungle's crowdfunding event. Other actors, including Nam Joyoon and Lee Songha, had already filmed their part during filming, and I was the last. We planned on sending it out to the press and putting up on our crowdfunding webpage once it has been edited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already began sending out press releases. We pour out all we could for a press conference and events to publicize and advertise the film. We had already started promoting it as well. The public's reactions were growing heated as though they had been waiting for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, because most the attention is on crowdfunding, marketing employees were paying particular attention to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was reciting the words I had prepared in front of the camera, the PR Team's female employee squeezed in through the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She looked agitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tema leader! Please stop filming for a moment! Su-Supernatural! Our competition!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What about it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They decided to start crowdfunding too!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Articles are being published as we speak! Their goal is 800 million won."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 214: Management Business Division Team 4 Leader (3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sly. Detestable. Sneaky. No, these were excessively nice descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pieces of trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{This Year's Hot Keyword for Films, Interest in Crowdfunding Soars.}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Two Films Attempt Crowdfunding, 'City Jungle' and 'Supernatural'}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Supernatural Opens Crowdfunding with an 800-Million-Won Goal, 'Largest Ever'}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... Director Cha Jaeho of Supernatural stated that 'Mr. Heo Kakyung, the lead, expressed he wanted to use crowdfunding the join the audience together' and that 'they decided to proceed after confirming that it was a good project in a meeting'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in regards to the other film their crowdfunding project overlaps with, City Jungle (Director Oh Hyunkyung, Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon as leads), he said, "I have a close relationship with Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, who first planned the crowdfunding event. I also sent him my scenario while he succumbed to the pressure of choosing his next project" and that 'he wished both films would have good results even though they are competitors, so that it would add more energy to the national film industry'...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahaha, how absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supernatural was dragging us by our hair for their marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They constantly mentioned City Jungle in their crowdfunding press release and kept bringing up Lee Songha and me as well. It was all so that those looking for more information on City Jungle, Lee Songha, or me would naturally see information about Supernatural as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this rate, Supernatural might appear as a top search keyword amongst City Jungle related searches!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wow, did they shove their manners down the toilet? Isn't this too much?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was looking to regain my senses, the PR Team's female and male employees, the Team 3 Leader as well as others surrounded a monitor and were discussing. Realizing the mood wasn't very good, the camera director had long since left with his camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heo Kakyung brought it up first? Look at how they are using the actor as a scapegoat in case they get criticized!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It did work though. Looking at the comments, 'Kakyung oppa is famous for loving his audience. Let's hit ten million viewers. Fighting!' is what someone wrote. 'I looked up what kind of movie Supernatural was, and it's a blockbuster with a 15 billion won budget'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Sung Uimin said as he looked at his phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And where's Team Leader Park?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PR Team female employee replied with an agitated face,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is flipping out- I mean lodging a complaint to Supernatural's marketing agency!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Succumbed? Succumbed to the pressure of choosing his next project?! Have you seen Jung Sunwoo ever succumb?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Team Leader Park was flipping out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her phone stuck to her ear, she approached us while shouted loudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if promoting City Jungle isn't my business, promoting Jung Sunwoo is my business! It's not like he had an interview with a reporter. Even if Director Cha Jaeho did say that, you should have removed it from the press release! Don't you know this is a sensitive subject?! Already, reporters' eyes are shining, looking to prey on anything!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park's torrential criticism ended with,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop saying sorry, and make sure not to do it again. I hope that we never have to call you again for something like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanging up, Team Leader Park let out a sigh. The Team 3 Leader said in a dazed voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weren't you too harsh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a company known to have hired part-timers to review bomb competing films. They'll look down on us if we tried to talk nicely. They know not to mess with us if we flip out like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park looked towards me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you ever hear any unpleasant words from Director Cha Jaeho? If they are mentioning you, we probably have to intimidate them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unpleasant words."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recalled my memories before saying,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You work so foolishly. Han Seoyeon is much better than Lee Songha. Stuff like that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? You didn't do anything when you heard that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't just listen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I told him that I thought Supernatural was going to be a huge flop and that there was no need for me to put my actors in to flop with it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My surroundings became quiet. Team Leader Park opened and closed her mouth a couple times before changing the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SBE Film is going to discuss with their marketing agency about the crowdfunding. They are probably in an uproar too. They sold your name for the past six months trying to raise people's interest and expectations, only to have Supernatural take the first bite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her face became distorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What pisses me off more is that this will be greatly effective in promoting Supernatural."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really was greatly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was nothing to say about how they swept through the real-time search rankings. As soon as Supernatural's crowdfunding event became known, people quickly went to invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it was objectively an appealing option. It was a large-scale blockbuster. It had a well-known director and top star leads. Supporting roles were also famous for being great in their roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of investors and the amount of funds received kept going up without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, in just one day, they surpassed 200 million won."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters wrote articles about how Supernatural would reach the highest crowdfunding goal among national films at this rate. Ln a large portal site, articles about Supernatural, albeit with different headlines, continued to be in the 'Most Viewed News' section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the public who invested in Supernatural became marketers as they spread information about Supernatural here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, City Jungle staff were suffering from symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their stomachs hurt, heartburns, and irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a disorder caused by rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's project producer complained every day about how his stomach hurt and felt like his insides were twisted. The only calm person was Director Oh Hyunkyung who still locked herself in the editing room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, even in this situation, City Jungle's promotional activities were proceeding smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes! Geumjoo's Culture Storage! This week, we had Mr. Jung Sunwoo, and we introduced City Jungle, which is about to be released. Join us next week for more plentiful news!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reporter shouted the close remark of the info program. The staff went up onto the studio to prepare for the next segment. As soon as I handed my mic over to the audio team, the producer and main writer approached me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung! You're going to help us cast an actor next week, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a recording of it. We really will call you!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main writer, who laughed in a friendly manner, added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, right! City Jungle's crowdfunding must have started already?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, it should be around an hour since it started."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I replied after checking my watch. Today was the grand opening of the crowdfunding event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, all the City Jungle staff were probably hung up on the crowdfunding platform. They were probably waiting impatiently for the aggregate results. After thanking the producer and writer, who said they would participate in funding, I went back to the waiting room to get my things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I barely managed to retain ahold of my senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director! I am interested in acting, so can't you use me in a minor role next time?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You too, unni? I received acting lessons in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be honest, my goal was to be a comedian/actor...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfamiliar celebrities were trying to strike a friendship in front of my waiting room. There were rookie girl group idols and a comedian. I checked the door in case I came to the wrong place, but it had 'Jung Sunwoo' in big letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait, wait. The waiting room owner has arrived."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard a familiar voice. When I turned my head, I unconsciously frowned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho was sitting amongst the celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uh, uh, hello!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The celebrities greeted me with surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Director Cha Jaeho chased the others away. Only after we were the only ones left in the room did he speak again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I came for a radio show, and I heard that you happened to be filming here too. So I came over to say hi."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why bother/"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our relationship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thoughts blurted out my mouth. Director Cha Jaeho's brows moved up and down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all thanks to you that the trend of crowdfunding began. This is a better marketing tool than I initially thought. We also receive investments. A stock firm said that our total funds and the rate we received funds is the best thus far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What should we do now that we beat historic records before you? We should leave City Jungle with something at least. I heard City Jungle started crowdfunding today?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho mocked. Maybe it was because he was an eyesore, but every orifice of his face irritated me. His creased forehead wrinkles looked like he was needlessly stubborn, and his thin lips made it seem like he was a horrible character. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you come here to pick a fight?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I asked, Director Cha Jaeho got up from the sofa and came over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I came to have you face reality. My film, which you rejected because you thought it would flop, is a work that has both commercial value and essential elements for box office success. Whether you call it dull or that we sold our soul for commercial value, in the end, the audience will buy tickets. Can't you tell by how people are clamoring to invest as soon as we set crowdfunding up?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His eyes glimmered with excitement. He repeatedly pushed my shoulder with his index finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you feel? Isn't it time for you to regret your decision? If you still haven't figured it out, then you're hopeless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there were multiple times where I thought, 'just where did a guy like him come from,' this man was the most absurd amongst all of them. To think that the guy causing trouble for me just because I rejected his scenario is one of the famous individuals in the movie industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, his expression read, 'You dare reject my work? Do you even know who I am?' Oh my god. Would he be satisfied if I said, 'Sorry for not seeing this sooner, teacher.&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; I was blind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho became more intimidating when I didn't answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... You dare reject my film because you think it'll flop? In all my twenty years as a director... It was so absurd that it appeared in my dreams!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was some good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How dare you, who chase after celebrities, squawk in front of me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's because you answered in a crude manner after I put it politely. That was why I matched your preferences and spoke crudely. I guess you didn't really like that. Also, I think there's a misunderstanding, but even if there was on City Jungle, I still wouldn't have done Supernatural."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You bastard!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not a bastard. The first digit of my age is changing this year too." &lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho, who was glaring at me, made a sarcastic remark,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seeing as your neck is still upright, I guess your film came out quite good. I saw that scenario too. Since it is my competitor. Well, it was okay. However, no matter how artistic you create a film, the audience in our country don't like dark, difficult films."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He seemed certain at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a clear limit. Even if rumors spread about how good the film is, at most, you'll have a million viewers. Well-Made will get you in theatres at first, and people will gather since they are curious, however, that'll only be for a moment. I bet that the number of viewers will half in a week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, I guess you can see the future. What an interesting ability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's obvious without that. The film market is pretty much a fight for a larger slice of the pie. How long do you think a film that turned its back on the public will last again blockbusters?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just then, my phone rang. It was SBE Film's project producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left Director Cha Jaeho aside and answered the phone. The background was full of loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Team leader! It's over! We're done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... What is?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-The crowdfunding!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It started one hour ago? Is there a problem?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It's over! We surpassed our goal of 300 million! In an hour!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guy must be experiencing side effects after taking too many pills for his heartburn... There's no way that's true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowdfunding has ended? We gathered 300 million in one hour? Not even a day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was that possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first put down my phone. I gulped dryly before turning my gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho was looking at me with his arms crossed. It seemed the project producer's voice didn't leak out. Director Cha Jaeho seemed to have assumed that there was a problem with funding from just my words as he arrogantly began talking about funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was City Jungle's goal 300 million? I was thinking about investing around 2 million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke as I hurriedly got my bag form the sofa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why? Do you not want my money? But our marketing agency said it would be a good idea. It'll be newsworthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can't accept even if we wanted to, though we don't. The funding's over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The funding. We checked the aggregate total, and it's done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's... done?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We reached our 300-million-won goal in one hour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho simply blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My expression was probably the same just moments ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I think I need to head back quickly. Ah, you can rest easy here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All he could do was open and close his mouth as he was so taken aback. Leaving him behind, I left the waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind me, I heard loud noises like a table being flipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Teacher here is used as a form of respect, how you would talk to someone deserving of respect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt; The word 'bastard' can also refer to babies as well. Hence the age comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 210-212</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78585/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 210: To Reach for the Stars, or to Become One (2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Err, uh, err, maybe not?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress poked the actor next to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Isn't he that person?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? Who?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jung Sunwoo!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name was suddenly mentioned. It was too loud to consider it a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theatre company members, who were examining Chief Lee Kyojin and wondering if he was one of those common scammers, quickly turned to look at me. Thinking this would be fast, I took off my glasses and hat. I even took off the university jacket I used for my disguise. This was a bit of a shame. I felt younger with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, yes, hello...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theatre members greeted me back before simultaneously reacting like they were on cue. I have become used this after my face became known, but it was strange considering it was actual actors reacting this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few more sociable members approached us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What a surprise! You really came regarding an audition?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wow, you shocked me. I was 80% sure that this was a scam!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's for City Jungle, right? Mr. Nam Joyoon and Ms. Lee Songha as the leads. The film being made by SBE Film! I saw an announcement for supporting and minor roles on the community site, so I was thinking about sending in my profile or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin, who retreated back at some point, crossed his arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... It seems there is no need for any further explanation. This gives me a strange sense of shame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Same here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup, who was leaning on one foot, tapped Nam Joyoon's arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just take off your mask and hat. There's no point since no one can recognize you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon took off his hat and mask as if he had been waiting for those words. The theatre members reacted even more loudly than before. Sort of like an idol holding a fan meeting? Their reaction was so cheerful and positive that it was strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The story behind you two is quite famous in our industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A story where an unknown actor meets a manager and they both support each other and succeed. It's romantic. I really hope you do well, Mr. Nam Joyoon. That way, people like us who threw away their lives to chase their dreams can continue with hope!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Park Hyejae! You become a film scene-stealer next year and get married!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this mood, we ended up in a snack stall. After a round of drinks, the theatre members became even rowdier. The captain of the group placed his arm around Park Hyejae, who was drinking with a complicated face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This bastard hasn't been able to get married for three years due to his to-be in-laws' refusal. That they couldn't give their daughter to a guy who can barely make ends meet acting in a small theatre company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop it. That's not something to brag about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Hyejae looked at me and Chief Lee Kyojin before asking,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What kind of role is it? Is it a minor one?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a supporting role. There are a lot of lines, and it's a very important role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All casting directors seem to say that though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Hyejae said bitterly at Chief Lee Kyojin's reply. The theatre members chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we have high hopes that it's a good role and go, there really are a lot of weird ones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was tricked by a casting director and auditioned for an erotic film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you all so negative? There was one time when I was introduced to a really good role. I passed the audition and attended a reading session, but they told me to leave after casting an actor that was more famous than me. Bastards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tons of movies and dramas come out every quarter, so why aren't there any roles for me?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess it's like how there are apartments everywhere, you can't afford one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theatre members' lives were all dramatic. Dramas that kept twirling down with no end in sight. Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup joined in. Nam Joyoon's life's hardships didn't lose out to anyone. His life was a hardcore drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting with Park Hyejae, we talked to his agency and scheduled an audition date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't seem to have much hope for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We saw hundreds of profile pictures again and again, and you stood out to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stopped his glass halfway at my words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your acting skills were better than expected, and I could visualize the film scene in my head as I saw the play. Although you'll be confirmed after an official audition, I'll cheer for you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Hyejae's neck reddened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theatre members gave him 'energy' by shoving more boilermakers down his throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We met multiple actors since that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some were recommended by Chief Lee Kyojin, and others stood out to me. Their charisma and skills were diverse. There were cases where I thought, 'that person's the one,' when I saw them act, and other times when I experienced shock and horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a lot more of the latter. A lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's because he's nervous!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director of an acting school clung to Chief Lee Kyojin's waist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than being nervous, she was unbelievably confident. It's like she not even reading off actual literature but a children's book. Why did Director Yoon recommend someone like her?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's because I haven't been learning for long."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female high schooler, whose terrible performance rivaled Im Seoyoung, defended herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wasn't fully prepared for the audition. If you give me some more time to practice, I'm confident I can act as good as Lee Songha unni! Also, to be honest, my face is better. She seems to benefit from the camera."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, she had the looks! Her face doesn't lose out...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director stopped talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha, who was standing there completely disguised as a film company employee, took off her hat. Her tied up hair fell loosely. After taking off her mask, her face was completely unveiled. The blankly staring director and high schooler shrunk back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin came over and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry, it seems that the director who recommended her to me is her relative or received something. That guy... What a loss of face after bringing Ms. Lee Songha all the way over here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather, I think the student who acted as her counterpart was good. She had a good image too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... You thought so too?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our gazes turned. The female student who played as the counterpart was sitting in a corner watching us. While eating a triangle kimbap. The next moment, she was coughing excessively after receiving Chief Lee Kyojin's business card and an audition offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're the ones who called for a replacement driver, correct? Where's your car?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man in his mid-twenties. His face had scars like he had been in fights. His punk-vibe face was quite good-looking, but his hoarse, glum voice was particularly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin chewed on a fry as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't bring a car."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Are you kidding? Then why did you call for a replacement driver?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because we wanted to talk to you about an audition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actor, who dazedly sat down in front of us, began pouring his heart about how shitty life was for having to chase auditions by day and work as a replacement driver at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I get a minor role, I get fired from part-time jobs where I have to be available at all times. I can endure all other things, but food is really... It makes me distressed. Sorry, but could I have a fry?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After showing off his impromptu acting skills full of sincerity, he received Chief Lee Kyojin and my business cards and left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinking our glasses, I said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There really are a lot of talented unknown actors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is still only the tip of the iceberg. I realized this while working in this industry, but if you want to become a star, you need both luck and opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin drank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This project, I think its casting luck is quite good. Good acting skills are different from being suited for the role, but quite a few actors caught my eye. I was worried at first since they said that we would have to cast lesser-known actors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We decided to purposely fill our cast with new faces. To look refreshing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a risk. It can go one way or another."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recalled the actors I met over the past few days as I drank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I didn't bring SBE Film into the picture, there would have been no way Chief Lee Kyojin became the casting director. Meaning that the supporting role candidates I met these past few days were very likely to have had no relationship with City Jungle in the original future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just the casting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung and the project producer were working hard trying to bring on skilled staff, like cameramen and audio directors. If things go well, the resulted would be different from the original future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After veering from the path my future showed me, I stopped seeing any visions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the present was constantly being changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a fast rate, like a tire rolling downhill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel was put up in an area that was a mess for a while due to construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;W&amp;amp;U Management Business Department Team 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was across from the PR Team's office on the fifth floor. I saw the team leader's office beside the company desks and partitions. I carefully opened the door. The office with a large desk and seats for guests was still empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat down on a chair and looked around this unfamiliar space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mumbled in a quiet voice. I felt a strange sensation rise up within me from my toes. Although it was small compared to the office my future self had, it was the first personal office I received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noises came in through my partly-opened door. Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung Uimin, as well as other members of the team, were unpacking their things. We decided early on to hold a get-together tonight. Moving day. It was a day worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team 4 Leader, when are you going to show us around?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was lost in my emotions, the Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo suddenly walked in holding a box of tissues and a palm-sized cactus. The Team 3 Leader looked around with an investigative eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Isn't your view better than mine? It also gets a lot of sunlight. How odd."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After you clashed with the CEO, there were rumors that your office would be moved to the basement. That's why there were many people coveting this office. Anyways, don't make yourself a nameplate just yet since you don't know how things will unfold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo's eyes narrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you cursing him? Didn't the CEO move past it after saying that he would be waiting for the results?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be that he hasn't had much time to pay attention to him because he's focused on other things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Team 3 Leader said, CEO Baek Hansung and the director rarely showed up at the company these days. They were busy going to China and the US. Seeing as they frequented Los Angeles, it looked like they were working on trying to get a foothold in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are agency and contract problems as well. Also, problems with investors. They probably have a lot of things to handle right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader clicked his tongue before changing the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How's City Jungle? Are things going well? Articles about you pop up regularly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll start filming as soon as we finish auditioning. Songha and Joyoon hyung are busy training with a martial artist director and coordinating with each other. Any moment now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't turn back anymore. You better succeed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. The timing will be the worst if you fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just then, the door burst open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Chief Lee Bongjoon stuck his head in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uh, can you come out and watch the TV?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees were already crowding around the large TV in the lounge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was airing a show that briefed people on gossip in the entertainment world like tabloids. I saw people coming out of the airport through the shaking camera. Security guards, managers, staff, and actors completely disguised with sunglasses and hats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were all W&amp;amp;U actors who knocked on the door to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panelists were making a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a hot video we just received. Their official return date was tomorrow, right? What do you think is the reason for the actors to secretly return early?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Of course, it's to avoid media attention. There were a lot of fans hoping the actors would make a glorious return after becoming world stars, but in the end, they ended up returning with embarrassing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen replayed the actors' backs. Their past interview clips and pictures appeared on the screen in the middle. The way the edited the picture of actors waving their hands as they left confidently and their current return felt almost malicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employees' gazes alternated between the TV and their phones as they murmured,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company was supposed to not tell anyone and have them return quietly, so how did they know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, wow. There are tons of articles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we expected the media to cause a commotion, they just can't wait to get their hands on it, can they?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I checked articles on my phone. Provocative headlines already messily filled the news column. There were two key phrases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despair of Entering Hollywood. Embarrassing Return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few W&amp;amp;U actors who tried to become world stars. There were only three who didn't fall off and held on. There were even actors who were considered at the top of the country amongst them. These were actors who made you think that they could work in the US with their skillset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the company poured money to promote them, they appeared on quite a few Hollywood works. They also poured tons of money into promotional activities in the country whenever a film or a drama pilot was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing on blockbusters with budgets of hundreds of millions of US dollars. Coordination with famous Hollywood actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the results were always below our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Entering Hollywood's market was W&amp;amp;U's internal project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-To be exact, it was CEO Baek Hansung's project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I heard that they poured an enormous amount of money in the US market, so this failure likely hurts a lot. What do you think they'll do from now on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-W&amp;amp;U's PR Team commented about how this was just them taking a breather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-That's just a public comment. I heard that their contract with a major Hollywood agency, which caused a lot of buzz when it was first announced, ended. I think it's fine to say that this is actually them pulling out from the US market?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It just shows how hard it is to get your foot in the door in Hollywood. How sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their words, the panelists were talking excitedly. They criticized CEO Baek Hansung's failure and negatively predicted actors' activity here having lost some of their fame in the country now. Reporters quickly proceeded to publish Asian actors who entered Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon was astonished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They went with the thoughts of starting with nothing and ended up suffering for it. Their futures will be tough. We did well by not going."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Joowon's interested in Hollywood though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Sung Uimin made a complicated expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't worry. Considering the situation, the company will probably put entering the US market on hold for a few years. Also, which actor doesn't want to become a world star? Heck, I want to too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You too?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, how about Songha?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon turned to ask me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Songha lived overseas so she's good at English. Is she not interested in Hollywood?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know. Songha never mentioned the US."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I recalled the future vision I saw a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future where Lee Songha filmed a secret audition tape. Apparently, a casting director put her on the audition list after learning about her through her role as an interpreter on Cat Guardian Ghost. They also said they didn't know what the title was, who was the director, and what role it was for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wondered if that might have been a Hollywood project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had yet to receive a secret audition proposal until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future had either yet to come or it completely disappeared through the butterfly effect of me changing the present. It was one of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, Chief Sung Uimin asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How about you, Team Leader Jung? Are you interested in Hollywood?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Hollywood, huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am interested, of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation between panelists entered my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Will failing to enter the US market affect W&amp;amp;U's domestic position?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-What's funny about that is, while W&amp;amp;U was wasting away in Hollywood, things have been going very well for them in the domestic and Chinese market. Their celebrities' albums or projects have done extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It was great. They've been on a streak since early this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Above all, Mr. Jung Sunwoo firmly building up his image as 'never failing' played a huge role. Any W&amp;amp;U fully took that image in. They've been on a roll domestically that we didn't notice their failure in the US. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-This, it seems that a lot hangs on Mr. Jung Sunwoo's next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My photo appeared on the screen for reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An employee ran up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Team 1 Leader and actors arrived below!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people around me murmured. The employee gulped before adding,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mood is really terrible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 211: To Reach for the Stars, or to Become One (3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elevator went up from the basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we passed the third floor, I heard people gulp around me. I thought that we would go directly to the CEO's office, but the elevator stopped on the fourth floor. And people poured in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Water! Someone get me some ice!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dokyung, get it together!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That moment, I wondered if I was in an ambulance instead of an elevator. Two managers held both arms of a woman who had collapsed like a corpse. They were pretty much dragging her in. Her disheveled, curly, red hair shook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let go of the bottle! Get it together!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll only be able to get it together once I drink some!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Dokyung shouted while holding the neck of a bottle. It was vodka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They definitely looked fine at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't only Lee Dokyung. The other actors were wrecks as well. Yoon Sangah was wailing while tears and snot ran down her face. Jang Yohan was puffing smoke with a pale face. Managers and staff were doing their best to comfort them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a mess. If someone saw this, they would this they were at a rehab center than an entertainment agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Dokyung, who finally lost her bottle of vodka, flailed about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Give it back! Give it back!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She fell on the floor and ended up just lying on it. She wasn't an actress. She was completely wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man in his early forties wearing a suit with no tie pushed others out the way as he approached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the Team 1 Leader, whom I had greeted only on occasion. He received the bottle of vodka from a manager and downed it instantly. Then he filled with ice water an employee brought over and handed it to Lee Dokyung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here. Now bring them up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Dokyung was dragged off by the managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, the Team 1 Leader snatched the cigarettes from Jang Yohan's lips and gestured with his chin. Another manager took Jang Yohan away. The only one left was Yoon Sangah. He approached the now sobbing Yoon Sangah. Taking a drag, he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop crying. It's not like we didn't expect the press's reactions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader, I-I can't breathe. Let me go to the washroom and calm down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon Sangah was brought downstairs by her manager. The lounge finally became quiet. Belatedly coming to their senses, employee rushed to greet the Team 1 Leader. He nodded while walking towards me. No, not to me, but the trashcan behind me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After throwing the cigarette butt in the trash, he said to the Team 3 Leader,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How have you been?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been fine here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Team 3 Leader evasively replied. The Team 3 Leader suddenly smiled before turning to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard about your news of your success, but I couldn't congratulate you. Shall we have drinks some time?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That'd be great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nodding, the Team 1 Leader went upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lounge was chaotic after the storm had passed. Everyone was busy trying to predict what was going on in the CEO's office. I went up to the fifth floor. The PR Team was on the battlefield. Team Leader Park and her employees were shouting into their phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went into my office and turned on my computer. The actors' names were all over the real-time search rankings. Especially Lee Dokyung. She was an actor who stood at the peak in the country before going to the US, so people's reactions were more heated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked like it'll be noisy for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was reading articles, my door suddenly burst open. This time, it was Chief Lee Bongjoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uh, I think you should go downstairs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did Team 1 go down?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only the actors. But Lee Dokyung, right now..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did she flop on the floor again?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, she got in a fight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a fight?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With who?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Son Chaeyoung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... What the heck was this all of a sudden?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She should be busy with drama shoots these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are downstairs?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lee Dokyung and her don't get along."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is there anyone Son Chaeyoung gets along with?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like very bad. Lee Dokyung flaunted a ton about how she was going to Hollywood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to imagine Lee Dokyung, who caused a fuss while holding a bottle of vodka, and Son Chaeyoung together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I gave up. It lowered my blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I went back down, there really was an incredible mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screw off! Did you come to mock me?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I came to watch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son Chaeyoung said while munching on donuts instead of popcorn. Her face was overflowing with vigor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was about to explode because of how tight the shooting schedule was, but seeing your face washed all my stress away. Do you even remember the last time you had a tight schedule?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey! I heard your drama flopped too! So you lost your commercials too!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I keep getting projects. Ah, do you want a minor role in my drama?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You crazy bitch, you keep-!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The managers tried to hold Lee Dokyung back as she tried to rush at Son Chaeyoung while wielding the vodka bottle. It was far from enough. The other employees retreated back like there was a contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon poked my side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shouldn't you stop Son Chaeyoung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You guys are close enough to exchange donuts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The acting Team 2 Leader will probably stop her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said, looking in the direction of the vending machines. Chief Jo Byunghwan, who was the acting team leader in place of the Team 2 Leader, was shouting at someone. Ah, it was Chief Lee Janghyun. He at least looked human when he went around looking for ripe persimmons, but now he was about to croak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company's already in turmoil. How could you bring Son Chaeyoung here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She went straight here after seeing the news on TV. How could I have stopped her?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? Stopping her is your job, bastard!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then fire me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Jo Byunghwan yelled while pointing at him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon, who was watching, clicked his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That team is becoming crazier every passing day. But Lee Janghyun, wasn't he lingering around, wanting to manage Songha? He's been quiet recently. I don't think he's the type to give up easily."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ah, I made a promise, so I let him fill in for me once."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said that Son Chaeyoung was better than Songha and left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon's expression turned odd. His lips opened as if to say something, but a grim voice sounded out from the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is it so noisy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 1 Leader came down from the stair landing. The murmuring employees shut their mouths. Son Chaeyoung and Lee Dokyung stopped what they were doing and looked over at him. The Team 1 Leader looked around the lounge as he asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where's Sangah?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chief No, who followed her, isn't picking up. We sent a road manager to look for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Team 1 employee, who I wasn't familiar with, replied. At the same time, someone added while stuttering,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uh, Yoon-Yoon Sangah's over there though?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His finger pointed to the TV. Everyone's gazes gathered there. The flat screen still played the entertainment gossip program. And Yoon Sangah was among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by reporters and holding onto an interview mic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Then you're saying that your agency pressured you into going to the US?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Yes, I personally thought it was too early to go to Hollywood, but the CEO and team leader were quite persistent. I couldn't refuse their proposal. I only did what they told me to do for the past few years in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh my god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scuffle between Son Chaeyoung and Lee Dokyung wasn't the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon Sangah was dropping bombs on live TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-And when you mentioned you were forced to act in a nude scene...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I received a casting offer for a new US cable channel TV show, and the role only had nude and sex scenes. I told them that I couldn't do it multiple times, but they said I had to if I wanted to raise my popularity...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miserable tears poured from Yoon Sangah's eyes. The camera zoomed in on her wet eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Then you must have a grudge on your agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Yes, it's because of them, that my life as an actor is ruined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon Sangah wailed again. Her cries echoed throughout the lounge. Everyone simply looked at the TV with dumbstruck expressions. The PR Team on the fifth floor screamed indecipherable swears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I guess she still thinks she's in Hollywood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 1 Leader said from behind. He frowned as he waved his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contact the legal team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, yes!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 1 employee quickly acted after receiving his orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 1 Leader disappeared into his office, and the employees, finally coming to their senses, caused an uproar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon blankly mumbled,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess we won't be able to hold a get-together today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I guess so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal and PR team acted quickly to settle the matter. They sent out articles explaining the situation. This wasn't an incident we wanted to drag on since Yoon Sangah's interview was quite far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The W&amp;amp;U denouncing public quickly turned their gaze at Yoon Sangah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, separate from the truth, W&amp;amp;U and Yoon Sangah continued to be mentioned in articles and by the public. W&amp;amp;U received a strong blow to their image after failing to enter the US market, while Yoon Sangah became known to have been afflicted with 'Hollywood' disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Yoon Sangah wanted to gain popularity through incidents like in Hollywood gossip girls, then she definitely succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, unlike Hollywood, one couldn't live off gossip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung and the Team 1 Leader wouldn't stop with just an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, while the company was busying putting out fires, things were progress quickly on my side. We continued auditioning for City Jungle, and my spot amongst judges constantly became newsworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were crazy days for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there was a day where my idle thoughts were completely washed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I saw Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon act in the basement, I became absorbed by it like I was on drugs. It was to the point where I forgot whether they were practicing or if it was real. Scenes that made me tense as I read them swallowed me whole when I watched them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally took a deep breath after seeing the last scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was already well into the night when I checked the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's stop here for today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I handed the two of them water and towels. Lee Songha ignored my hand and stood up. Her shoulders and back moved flexibly like an animal's beneath her sweat-soaked t-shirt. This was the result of the fitness trainer and martial artist director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to wash my face to recover."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said in a monotone voice before leaving the practice room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was something we experienced every time. It took a while before Lee Songha returned to her normal self after completely immersing herself in her role. She was like this for every project she worked on, but it seemed to take a particularly long time with City Jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amazing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon said while catching his breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Songha?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I could match her back during Alive, but I can't keep up with her this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing his head back, he covered his face with a towel. His shoulders and chest heaved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because he was on a strict diet to make the paper-weak figure of an artist, but his already impoverished and faint appearance grew even fainter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm worried that I will be too behind. I need to at least act the part of the lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No need to worry. You're doing great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then that's a relief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon said with a quiet laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still wonder why you picked me. Especially when I'm reading with Songha. I don't think I'll be able to act like her even if my life depended on it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I received some sort of revelation that Songha must act."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I saw the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And I was shocked for different reasons when I met you. You were totally my type."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon laughed at the joke at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also... you hold a special meaning to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mumbled before changing the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw a ton of actors while holding auditions, and there really were a lot of people who were great at acting. However, I didn't receive any revelation, like with Songha, nor was as shocked as when I saw you. I guess my preferences are high class."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, your preferences are what? What's high class?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha came back with water still dripping. She had come with hurried steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her immersed role was completely gone, and she was Lee Songha from head to toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, laughs warmed the practice room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fall was really short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter was even shorter. Spring seriously passed in a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, we were finally approaching summer again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 212: Management Business Division Team 4 Leader (1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;W&amp;amp;U Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cautious gazes glanced inside the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's not here today again. Maybe it isn't this team?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said it is Team 4. Maybe he's inside the team leader's office?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one's there. The door was closed all lunch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youths who looked to be in middle school or high school were gathered behind the stairs as they whispered to each other. They all had pretty faces, likely having heard compliments that they should be celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their consecutive success with Blackout and Neptune, the strategic planning team and the Management Team 3 decided to create a more robust in-house system and were holding auditions. These youths were trainees who made the final cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard that you're guaranteed to succeed if that team leader says so. It's true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard the same thing. Compliments! He has to compliment you. Song Inho oppa said in an interview that he blew up after the team leader told him he thought he'd do well!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, I saw him just once in the elevator, but I couldn't say hi because I was so scared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing over there?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trainees became flustered at the sudden question. Seeing the slender woman with her arms crossed, the trainees whispered, "PR Team Leader" to each other. Then they greeted her with loud voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who are you looking for here? Team 3 is downstairs?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's... We still aren't too familiar with the building."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young man wearing his school uniform, who seemed to be the oldest in the group, took the lead to make an excuse. The other trainees nodded quickly. Seeing this, Team Leader Park quietly asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe you came to see celebrities? Actors? They don't usually come here though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon? No, that's not it..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then did you come to see Team Leader Jung Sunwoo?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flinching, the trainees quickly lowered their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park giggled, understanding their reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then you've waited for nothing. Team Leader Jung's taking the rare break right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman with short hair like a boy touched the logo on the panel then continued walking. A mean undid his necktie and shoved it in his pocket before following her in a leisurely manner. They were walking up the stairs from W&amp;amp;U's basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard the competition was fierce since a lot of people applied to Team 4, but I guess we got the prize. To be honest, if it wasn't for getting into Team 4, I would have seriously considered whether to accept the offer or not. I applied here because of Team Leader Jung Sunwoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman glanced at him when he said that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why? Are you his fan?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My goal is to become a star manager. He's a good role model."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman burst out laughing when she saw him say that with a beaming smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side, they heard music and the shouts of a trainer. Saying that it might be Neptune, the man went over only to come back disappointed. They were trainees. Walking around the halls, they encountered other trainees. After walking past the recording and production studios, they finally saw the offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man spoke in a quiet voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company is huge, but there aren't a lot of people here. Do they have flexible work arrangements?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are probably working away from the office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see many celebrities either."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They looked around the lounge and the outdoor smoking area with a garden before entering the office with the 'Team 4' panel on it. There were more empty chairs than occupied ones. Only a few employees were on their phones or computers working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two of them greeted the employees before looking around the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it wasn't for the schedule board, posters of affiliated celebrities' works, pictures of celebrities holding their film and TV awards, and stacks of Pretty Girls and Neptune's albums, one would think this was just a normal office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems this is Team 4's lineup for the second half of the year?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man murmured as he looked at the ownerless desk. The planner filled for 12 months had fully organized the overwhelming schedule for the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day Seo Jijoon's Korean-Chinese-Japanese joint film would be done filming, the broadcasting schedule of Song Inho's PBS drama and the release date of his independent film, and the day Im Joowon starts filming. The man examined these schedules before lowering his voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, City Jungle!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placing his finger on the planner, the man's eyes shined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project had finished filming and was now in the finishing stages of production. It initially became a hot topic due to Jung Sunwoo, Lee Songha, and the crowdfunding announcement. Now, even after half a year had passed, it was still newsworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of entertainment reporters are chattering about this. Will Midas's Hand work again or not. Although there are other projects by other actors in Team 4, they only focus on City Jungle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because people are curious about the results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a lot of people who are waiting for it to be released. Additionally, many are talking about how much they are going to invest. Some who are interested in the drama are hoping it completely flops..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chatting man suddenly straightened his back. Then he bowed like a new recruit. The woman also bowed her head in greeting. Lee Kwanwoo, who they had met once before, was walking into the office. The once known romanticist of W&amp;amp;U, his face looked much more irritated from being overworked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you have a look around? How is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's still a little awkward since it's my first day to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Kwanwoo's drooped eyes narrowed at the man's sociable response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, I went around on set on my first day so I had no opportunity to be awkward. I even remember seeing a thorny path with a devil playing his bugle to welcome me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His calm recollection made the new recruits flinch their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Team Leader Jung said that he came to work at 3 am and immediately went to Neptune's music broadcast schedule."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah! I read that in an article. He was able to meet Knet's Producer Go Joontae and get Neptune on Next K-Star that day. While reading the article, my heart raced so much that I wanted to rush on to the scene."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then shall we go?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Kwanwoo made a strange smile before taking the lead. The two new managers quickly followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After they disappeared, the employees, who had seemingly been concentrating on their work, simultaneously raised their heads like meercats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One month for the guy, and three months for the girl."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I give that guy a week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You really don't think he'll even last a week? When his heart raced?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether his heart raced or exploded, we need to see how he works. You know the road manager that was recently hired into Team 2? He seemed pretty good, but he sent a message saying that he was quitting after two days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That team's a bit rougher than ours. Compared to them, our team is quite harmonious. The celebrities we are managing are easily to manage for their level in general. Also, working with Team Leader Jung is..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office became quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My phone vibrated. After checking the contents, I placed my phone back in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must have rained last night as the wind was moist. I filled a worn bowl with feed and opened the lock to the chicken coop. The chicken coop my father and brother made over the weekend did seem quite legit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I stepped in, the chickens caused a ruckus. I remember my father started raising three or four chicks, but they reproduced so fast that there were around twenty large chickens. I did hear that my father would go in any time, whether it was day and night, to feed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this rate, it'll become a chicken farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was filling their food trough, Gyeoul&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;, who was refilling their water tank, said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uncle, there's a girl named Lee Seolin in my class. Her dream is becoming a girl group idol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She auditioned to become a W&amp;amp;U trainee this time, but she was contacted that she was rejected at the first stage. She came over to me crying, asking me to talk to you. So, about that, can you call her once?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, my god. I didn't think that I would receive audition requests from my own niece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at her round, earnest eyes before saying,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gyeoul, life is..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't you tell her to stop dreaming?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's really mean. Not long ago, she was bullying my friends, and now, she clings to me, telling me that she's going to become a girl group idol. Hah, so annoying. Can't you tell her to stop dreaming, wash her feet and sleep? Huh? Please?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She grumbled while brushing her short hair over her ear. It seemed like it was only yesterday when she was childish and immature, but when did she start talking about screwing others over with such finesse? This was a great stride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I stared at her in a new light, she blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you looking at me like that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just thinking that you've grown. It seems you all can have 1 chicken each."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, that's life. You're thirty this year. Dozen eggs!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said as she giggled, holding eggs hens had laid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty. Ah, that's right. I'll be thirty this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt a bit off earlier this year, but I had completely forgotten about this with all the work I had to deal with. It wasn't like there was a big difference between twenty-nine and thirty besides the first digit changing. Looking back, I simply felt like I lived a busy life in my late twenties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's bird poop on the eggs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eww!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gyeoul quickly passed the eggs to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uncle! Uncle! We caught worms!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eww, so gross! But they're huge! Oh, but so gross!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining quadruplets rushed over. They must have dug up the worms in the wet mud as their clothes were caked in it. Kaeul was carrying a bowl of worms in front of him. I thought they would only have two or three, but it was wriggling with them. They deserved to be proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where did you catch so many of them?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The plum grove over there! Grandpa told us where we could catch a lot of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eww, catching them was so gross!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why were you catching them when they are so gross?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To give to the chicks! It's nutritious. They are pitiful for only eating feed all the time!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know about that. I didn't think they really need any more nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quadruplets entered the area specially fenced out for the chicks in the chicken coop before dropping the bowl of worms. Having discovered the special meal, the almost fully-grown chickens rushed out with their beaks pointed. The quadruplets screamed as they rushed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uncle! What the heck are they? Where are the chicks?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are the chicks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They aren't chicks, they're chickens! They fit in the palm of my hand when I saw them last month?! Their feathers were soft and warm. They were real chicks!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They grew that big after eating feed all day. Pitifully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Grandma said that they were still babies!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, she was lying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was getting hard to fool them as they developed, but they were completely tricked this time. Seeing their devastated faces, like they had seen their country fall, I laughed. It felt like all my built-up stress was being washed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a few eggs and returned home. They were already chatting and having a laugh at how the quadruplets were fooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had chicken noodle soup for lunch.&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt; We also had fried some eggs to make it a meal. I bit into some ripe plums for dessert. Their sour juice spread in my mouth. With the fan blowing at me while I ate plums, this was heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother poked a piece of plum with her fork as she mumbled,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How long has it been since we gathered like this besides holidays?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We came quite often. It's just hard to see Sunwoo's face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sunwoo, are you eating well? Don't skip meals. Make sure you're eating. You need to take care of yourself at your age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thirty is still considered young these days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Actual young folks don't say that. The plums at the back are tasty, do you want to take a few boxes home? Your brother already ate two boxes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We cleared them as soon as we opened them. I keep craving sour things these days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone became quiet at my sister-in-law's words. Scared eyes glanced at her flat stomach, and they finally became relieved when she waved her hands in denial and laughed. After becoming pregnant with quadruplets, pregnancies were a sensitive subject in our family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sunwoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father avoided the piece of plum my mother gave him as he spoke,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When are you going back?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should be going soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother joined in,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When will you come back once you leave today? You're coming for Thanksgiving, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yup, I'll try to take as much time off as I can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop pestering him and let him be. His work is important, especially now that he's a team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother sulked at my father's words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And is family not important? I can't even see my son besides on holidays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go to the chicken coop and see how big the chicks have gotten. Just think of them as family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother wielded her fork once more. The piece of plum eventually made it into my father's mouth. Seeing my father scrunch up from the sourness, I suddenly remembered what my brother told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That our father has been lonely since recovering his health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also why he began growing chicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll visit often."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I said this while looking at my parents, my father coughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then tell us before you come. I'll grab a chicken and cook chicken soup.&lt;sup&gt;{3}&lt;/sup&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to cook them even though you said to think of them as family? It looks like you still care about your son more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother snorted. My brother and sister-in-law laughed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I leisurely leaned against the sofa. I looked at my family gathered around me and the quadruplets watching an entertainment show on TV before staring at the slow, tranquil countryside outside the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My break was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I entered the grey building in Cheongdam-dong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having returned to work after a few days, it was still busy as ever and filled with life. My heart began to beat faster. My belly grew hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader, the City Jungle marketing agency wants a meeting with you!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company in charge of handling the crowdfunding is also causing a fuss, asking a ton of questions...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Joowon! They say his film shoots are going to be delayed in China! He has a commercial shoot immediately though. They're saying that they can't delay either, so what should we do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My employees rushed over and reported as though they had been waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is there such a fuss as soon as I arrive?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uh, can I add to that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone came over. It was Chief Lee Bongjoon, who had been going to and from China and Japan these days. While greeting him, I placed my bag on my desk when another employee rushed in while holding his phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader, there's trouble on set and they are looking for you! The road manager says he can't take it any longer!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Again?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employee nodded. Chief Lee Bongjoon chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Son Chaeyoung? She's the same as ever, huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, it's Songha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employee replied with a sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken aback, Chief Lee Bongjoon blinked his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lee Songha? What about her?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Just a reminder - Bom, Yeoleum, Kaeul, and Gyeoul are the names of Jung Sunwoo's quadruplet nephews and nieces. They are also the seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt; Not the Western version - 닭국수&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{3}&lt;/sup&gt; Similar to 닭국수 without the noodles - 백숙&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:32:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 209</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78583/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 209: To Reach for the Stars, or to Become One (1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Hey, we had a serious discussion while eating live octopuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Taewoong's voice sounded out from the audio speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed my friends were hanging out as it was noisy in the background. I unconsciously frowned. Has there ever been a good result from their discussions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-That, crowdfunding thing. We decided to invest a lot in it. Friends need to help each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to help, just watch the film. Did you watch Alive?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-There's no need to feel any burden. Although we promised never to exchange money between each other, the situation this time's a little special. We decided to consider like giving you your wedding gift and invest five thousand won each.&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Friends need to help each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why I said, if you want to help- How much?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Five thousand won each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hung up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin, the casting director, grinned from the passenger's seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are quite a few people like that around me too. People interested in crowdfunding City Jungle. There were a lot of people who bet on whether your next project would be a success or not for fun, and now it seems like you set up the playing field for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin loosened his tie as he looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There must be more around you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family members, relatives, and even people beyond that were curious. There were a few people who asked me to tell them how the film was after the shoot or how people reacted to internal screenings. It felt like I was on a gambling table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aren't there too many people here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin said in astonishment as he looked out past the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd was so large that you might think we were at a flea market on a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will you be okay? A lot of people might recognize you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've come prepared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put a thick, clunky pair of glasses and a hat over my naturally tangled hair. My face reflected in the rear-view mirror looked slightly different. When I got out holding a light jacket, Chief Lee Kyojin, who got out before me, raised his brows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's it? It's a bit weak considering you've come prepared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have one more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I replied as I put the green jacket on like a cloak. Chief Lee Kyojin burst laughing after seeing a university's name in big letters on the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know which department's jacket that is, but it's quite intense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a prop for a drama. A stylist brought it over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disguised as a university student, I entered the flea market with steadfast steps. People had laid out mats from the park to the road, and people buying and selling were noisily mixed together. The scene was full of vigor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The face I was looking for was in a place with easels and portrait paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A painter, who gave off a heart-warming feeling, and a spot between his clients were particularly still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stop. Don't move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The painter said in a low voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child sitting in front of him straightened his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mister, when will it be done?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Endure for a bit longer. I'm trying to an especially good job for you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents pacified the grumbling child. They waited expectantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The painter painting the child's portrait gave off a different mood. Unlike his colleagues, who wore simple t-shirts, he wore a dress shirt on and a professional apron with its strings tied tightly around his waist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His black hair looked soft, and he wore a lightly faded pair of glasses and a black face mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His expression was somewhat gloomy, and his actions were delicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ahh..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin admired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young painter's gaze alternated between the paper and the child's face before his hand started moving again. As mood elevated to where it seemed like a masterpiece was about to be unveiled, passersby stopped in their tracks and tilted their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey, doesn't that painter look like he has a story?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? Just admit he's handsome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think he's good at painting too. Let's go get our portrait too. How much is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Three thousand... Huh? Only he's doing it for free. Why is he drawing for free?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're right. Is he just volunteering?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two women stood in line as they tilted their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, the painter put down his pencil. The child was hopping in his seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mister, is it done yet?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's done, but I don't like it very much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please show me!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child's small hand snatched the paper away. The moment the child looked at the painting he had held his breath in expectations for, he flinched. Even his parents, who were happily watching, flinched. The women who were waiting in line also glanced at it and flinched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a portrait. It was an abstract painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides there being a mouth, nose, and eyes on a face, there was nothing similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Mister, what is this? Did you paint this with your feet?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I painted it with my hands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is this me? Do I look like this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told you it wasn't good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know it would be this bad!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irritated child looked at other painters' works beside him and shouted,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other misters and sisters are drawing really well! Why is yours like this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man wearing a baseball cap behind the painter cut in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The painting's like that because it's free. If you want a better portrait, go next door, pay three thousand won, and ask them to draw it again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trash!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even while grumbling, the child took the portrait and left. Of course, the women who were waiting in line also left. The painters next to them laughed like he caught another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How are you planning to live off your paintings if your skills are this bad?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My friend's works are always a bit peculiar... Team leader?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup recognized me and got to his feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the street painter, Nam Joyoon, smiled with a welcome face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How are you? There are more people than expected. Is everything okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon nodded. Kim Hyunsup replied for him,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's in disguise. He's wearing glasses and a mask, and his hair his unkempt, so no one can recognize him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There isn't anyone who recognize me even with my glasses off though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's just say it's because you're in disguise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup patted Nam Joyoon's shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watched Nam Joyoon pack his things and asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You really looked like a painter when I was watching you. How is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've become used to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's gotten used to being cursed at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup joined in again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't you just watch and imitate painters? Do you really have to give people, who came to have good memories, your paintings?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's better than drawing then not giving them it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I introduced them to Chief Lee Kyojin as they got up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He examined Nam Joyoon since the moment he saw him and was still looking at him after I got painters coffee from a nearby coffee truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I suggested a few actors for the role Mr. Nam Joyoon played in Alive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin said while licking his lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Minor role actors, stage actors, musical actors, and even aspiring actors attending acting school. I showed Director Choi Sungwon hundreds of people, but he rejected them all after seeing them audition. That was why I honestly thought Team Leader Jung pulled some strings when I heard you got cast. I was wondering how well you'd do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His gaze looked at me and Nam Joyoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You were really great. I was convinced as soon as I saw."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah... Thank you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chief Lee Kyojin's eyes curved like willow trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought that you'd be quite good for the artist with a 'distorted sense of aesthetics' after reading City Jungle's scenario, but it's much better seeing you in person. I feel pumped to cast supporting roles since you fit so well as the lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you already reserve tickets?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What did you come to see? If you buy tickets now, we'll give you a 20% discount!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting part-timers handed out pamphlets. They looked at me, Chief Lee Kyojin, Nam Joyoon, and Kim Hyunsup before clinging to Kim Hyunsup, who looked like the easiest target. Chief Lee Kyojin waved his hand like he was chasing flies away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already reserved our tickets, and we are on our way to see it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time we arrived at the small theatre, our hands were full of promotional posters for plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup was astonished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's so crazy here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is after they started cracking down on illegal promoters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin shrugged. We passed the ticket booth and went down to the first basement floor. The walls were filled with pink posters. At the very bottom of the casting board, we saw pictures of the actors appearing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's this fellow here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin pointed to the middle of the casting board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company employee role. Park Hyejae. He was the reason why we came all the way here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin and I went through hundreds of profile picture for one of the important supporting roles, the hitman. Park Hyejae was an actor suggested by an agency manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His long eyes didn't have double-eyelids gave off quite the impression. He's been doing plays for eight years or so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish his acting was good too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The manager who suggested him said it was really good, but we need to see for ourselves. If we simply believe whatever they say, all their suggestions are prettier than Lee Songha and better at acting than Park Hyeseung&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went up to our designated seats. People's gazes focused on us when we all sat down in a line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup lowered his baseball cap visor as he asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was there a need for all four of us to come here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The role has a lot of scenes with the lead. The image becomes clearer if I see them both together, so it'll be helpful. There are also cases where actors don't work well together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then it would have been great if Ms. Lee Songha came along as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Songha will stand out no matter where she goes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup returned to his seat with a bitter expression at my words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it'll be less eye-catching than four guys sitting together like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people who filled the seats were couples. Or two women. With four guys sitting in a row amongst them really was a strange sight. Also, the group was too awkward to be considered friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup grumbled,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How about we sit in pairs?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that'll look stranger?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then let's act like theatre employees on business than to enjoy ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin took out City Jungle's scenario. Kim Hyunsup also took out a scenario from a bag containing his painting tools. Nam Joyoon didn't care about other people's gazes and his gaze was fixed on the stage after getting ready to watch the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin flipped over a page filled with memos as he admired,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt this while reading it, but the details are really good. I read a lot of crime/action scenarios, but the dialogue in this one seems particularly realistic. It seems the director did a lot of research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From what I heard,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought up what Forest's CEO told me in the past,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Oh Hyunkyung actually borrowed money from a loan shark and didn't pay it back for two or three months back when she was editing the scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To see their reaction. This is a scenario made with blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are other things to try on your own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunsup looked frightened. Chief Lee Kyojin made a stiff smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The director seems to have risked her life on this project then. Someone like her is also critical of actors. You should prepare yourself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we were chatting, the lights turned off and the play began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was my first play in a long time, so I got completely absorbed in it. The screenplay was quite good, and the actors' acting skills were very good. There wasn't a single familiar face. I guess there really were a lot of unknown talented actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Hyejae shined amongst them. Of course, he didn't shine in only my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no need to discuss. Park Hyejae and the other actors came out after the play ended. The actors murmured to each other after discovering us. I heard them mention autographs, fans, and pens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Kyojin skillfully took out his business card and approached them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Park Hyejae?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, what is..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am a casting director. Would you like to audition for a movie?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their murmurs grew louder. Park Hyejae took Chief Lee Kyojin's business card. The other actors stuck closer and looked at it with doubtful eyes. It was normal for them to be wary. There were too many scammers in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as I was wondering if it would be good for Nam Joyoon to take off his mask, the actress who played the female lead widened her eyes when she saw me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Koreans give money at weddings. Here, his friends are saying they'd give him ~$5 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt; I don't think this person has ever been mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:32:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 207-208</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78582/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 207: Once You Start Being Swayed (5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer hung up and approached us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, can you open up some time? Our CEO is currently talking with Well-Made Pictures about investments and distribution, and they said that they would like to discuss it with you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well-Made Pictures?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wilting Forest's CEO was the first to perk up. Well-Made Pictures was one of the top investment distribution companies in the country. They were also the main investment distribution company for Alive as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I readily replied,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Made Picture's building was in the middle of Gangnam. SBE Film's CEO, who had arrived ahead of us, was sitting in a large meeting room by himself. With his arms crossed and head down, he gave off a gloomy mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is your expression like that? I think we can consider this is a green light if they want to talk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's CEO's eyes shot up at the project producer's question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, back with Alive, we received a call an hour and a half after sending them the scenario. That their investment screening committee unanimously decided to invest. That is a green light."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation is different though. Alive was Director Choi Sungwon's work, and we had Lee Kihwan and Park Saeryung already cast. City Jungle is..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembering Director Oh Hyunkyung and I were present, the chatting project producer changed the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyways, we need to try hard to persuade them. It's not like they are going to slam the door in our faces after making a lot of money with Alive, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as he sat down, the project producer asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director, CEO, what is the budget you thought about for City Jungle?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The budget?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You probably crunched the numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung and Forest's CEO exchanged looks. Soon, Director Oh Hyunkyung answered as though she was applying for a loan,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"3-2.5 billion won."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"2.5 billion won?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer couldn't help but laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I read your scenario, and I don't think 2.5 billion is anywhere near enough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can trim down the number of shoots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you're going to jump straight into the deep end? If you set your budget too low and we exceed it later, we'll need to cling to the investor's legs and beg for more. Just say what the initial budget you calculated was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... If possible, 3.5 billion won."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung cautiously raised the amount. The project producer scratched his chin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to them discussing financial matters while drinking the coffee an employee got me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.5 billion won at most. It fell short of the average commercial film budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this was because my first film was Alive, whose total production budget was over 30 billion won. Such blockbusters were rare. If I lowered my standards, there were many more films that were created below budget due to lack of funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excuse me..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest's CEO cautiously spoke,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What if we tried talking to Director Hwang from Ant Capital?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The person who mocked us by telling us to do whatever we want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Still, we were in talks for a 50 billion won investment..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer firmly shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't hold onto broken relationships. Also, Ant Capital wouldn't have given you all 50 billion won. Their methods are a bit malicious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They come in as the main investor and act like they are going to invest the full amount, but they'll drop the amount when it comes time to sign the contract. That way, they hold influence and can sway you however they want. The production company and director have to film with the budget with tears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest's CEO's mouth was agape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we had prints and advertising to the 3.5-billion budget, let's go with 5 billion as the total budget. While it's normal to have 30-40% of it from investment distribution company and 60-70% from partial investors, we should be able to make up the difference with partial investors if we get Well-Made Pictures..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He swallowed his words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man wearing a vintage pair of glasses pushed the door open with his shoulder and came in. He was the general manager of the Korean Film Production Department at Well-Made Pictures. I had seen him at the Alive press distribution screening. He had a notebook, files, and a copy of City Jungle in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's CEO immediately asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How was the meeting?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO, let's sit before we discuss things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, please sit. How was the meeting?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a hasty exchange of hands. Holding my hand last, the general manager asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you have any thoughts on changing the lead?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is that the result of the meeting?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general manager looked at the everyone before looking back at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were many comments about the director and scenario, but more people are against the male lead than anything else. With Ms. Lee Songha as the lead and SBE Film producing, investors will invest if the level of the male lead was increased. Perhaps other male actors from W&amp;amp;U..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already handed him the scenario, and the actor agreed to do it. We can't overturn this and hand the role over to another actor in the company. We have never done it nor have we ever been asked to consider it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood became strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had never been treated like a piddling manager since Neptune was no longer considered a 'washed up' idol group and Lee Songha became an international star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this was expected in this place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wasn't a team leader at W&amp;amp;U and didn't have other actors in my care. If I was only the manager to Nam Joyoon, they wouldn't have been suggested his. All I would have been able to do is wait endlessly for the meeting results. I might not have even been informed that the male lead had been changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should leave a bitter taste in my mouth, but a smile crept up my lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fervor surged within me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fervor to make the film a success and change people's opinions on Nam Joyoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This, this is a scenario Director Choi Sungwon read and said was good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's CEO said while tapping on the City Jungle scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I told him the male lead, the artist, was Mr. Nam Joyoon, he said that there was a role he wanted Mr. Nam Joyoon to play in his upcoming work and that he needed to get a verbal agreement before Mr. Nam Joyoon's fame skyrockets with City Jungle's success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here I thought SBE Film had agreed faster than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should thank Director Choi Sungwon later. And make a verbal agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Is that so?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Well-Made general manager scratched his cheek. SBE Film's CEO continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a blockbuster needing tens of billions of won. The total budget for this is 5 billion won. It's not that big of a burden. You already have a space to fill in next year's lineup after Director Park Hyungil's work fell through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ace and AK Entertainment's lineups seem to be made up of similar works. Isn't Well-Made's motto 'variety'? It'll be good to have a polished action noir flick in your lineup. Let's invest a small amount into its potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's CEO slowly talked Well-Made's general manager into it. Director Oh Hyunkyung was firm that she wanted Nam Joyoon as the male lead. Soon, Well-Made's general manager said in a half-convinced face,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if we do invest, it won't be a lot. Everyone's clamoring for more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to continue looking at venture capitals and financial companies. With Ms. Lee Songha as the star."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer glanced at me and continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, since Team Leader Jung Sunwoo said he would actively help out, there'll definitely be more people enticed by this opportunity. We were able to easily promote Alive thanks to Team Leader Jung. He's more a hot topic now than he was..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Made's general manager abruptly cut in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard this in the meeting just now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That Team Leader Jung Sunwoo developed a panic disorder due to the burden of picking his next project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I barely managed to hold onto my coffee cup. Other people's gazes turned odd as they looked at me. That rumor was like a cockroach. How was it spreading outside when we finally managed to quell it internally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who told you that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's spreading amongst directors and production companies? Discussions about Team Leader Jung Sunwoo are of highest interest in this industry. I heard that Director Cha Jaeho, in particular, has said it on multiple private occasions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The one who's working on Supernatural right now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I heard Director Cha worked hard to get Ms. Lee Songha. It seems he was upset after being rejected. I think he's been saying how it was no wonder your sense of judgment fell after he heard you had a panic disorder. Having rejected the male lead, Mr. Heo Kakyung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fellows...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those are all false rumors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's what I thought. The problem is, no matter how big or small it is, a false rumor..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Made's general manager clicked his tongue,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will have an effect on investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Well-Made Pictures was reviewing the investment, I attended multiple meetings SBE Film arranged. There were many who outright refused after seeing that the project had an unknown director and a supporting role male lead, but there were also some who were interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, whether it was as a joke or not, the investors always brought up the panic disorder rumor. It seems that the fact I chose City Jungle over other great works, including Supernatural, gave credibility to the rumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was to the point where I wondered if I should carry around a doctor's note saying I was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I even had reporters contact me about it. While the rumor didn't spread in the media thanks to the PR Team, this still resulted in a small wrench in my plans of using my title as 'Midas's Hand' to bring in investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While City Jungle's production issues were being handled...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got on track to handle other actor's next projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because I had a change of heart, but I no longer saw other projects as flops. I sent the scenarios and scripts I reviewed and selected with chiefs to each actor. Then I asked for their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Jijoon was first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw that scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Jijoon suddenly said as he walked into the meeting room with Chief Lee Bongjoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Which one?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"City Jungle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I unconsciously flinched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scenario was fun. So about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Jijoon slowly rubbed his lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was thinking about investing in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I relaxed my shoulders. My heart belatedly started to race. In that short moment, I had thought about 20 different ways to handle the situation if he said he was interested in the male lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not interested in appearing on it since I've done a lot of serious roles. I'm currently interested in works that I can act with a smile, but I was thinking about investing because the scenario is fun. I heard other actors do this when they see good projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... How much are you thinking of?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not a lot. Maybe 500 million won?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How much?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"500 million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's an excessive amount. You might not even get your money back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then well, I guess I was wrong about the scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He replied with a light laugh. Chief Lee Bongjoon simply shook his head at the side like he couldn't deal with him. I decided to talk to SBE Film about Seo Jijoon's interest in investing and brought the conversation to his next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Jijoon's eyes, which shined at the prospect of investing, dimmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There aren't any I really feel like I want to act in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You didn't even give the scripts a close look!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon glared at him. Seo Jijoon, who feigned ignorance, let out a sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader. I wasn't able to say this when the Team 2 Leader was around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't worry and you can tell me"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I worked like a dog until now. I was thinking that maybe I could take longer breaks between projects..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes of the two people in front of me bulged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the flustered Chief Lee Bongjoon could open his mouth, Seo Jijoon brightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I think it'll be good if you go do your mandatory military service while taking a break."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I said that, Seo Jijoon got up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, I have to go do mandatory service. I'm thinking about going after one more project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And not take a break?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I need to work like a dog when I can, why would I take a break? Let's go take a look at those scripts, hyung!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon chuckled as he was dragged out by Seo Jijoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next was Im Joowon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as he entered the meeting room, he took off his shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader, look at this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... At what?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do you think?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure what you want me to say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to his stomach. His face looked so uncontrollably happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a six pack! I worked so hard at the gym to make this!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, it does seem like you have one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also seemed like you don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I looked beside him, Chief Sung Uimin was smiling with a Buddha's face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know the work drawn up by IBC? The one with Bok Seoin as the male lead. He wants to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Why that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't one of the projects we looked favorably on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened to the scenarios and scripts we gave him and why did he settle on this on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He obstinately says he wants to do that one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave me a look, asking me to persuade him because he couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Joowon was still bragging about his flat belly. He was so jealous whenever Yoon Taekyung took his shirt off for a scene during Royal Family. First, I got Im Joowon to put his shirt back on and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with that role isn't your body though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, his body was the biggest problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lee Boyeon is the female lead. I don't think there'll be any chemistry with you two as love interests because you look so young. Rather than showing off your manly side, it might have a negative effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'll probably look like an aunt and nephew."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't that bad, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Sung Uimin dragged Im Joowon, who was intently looking at the mirror, off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho was last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He came with the independent film director, who was again doing reshoots and additional shoots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bearded directors entered the room like he was entering a tiger's den.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you feeling unwell?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, that is. Last time I came here, Chief Jo Byunghwan said that they wanted to cancel Song Inho's contract and were willing to pay the fee. I've been avoiding him since then. I don't even come near W&amp;amp;U anymore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's fine now, director. Those days have passed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho held the director's arm while smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking my expression, the director cautiously said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been people wanting to invest now that Inho's fame skyrocketed. I would like to shoot scenes we had to skip due to budget restraints, so if you could free up Inho's schedule a few times..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It might become a posthumous work at this rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director was shocked as though he felt his life was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho spoke as if trying to calm his worries,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a joke. Hyung, no, the team leader is a bit of a mischievous joker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a joke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Hyung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Up until that was all a joke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I added with a laugh. Only now did the mood relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All you need to do is adjust when it overlaps with other schedules. We're reviewing a few dramas, but as a rookie, there'll probably be many days where he has to wait day and night on set."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course. We can definitely...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concern in the director's face was washed away. After those two left with faces like they were about to play pattycake, I organized my thoughts in the meeting room. I twirled the pen in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the second meeting with Well-Made Pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general manager, who had been slowly been thinking over this, finally nodded his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We decided to invest in the film's potential with a small investment. We will invest 20% of your budget. There are many employees who are against this still, so we couldn't take out a lot of money. Let's fill the remaining 80% with partial investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are working hard to gather the funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer replied as he relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I silently listened to them before saying,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did think about the matter of investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their gazes gathered on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How about we ask the public to invest through crowdfunding?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 208: Once You Start Being Swayed (6)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crowdfunding?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer scratched beneath his ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know. There's a limit to the amount of money you can gather through crowdfunding. It's also used a lot for charity or sponsorships than investments. It may be useful for an independent or a low budget film, but it probably won't be of much use for our film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of blockbusters do it these days though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's more for marketing than investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, for marketing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their expressions became strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I laid out the plain I had organized in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We set a small target amount for funding. Although we say that it's investing in the film, it's simply giving the public an interesting event to participate in. We increased the public's interest in Pretty Girls' album with the production of Making Film, and it was received quite well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wasn't 'quite'. It was great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer said in astonishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will also increase the public's interest. There are tons of people who are interested in whether the project I'm set on will be a success or a flop. Whether it's a thousand or ten thousand won, once the audience's money comes in as an investment, even more people will be interested in the result. Of course, it'll help with marketing the film as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... It'll probably be incomparably more helpful than an interview."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the general public's interest surges, there will also be venture capitals that'll decide to belatedly invest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We might even receive too much and be unable to accept any more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the public will be more interested the more I take part in the production of the film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason people used top stars as leads was, in the end, to increase public interest. Unlike drama that air whenever you turn on the TV, films put more burden on the audience as they had to physically go to the theatres to watch it. That was why companies spent billions of won making posters and promoting the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A power to bring people to the theatres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Nam Joyoon lacked ticket-selling power, then I simply had to make up the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, are you saying that you'll participate in full force?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not unexpected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, but what if..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer hesitated. Well-Made's general manager picked up after him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This film might be a complete flop. If the crowdfunding participants and partial investors cannot get a return on their investments, the image you built up will worsen drastically. It could also destroy your 'Midas's Hand' title."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I nodded candidly. The project producer asked with a flustered expression,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you certain that we'll at least breakeven?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't say that I'm 100% certain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or to be exact, I personally decided to step on the uncertain path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then why do you want to take on more risk?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This film. I want to make it a success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a path of uncertainty, but for some reason, I began to be certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the lukewarm certainty that it wouldn't be a complete flop even if it wasn't as big as a success as the version I saw in my visions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie City Jungle, in which Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon starred in, directed by Director Oh Hyunkyung, produced by Forest and SBE Film, invested by investors who took a risk in its low possibility of success, and distributed by Well-Made Pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The certainty that this film would be a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I began to become certain that I can make this film into a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer and Well-Made's general manager's eyes darted back and forth. They seemed to be calculating how to use me, the promotional item, as effectively as possible. Their pens quickly scribbled on their notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, I brought up another condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, if things progress like this, I need to receive something in return."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, if there's something you want, then please say it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Made's general manager said with a face of a salesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I leisurely said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First, regarding the actors' contract fee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fee. That makes me nervous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Made's general manager laughed jokingly. As he said, his face became tense. Was he worried I would ask for an absurd amount? Of course, I wasn't planning on taking out a huge chunk of our insufficient production budget. Only...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope we could sign with running guarantee than a full contract."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A running guarantee?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, in a way where they get additional money when after the film breaks even."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was similar to how investors split their shares. It would be a useless contract if the film didn't break even, but they would gradually accumulate money once the film broke even and began making profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think our side will be more motivated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At my words, Well-Made's general manager and project producer exchanged looks before nodding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't a hard condition. Let's go with that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's great that you're quick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corners of my lips rose as I continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And another..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{'Midas's Hand' Jung Sunwoo, who has had no failures, his next project City Jungle, what kind of film is it?}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{W&amp;amp;Y's 'Jung Sunwoo's Team' Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon confirmed for film City Jungle.}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Director Oh Hyunkyung, the director Midas's Hand teamed up with for City Jungle, will she able to break the prejudice against 'Unknown' and 'Female' Directors?}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bait we sent as a press release instantly spread like wildfire. Because Pretty Girls and Neptune's new songs were still at the top of the charts and were appearing on TV and stages, nothing else had to be done for City Jungle and my name to hit the real-time search rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We sent out short details about City Jungle and crowdfunding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set the period for crowdfunding after the film has been shot. That was when we need to put our efforts into promoting the film. The small funding target will be reached quickly, so if we started it too early, people might have already forgotten about the crowdfunding event by the time the movie releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the public's interests were peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Oh, my god. A director I've never heard of and Nam Joyoon as the lead? This is a real gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-According to someone from Chungmuro, that scenario has been rolling around with any investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Trash journalists predicted that Jung Sunwoo's next project would be a safe blockbuster, but Jung Sunwoo's completely doing things his way LOL 'Move, I'm going down my own path'/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-How will this funding work? Maybe I should put all the money I spend on the lottery and put it in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-You should only invest a small amount and consider it gone when investing in films. Return rates are a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-A guy I know's a director, and apparently, there are bad rumors about Jung Sunwoo these days. They're out of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just online. People I met were all eager to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I received as many questions as lead actors at a VIP Film Festival I was invited to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, is City Jungle's scenario really that good?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should we send some of our rookies for supporting role auditions?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait, wait. Did you also invest your own money into the film?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority seemed interested and supported the film, but there also many who whispered about how it was a foolish decision. That I would have been better off picking a relatively safer project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, there were also people who mocked me in my face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here I was wondering which great director you would work with after rejecting me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho, who I encountered in front of the washroom, snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Oh Hyunkyung? Who's that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's the director of City Jungle of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are differences between directors. Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, you really work foolishly. I heard you've developed a panic disorder while picking your next project. The female lead role you rejected, we cast Han Seoyeon instead. I think she's much better than Lee Songha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fellow was making blunt remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho smirked as he patted my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should come watch my film when it releases. I'll send you a screening ticket. You need to see what you missed so that you don't make the same mistake again. Ah, if the film flops after all this media hubbub, there might be no next time. CEO Baek Hansung's cold-hearted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While leisurely walking past me, he added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"City Jungle or whatever. I'll pay my own money and watch it. That's the least I can do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho looked back at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with a gentle voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm only saying this since you keep saying I missed out on your project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I rejected that film because I thought it would flop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... What did you say?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supernatural. I rejected it because I thought it would flop. Won't you need around 4 million viewers to break even? I think it'll be a complete failure. There is no need to send my actress to a failing film so that she can fail together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What, you, just what...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Cha Jaeho's eyes bulged like a fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing him stutter with a stiff tongue, I smiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you so serious when I'm just guy with poor judgment?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brushed off his hand, which was still on my shoulder, and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long while, I heard him burst into swears behind me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the heat wave passed, and a cool breeze now blew on mornings and evenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Well-Made's investments and investments from partial investors we've scraped together, we finally began preparing to film. The film schedule and content meetings progressed day and night, and we filled our staff with SBE Film's leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we were looking to cast supporting and minor roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Actor casting?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, we were hoping you would participate in auditions and the casting process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SBE Film's project producer handed me a thick file. Opening it, it was full of actor profiles. There were some familiar faces, but the majority were new to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discussed what would be something you can participate in and be a hot topic when released in articles, and we concluded that it would be most interesting if you participated in casting actors. Your eye for actors is very good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer added two more similarly thick files as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all the ones we received at our company so far, so take a look at their pictures. We made an announcement, so we'll have to hold auditions soon. We are trying to approach actors with enough popularity to play supporting roles, but it might not work out since Mr. Nam Joyoon is the lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Ah, that could happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might not be satisfied with a lead with less fame than them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be difficult to fill all our minor roles through just auditions. Auditions are also differentiated between big budgets and smaller budgets. Good actors aim for auditions for blockbusters that are likely to be a success or films of well-known directors to get close to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I bet Alive had it easy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then, we were overflowing with applicants. I wonder when we'll ever be able to experience that boom again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licking his lips, the project producer led me to the office. Perhaps it was because they were working throughout the night finishing up preparations before the filming began, but SBE Film and Forest's employees were flopped over chairs and desks and sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with their arms crossed was standing beside a sofa messily stacked with files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His clothes were so tidy that it was borderline mysophobia. He was a man in his thirties, who looked like he would smell like ink if you got close. After seeing us, he uncrossed his arms and came over. His eyes were filled with interest as they looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, which is Chief Lee Kyojin. He's the casting director."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casting director?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung was staring out the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director, who was sitting on the sofa, glanced at him while asking,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you planning on doing about Jung Sunwoo, Team Leader Jung, if City Jungle fails?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no reply. The director scratched his round chin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since you've been quiet on the matter, everyone's been making their own predictions. There are also rumors that you're going to fire him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There still was no answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swirling his tea with a teaspoon, the director raised his head before flinching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung was silently laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:31:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 205-206</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78581/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 205: Once You Start Being Swayed (3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, did you win the lottery?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I did, I would be investing in real estate instead of a movie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then what? Are you interested in small investments?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I licked my lower lip and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to mobilize everything I can to invest in this movie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer's gaze alternated between me and the scenario. He looked like he was faced with a dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Why?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because I'm so taken by the project that I want to invest in it, obviously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So taken... Please wait."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer jolted up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ten minutes... I'll come back before the ice melts!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having rushed down the hall, the project producer entered the CEO's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh! What great timing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SBE CEO said with a serious face nested on top of his locked hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You remember 'Dating Time at 3rd Period'. The one we rejected because it wasn't fun? Apparently, Watermelon Pictures picked it up?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon? Watermelon wants to film that? I guess we really are in a scenario famine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do we do if it's a success?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO tapped his toes on the floor. His actions exuded how anxious he was. As his confidence and ego reached the skies after Alive's revolutionary success, he was becoming more distressed every day under the pressure that his next project had to be a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thinking about it again, I think it might have been good. Why did you have to reject it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're the one who told me to reject it! Your standards have shot up after Alive became a success! Also, the '3rd Period' or whatever, it's not good. If it becomes a hit, then that CEO used the luck of his ancestors. No, that's not the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chatting project producer waved his hand. Then he placed both hands on top of the CEO's desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung Sunwoo from W&amp;amp;U is here right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why? Is he looking for a good scenario again? I wish there was one too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, he brought one over today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO's eyes widened. The project producer told him about the short conversation he had with Jung Sunwoo and all the information he was quickly able to find about City Jungle. The CEO, who had been nodding his head while listening, shared his thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now really? Was there nothing else to be obsessed with? Is he crazy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought the same thing, but I suddenly thought about what a reporter had said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Making Film and Pretty Girls' big hit, which resulted in an almost syndrome-like phenomenon, countless people have been talking about Jung Sunwoo. The project producer recalled the remark he heard on a late-night cable entertainment show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although W&amp;amp;U's Jung Sunwoo occasionally takes crazy actions, those actions always ended up being an incredible success, so you can't call him crazy. If he does something crazy next time, I wish I could participate as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO's face soured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then... shall we listen to what he has to say?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung Sunwoo from W&amp;amp;U, what was his reaction?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ant Capital employees across from him asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan nonchalantly chewed on his sushi as he replied,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was really good? He was more positive than I expected. He said that he would give us a call after looking over it with Ms. Lee Songha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Someone like Lee Songha would be great! She has that hype factor and will do well in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought that it would be good if he didn't swear at us for reversing Nam Joyoon's casting offer. It seems Team Leader Jung Sunwoo was quite taken by your short film?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I think he liked it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team Leader Jung Sunwoo he had met at the afterparty acted very amiably towards him. Even though there were other directors who exceeded him, like those who won the grand prize and the excellence award, he felt that Jung Sunwoo was particularly interested in him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was well-known that Team Leader Jung Sunwoo recognized people who would be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was why he had thought that he might be able to get Jung Sunwoo to immediately sign on if he talked to him face-to-face, so his actions were slightly disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, he couldn't say that. He first had to prove his skill and worth to the investment company employees in front of him. If he couldn't, then he would lose the director position he was finally able to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good work, Director Joo. But did he have nothing to say about the change in directors?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, he seemed to easily accept it. Well, directors get changed in the middle of production these days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang said while rubbing his chiseled jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The movie production company can't refuse our demands because the project will be overturned if we pull our investments. They don't have any other investment distribution companies either. Nor do they have partial investors. Therefore, our words hold the most sway. No matter how much Director Oh Hyunkyung endures, you'll be the one directing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thank you for the opportunity!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan bowed his head. His lips were subtle trembling due to his excitement. He had his debut project in his hands. It wasn't an independent film but a commercial one to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his confidence took a blow after bowing down to moneylending investors, it had its value. He was able to take Director Oh Hyunkyung's edited scenario and position in one fell swoop thanks to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He planned on making City Jungle a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he is able to make a box office hit once, production companies and investors will stick to him for his next project. Also, he could make those who didn't even give his scenarios and directing skills a glance regret not working with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will work hard in making the move to make you not regret investing in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang's eyes narrowed into slivers as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo, do you know the return on national movie investments?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's in the negatives. -7%. You know that commercial films that released last year? The ones with at least a billion won in budget, not overall costs. According to the Korean Film Council, half of them flopped without being able to recover their budget. Only 16 actually reached their breakeven point. Investors go crazy about that. But do you know why they still invest...?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang placed the City Jung scenario, which was in the seat beside him, onto the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are occasionally big hits. Not a large-scale blockbuster that every investor wants in on. Ones with good scenarios but lack public appeal or trendiness. Ones people don't have an eye one like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang continued while tapping on the scenario with his chopsticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If something like this succeeds, we'll get a 200-300% return. This is why we are investing in this. That's why, please work hard in making it. It is why we changed the directors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan frowned. Director Hwang continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While you're better than a director, whose past projects failed, you aren't really a great pick either. We decided to bring you in as the director as you were the writer of the original scenario and told us that you would be most cooperating. If things don't seem to work out, then, like you said, directors could change mid-production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Do not worry. I am confident in making the film a success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan said with a crooked smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn't plan on being swayed by the investment company like this. He planned on quickly bringing in other investors. If the number of investment companies increased, then Ant Captial's stake and influence would shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also had bait to lure other investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, who was receiving a lot of attention from investors with his Midas's Hand title. Lee Songha, the international star that created hype whenever she decided on a project. If he put those two out there, other investors would undoubtedly be interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Director Joo Jaechan was confident in persuading Jung Sunwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two people across from me were boring holes in me with their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer, who rushed out, returned in ten minutes like he said. Along with the CEO of SBE Films. He seemed to have looked into the situation around City Jungle, as his expression was stranger than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer started the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I looked into it, and the production situation is a complete mess."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A production company that couldn't assign a director they wanted due to the sway the investment company's move had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight between an unknown director and a rookie director, who argued the project was theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, it was surprising that a project being produced in a situation like this to have had such box office appeal and quality. This was probably why people said projects fated to succeed would succeed even if covered in crap, while project not meant to succeed could not no matter how hard they tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I let out a breath and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's true that the situation is a complete mess, however, it's a project I would like to bring in. I believe the film's potential will greatly increase once the environment improves. That is why I was hoping to actively intervene and create that environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shook my fishing rod with my quiet voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A good environment?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For example, if a skilled production company joined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the project producer briefly before turning to the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Or looking for a trustworthy joint production partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A joint production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO rubbed his chin. He didn't look completely uninterested, so I explained in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The film production company, Forest, started off as a mid-sized import distributor, so they had many lacking areas in terms of production. That is why they are very open to joint production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying they were very open to it was a bit of an understatement. When I asked Forest's CEO on what he thought about a joint production, he held onto my words like they were a lifeline. While their profits would be split if it became a joint production, but he seemed more interested in splitting the burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO, who had been silently listening to me, crossed his arms and nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we would have to read the scenario again, vaguely remembering it, it didn't really pull me in. I think the scenario was good, but because there isn't a lot of popularity for noir genre films in the country, I don't think it'll be a box office success. Comedy-dramas are mainstream right now, and this one is too dark."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mainstream? You're the one who created a zombie film with tens of billions of won and an all-star cast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO coughed at my words. I saw the corners of his lips rise. I heard he liked the review about how he persevered and pushed a nonmainstream movie to success while other production companies came out with mainstream movies that standardized the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I also came here because the CEO had a hand in various different genres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the project producer, the production producer, who was on Alive's set, as well as the investment support team that mediated investment companies. They all knew the industry like the back of their hand and were highly skilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you're actively intervening, then are you going to decide the leads?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am. Or else, there is no need to be so aggressive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who are they?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their ears perked as they leaned towards me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still discussing it. I'll let you know once it's been decided. It's a promise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer's eyes narrowed at my words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have you gone to other production companies?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I came to SBE first. I was thinking about going to Well-Made if I got rejected here..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO cut me off and picked up the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's talk after reading the scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, but I heard that two directors are vying for the megaphone? While the scenario is one thing, due to the characteristic of the genre, the directions of the director are very important as well. Depending on their directing skills, it could go from being 'charismatic' to 'corny'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I nodded while replying. The project producer said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have you decided which of the two you will have direct?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for rejecting CEO Baek Hansung's offer was because I wanted to walk my own path instead of one someone else created for me. In order to not be swayed by the opportunity, but instead use it to my advantage. To not be swayed by my future visions, and instead, use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I want to make this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did. It wasn't simply because it was a success in the future. I sincerely wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then how did I want to make this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would I have done if I didn't see the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart raced as I thought this. Then, I decided to take a different path from the one my future visions carved me. I stepped onto an uncertain path. I thought that the path would disappear and would be dark, but that was not the case. After stepping off the path, I could see countless paths at my feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A path that could lead to failure. A path that could lead to even greater success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under these uncertain circumstances, I was certain of one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each step I took was more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan and Director Hwang from Ant Capital entered the restaurant together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a meeting to decide on our next steps now that the City Jungle director has been decided over a meal. They also planned on bringing up the topic of lead roles to Team Leader Jung Sunwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo, you said you haven't heard back from Team Leader Jung Sunwoo yet, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, it seems he's planning on bringing it up when everyone's here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Team Leader Jung Sunwoo reserved this restaurant, so I think we can consider it a certainty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan laughed heartily at Director Hwang's words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restaurant employee who guided them opened the sliding door. There were already a few people sitting inside. The two greeted them as they entered but stopped. Beside Forest's CEO, who was sitting rigidly, seemingly nervous, was Director Oh Hyunkyung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan spoke in an irritated voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Oh, why are you here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To talk about the film, of course. Do you think I came to see you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung said, raising her eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, what I mean is, why are you...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan barely managed to contain his voice. He saw the people sitting across from Director Oh Hyunkyung. Team Leader Jung Sunwoo was sitting next to some people he was seeing for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Jung Sunwoo shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone's here. Shall we discuss the film now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 206: Once You Start Being Swayed (4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, let's hear what the situation is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang of Ant Capital said in a leisurely manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, Director Joo Jaechan also suppressed his agitation. There was no need to get agitated. Even if Director Oh Hyunkyung came here clinging onto someone's pant leg, she couldn't push him, who had strong support from the investment company, out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo introduced everyone in this restless atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, this is the project producer from SBE Film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business card the man handed out had his position, project producer, and name clearly printed. Director Joo Jaechan dazedly stared at the business card. SBE Film. The production company that produced the megahit film, Alive, with Director Choi Sungwon. It was also one of the places he brought his scenario to and was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang opened his mouth with an 'Ah'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No wonder you seemed familiar. How are you here together?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"City Jungle may be a joint collaboration with us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With SBE Film?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang's eyes widened. Then his gaze alternated between Jung Sunwoo, SBE Film's project producer, and Forest's CEO. Then, as if he understood the situation, he nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems Team Leader Jung Sunwoo acted as the bridge. It's great for investors if an experienced production company joins. You've also worked with Ms. Lee Songha before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, Director Joo Jaechan was doing his best to calm his excitement. This excitement was not of fury but high hopes. The higher the level of the production company, the higher his level and value, as the director, rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Director Joo Jaechan was hyped up, the project producer licked his lips and replied,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are familiar. Also familiar with Mr. Nam Joyoon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Mr. Nam Joyoon and Ms. Lee Songha as the leads, there shouldn't be any scuffles on set."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait, I think there is a misunderstanding. We only wanted to cast..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang glanced back at Director Joo Jaechan. His gaze clearly asked how he handled the casting matter. Flustered, Director Joo Jaechan shook his head and looked at Jung Sunwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung! I clearly only extended the offer to Ms. Lee Songha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I received two offers. One for the male lead and another for the female lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, but we explained the situation. There was an internal miscommunication regarding Mr. Nam Joyoon...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope that we can proceed with both."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo said with a smile. At the same time, Director Hwang's expression stiffened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we don't take Mr. Nam Joyoon, you won't give us Ms. Lee Songha, is that it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That makes it sound like I'm selling you untalented actors. Especially when the casting offer first came to Joyoon hyung, Mr. Nam Joyoon. The male lead. I am certain he'll be able to do it better than anyone else. If you don't believe me, I'm fine if you hold an audition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, you will be certain. He's your actor. And I don't think we need to hold an audition. Our views are clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang said resolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I oppose having Mr. Nam Joyoon as the lead. What are your thoughts, Director Joo?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... To be honest, I wanted to ask for Mr. Seo Jijoon as the male lead. The reaction when he worked with Ms. Lee Songha was quite good too. It just happens that he hasn't decided on his next project yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan agreed, nodding his head subtly. He had been planning on bringing up Seo Jijoon once Lee Songha was decided. Any investors would drool with that lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung. Could you reconsider with Mr. Seo Jijoon..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the role will better suit Mr. Nam Joyoon than Mr. Seo Jijoon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reply was as firm as Director Hwang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Director Joo Jaechan was figuring out what to say, Director Hwang clicked his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, I think you believe that investors are going to rush to give you their money if you act, but that's only if you push the right actors. We're talking about the lead here, the lead. It's too early to trust in Ms. Lee Songha since it's her first time playing the female lead in a film. If the movie flops, at least the actors will have played lead roles. The investors are taking all the losses. If you are going to pull Ms. Lee Songha too, then do just that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After saying those sharp words, Director Hwang looked at Forest's CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO, if this is how you're going to proceed with casting, then we can't invest in this film. How about we make you a list and you choose from there?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood in the room became even colder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan's eyes quickly darted back and forth. If the investment company took command of the casting, then his plan would go belly up. Director Joo Jaechan was about to persuade Jung Sunwoo once more when he shut his mouth. Jung Sunwoo's reaction was strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't shaken up in the least in a situation like this. It was the same for Forest's CEO and SBE Film's project producer. They simply let out a short sigh or clicked their tongues. As though what was coming had finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do you think, Director Oh Hyunkyung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo abruptly asked. Director Oh Hyunkyung replied in a serious manner,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I said this multiple times, but I think Mr. Nam Joyoon is perfect as the male lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now really, here I was wondering what was going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Hwang couldn't help but laugh. Director Oh Hyunkyung continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I also received positive replies from other investors I have been working hard to persuade. Because they are partial investors, individually they don't make up a large amount, but I'll be able to persuade more partial investors once our leads are set."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest's CEO flinched in surprise. Avoiding Director Hwang's sharp glare, he supported Director Oh Hyunkyung with a gloomy face. Director Hwang, who had been drinking cold water with a dumbfounded face, eventually place his cup down in a tossing manner before getting up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then do what you want."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sliding door loudly opened and closed. Director Joo Jaechan blankly looked at the door Director Hwang slammed. The situation was progressing weirdly. At this rate, there was no doubt he would end up no better than an abandoned duck egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His eyes darted around. He looked at Forest's CEO, Director Oh Hyunkyung, and SBE Film's project producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, at Jung Sunwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hastily spoke,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, please give me a moment of your time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo readily got up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their way out of the building, Director Joo Jaechan's mind was churning. This was a chance that the heavens had given him. He couldn't lose his scenario and his debuting work like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the CEO with no backbone supported Director Oh Hyunkyung, this was only because Jung Sunwoo and Director Oh Hyunkyung were of the same opinion. It was Jung Sunwoo who brought in SBE Film. The one who was in control of the current situation was also Team Leader Jung Sunwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that all he had to do was persuade him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thinking about what you said, I think Mr. Nam Joyoon will also be fine. No, good. I can also persuade the partial investors Director Oh Hyunkyung mentioned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan said with confidence. Of course, he was certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the same conditions, he was certain that Jung Sunwoo would choose him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please let me take care of the actors as we discussed. You also prefer my directin...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw Director Oh Hyunkyung's previous works, and I really liked her directing. It was surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo tilted his head. It was difficult to read what he was thinking. That expression made Director Joo Jaechan feel more uneasy. He almost clung to him, trying to persuade him, but Jung Sunwoo's expression did not change. Director Joo Jaechan raised his voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader! No matter how good her directing was, weren't they all failures in the end? Unless you're crazy, how can you entrust your actors to a director like that...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan, who was expressing his frustrations, paused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo was grinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People asked me whether I was crazy on multiple occasions, but these actions weren't crazy to me. But this choice really is crazy. Logically speaking, the decision is clear, but I am making the illogical choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo, who was mumbling incomprehensibly, said in a clear-cut manner,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyways, the person I want to entrust my actors to is Director Oh Hyunkyung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan swore under his breath. His chance was slipping from his fingers. Malice surged up from his belly. If they were bent on pushing him out, then he also had a way to make this a complete mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan revealed a crooked smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I'll sue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sue?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"City Jungle is my work!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was now Jung Sunwoo's turn to laugh. Laughing like he was refreshed, he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll put your name in the credits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that it's not even worth suing over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to regret today once the film flops!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I let Director Joo Jaechan's curse in one ear and out the other as I went back in the building. Director Cha Jaeho, who was directing Supernatural, also mocked me, saying that I would regret it. I didn't know why they were all so impatient to pray for my future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was returning to the room when I saw someone standing in front of the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Director Oh Hyunkyung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing outside? It's time we go in and discuss the film for real."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wanted to thank you. You undoubtedly had other options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options, huh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan, or even other, more trustworthy, directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did consider it. Even while I was watching Director Oh Hyunkyung's previous works and thinking she really didn't lack skills but was really unlucky. Even while I reminded myself that the emotions I was feeling from the scenario were all from Director Oh Hyunkyung. Even while seeing her constantly on the move to change the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the tips of the scales didn't fully lean towards her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said they wanted to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at Director Oh Hyunkyung, who was confused, I remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What project do you want to do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I asked, Lee Songha, as if waiting, put out three stacks of paper. One was a drama script, the other two were drama proposals. Just as I gulped dryly, Lee Songha spoked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm still undecided between the three of them. I haven't picked out the drama, but for the film, this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha placed a scenario over the drama script and proposals. City Jungle. I relaxed as soon as I saw the title on the front page. Then my suspicions began to bud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you hear anything at the company?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About what?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, what do you like about this scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha replied nonchalantly to my question,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scenario is fun. And, above all, the female lead is impressive. She also has a large role. There are a lot of dramas where the female lead has a large part, but it's rare to find in movies. I think I'll regret it if I miss out. Also..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha smiled slightly before adding,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It made me think that the director who wrote the script became very attached to the character as she wrote it. I thought she would film me with that sense of attachment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Nam Joyoon the same question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung, which one do you want to do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon took out a scenario from a tower of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"City Jungle. The one you gave me last. It interests me the most."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Why?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked with narrowed eyes, Nam Joyoon calmly replied,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because it's fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You find all scenarios fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more fun. Also... This caught my eye."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took out something that was carefully placed in a transparent file. A colorful paper. It was the casting offer that I first received from Director Oh Hyunkyung. The sincere, earnest, embarrassing offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been ten years since I last received something like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I gave it to him in hopes he would be charmed by it, I didn't think it would be this effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon scratched his neck as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't care if it's a brief role, I want to do this movie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's what they said. Both of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked over after speaking. Director Oh Hyunkyung had a strange expression on her face. Her brows were contorted, and the corners of her lips were raised. Like someone who didn't know whether she should laugh or cry. I let out a short breath before greeting Director Oh Hyunkyung once more,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So please take care of us from now on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving Director Oh Hyunkyung, who was standing rigidly, I opened the sliding door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The room was filled with dark clouds. SBE Film's project producer was on the phone wearing a serious expression, while Forest's CEO's deathly pale face seemed to have already been soaked in the rain. He looked over at me and mumbled,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our main investor is gone. Now, what do we do..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to find other investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:30:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 203-204</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78580/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 203: Once You Start Being Swayed (1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO! What are you trying to do?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Oh, don't act like this outside. Let's go inside the meeting room-!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you embarrassed that rumors will spread that this is a mess? If you know that, then why do it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, that's not it. Let's sit and calm down-!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you think I can calm down? How can you do this to me!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one in frenzy was Director Oh Hyunkyung. She was almost yelling with hostility. The film production company CEO was stuck in the middle with a pale face soaked in cold sweat. It seemed he was trying to calm the fires as best he could, but Director Joo Jaechan poured oil to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why can't he? You signed the contract and handed over the production rights for that scenario to the film production company. Then it's their right to decide who to give the megaphone to. Isn't that right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already decided that I would be the one directing!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no clause about it in the contract though?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO! You promised to leave it to me! City Jungle is my project!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, I would like to...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to get to the nitty-gritty, then it's my project! I'm the original writer who wrote the first draft! All you did was take it and embellish it a little!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What did you say? You rat!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument quickly became a dog fight. They acted like they were the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pushed the brim of my hat down. I acted like a spectator who was hesitating on whether to call 112 or not. The employees were so dumbstruck that they didn't have the time to concern themselves with a spectator next to the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Oh Hyunkyung. This is a business matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone joined in with a sigh. It was a man wearing a suit and sitting on an empty table. He seemed to a man of influence as they immediately quieted down. Their gazes were all focused on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From an investor's perspective, we have decided that, unless it's a famous director, it would be better to go with a rookie director who won an award at a film festival than Director Oh. The picture will be good since he's also the original writer. There have been cases where a director's debuting film becomes a huge hit and people cause a fuss about how he's a monster rookie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's important is that the film is a success. How about we settle this matter peacefully with you handing the megaphone over to him and getting credited as an embellishment writer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung's face turned red and pale at the man's words. The film production company CEO went over and said something to him, but he was steadfast with his decision. Director Oh Hyunkyung tried her best to persuade him and finally said with a desperate face,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have currently made an offer to W&amp;amp;U's Team Leader Jung Sunwoo to cast the male lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung Sunwoo? Is he interested in the scenario?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name was suddenly brought up. Their reactions were immediate. Director Joo Jaechan's eyes were wide open, and the CEO seemed to be in a sticky situation. Finally, the man in the suit, who seemed to be part of the investors, rushed in like a hyena that found a piece of meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How far have the talks progressed? Does it seem positive? Who are you discussing for the male lead? Seo Jijoon? Im Joowon? Or the one everyone's up in arms about, Song Inho?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Nam Joyoon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He became famous with Alive. Don't you know him? He received praise as a scene stealer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man tapped his phone like he was searching for Nam Joyoon's profile before frowning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the hell? Are you planning on filming an independent film? Who's going to invest billions of won in a project with an unknown director and a supporting-role-level, washed-up rookie? There needs to be something we can put our hopes on. And here I was thinking you had some casting skills."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man harshly ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you think the movie will be successful if you cast any actor as long as you have Jung Sunwoo promoting you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's not any actor. He's someone I decided after careful deliberation. I saw all the independent films he's appeared in and his image fits well with the male lead. He's also good at acting..!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're so frustrating. If that was enough, then everyone would pick up theater actors from Daehangno and use them. Why would they bother pouring tons of money to try to get a top star? That's enough. CEO, if our director-change proposal doesn't get settled, then we're going to withdraw our investments and leave. You can look for other investors. Nam Joyoon... Now really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just then, Director Joo Jaechan joined in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I met Team Leader Jung Sunwoo at the short film festival afterparty. He seemed particularly interested in my projects. I even received his business card. He said that he really enjoyed my short film and to contact him if I had a good project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan glanced at Director Oh Hyunkyung before boasting,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll try talking to him this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film production company, Forest's CEO, peeked into his office as he wet his dry lips. He saw the back of a man sitting in a chair through the opaque window. Seeing his dark appearance, he looked like loan shark coming to collect money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The huddled employees pushed the CEO's back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't hurry me. I haven't organized my thoughts yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the ice in the coffee completely melted while you were organizing your thoughts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After realizing this, the CEO placed the two mugs down and handed it over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're both melted. Go make them again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They look fine for now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a flood, how is it fine? Quickly, no, slowly go make them again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After sending the employee off, he pressed his chest and let out a sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just as I thought I could take a breather after sending the directors and investor off..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He probably came because of City Jungle, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did he like the scenario? I heard he's picky when choosing projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like it's for other top stars. It's for Nam Joyoon. Since he received a male lead role after now finally becoming slightly known as a supporting actor, this opportunity probably appealed to him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do we do if he wants to sign a contract right now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employees became silent at the producer's words. Their gazes gathered on the CEO, but he was busy shaking his leg and wiping his sweat with a handkerchief. He looked like he was about to have a mental breakdown and collapse. The employees continued talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to decline. Is there anything else we can do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like this is a joke. What if our relationship with him sours because of this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What can we do when we might lose our investments? To be honest, the reactions of other investors will probably be the same. We all opposed the idea in the beginning. We were simply persuaded by Director Oh Hyunkyung because of how confident she was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What if we say that we are in talks with other actors?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we get caught, we will be cursed to hell. Why don't we blame it all on the investors? That they were causing a fuss about how they didn't like the actor. Wouldn't it be better to whine about how much of a tough situation we're in?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO, who was slumped in one corner, nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, let's go with that. Producer Lee, you go and talk to him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe it's only right for an influential man like you to talk to him, CEO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the CEO held two newly made cups of iced coffee and entered his office. His guest, Jung Sunwoo, who seemed to be lost in thought, got up after sensing someone was in the room. The CEO felt his fluttering heart squeeze. His guest seemed to have more influence and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello, CEO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah! Yes, you must have waited a long time. We were trying to quickly find some ice. In case you were hot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo made smiling eyes as he accepted the coffee. The CEO squeezed into his chair and glanced at the man in front of him. He looked younger than he thought. Since he was supposedly twenty-eight on his profile, he was young in reality as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be a team leader at a company like W&amp;amp;U at his age. He probably didn't have to brown-nose anyone with all those talented actors he had under him. After tasting a bitter taste in his mouth, the CEO got to the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But why did you contact..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's because of the City Jungle scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why didn't you contact the director first..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't know which director to call out of the two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO flinched in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard that the production situation is chaotic right now. If that's not the case, then we can immediately talk about cast..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, it is chaotic. We aren't in a situation where we can begin casting yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO did his best to beat around the bushes now that he saw his opportunity. Jung Sunwoo listened while reacting back. The CEO initially thought that there would be an arrogant side to Jung Sunwoo since he was on the path of success at such a young age, but he was unexpectantly very respectful. The CEO's nervousness quickly dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, his mouth was rambling on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I'm in a pinch. When I think of loyalty, obviously we should work with Director Oh Hyunkyung. Director Oh worked so hard trying to create this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard that she even took out a loan to pay a sizable amount for the rights to the scenario. However, the director who wrote the first draft seemed to have somehow talked to the investment company, as they suddenly called for a change in directors... It really was a bolt out of the blue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo Jaechan persuaded the investment company?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That fellow went around to different production and investment companies after receiving an award at the film festival, but his synopsis was rejected. He was rejected by the investment company we are working with, and it seemed he saw the City Jungle scenario over there. He decided to force his way in after finding out that the rights were signed over to the film production company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then which investment company is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo lightly asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The investment firm, Ant Capital. We are in discussion for a 5-billion-won investment, so if we can't get them, then the production immediately falls through. But that doesn't mean we can just readily switch out the director. Once we start to get swayed, we'll probably be swayed by the investment company throughout production..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sighing, the CEO suddenly came to his senses and added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until this is settled, there is going to be a stop on casting. Sorry..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung Sunwoo, who was lost in his thoughts, asked in a courteous voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Theirs is something I want to propose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was quickly flipping through the last half of the scenario when an employee quickly approached me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A director has come looking for you. Again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I asked if he had an appointment, and he said that he'll wait until you had free time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a second, I thought that Director Oh Hyunkyung had come again. She had called me a few times, but I had manually replied that I was in the middle of a meeting. I was wondering if maybe she couldn't wait any longer and had come to the company again, but the name that came out of the employee's mouth was different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said he was Director Joo Jaechan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You told me to tell you whenever I had a good project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan said in the exact same place Director Oh Hyunkyung sat not too long ago. Their expressions had a similar side to them as well. Especially their passion-filled eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mood seemed different every time I saw him. He looked well-mannered at the afterparty. And he seemed like a completely different person when he argued with Director Oh Hyunkyung. His gaze now was very similar to his future self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did say that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This scenario. I believe you've received it from other channels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took out a scenario from his backpack. Or it was besides the empty director field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a scenario I was familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I read it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a project I had held onto for a long time since I was a student. I had certain circumstances which led its rights to be handed over for a while. That was why I couldn't bring it up when you asked if I had any other projects. Now the situation has changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His heated voice was filled with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I'll be the one directing this film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not Director Oh Hyunkyung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She will be taken off the project and will have her name under 'Script Embellisher' in the credits. I'll be the one directing. I heard that you met with Director Oh once, but I had something I wanted to say about casting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His eyes darted quickly as he examined my reaction before he added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be honest, back when I was an aspiring director, this scenario was pretty much snatched from me. I couldn't get a good price for it either. That is why I couldn't say that it was a scenario I wrote and completely regretted my decision, but it finally returned to its rightful owner. I will put my life on the line..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flipped over a few pages as I listened. There was no need to look at it. There was not a single character missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scenario is the edited version?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not the first draft you wrote."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan replied nonchalantly,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are pretty much the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think so. I asked the film production company and received a copy. The first draft with no title. I'm reading it right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recalled the scenario I was halfway done reading as I said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are completely different projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are completely different projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 204: Once You Start Being Swayed (2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screenplays are things that increase in polish after numerous drafts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more like she took the idea and rewrote the entire script though."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That idea is the most important. There is no final draft without the first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propped my chin up and stared at Director Joo Jaechan. He looked like he desperately wanted to escape from this embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. Director Joo Jaechan forced a smile as though he was suppressing his emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you perhaps talk to Director Oh Hyunkyung? I don't know what she told you, but the matter has been settled internally. She caused a ruckus at the film production company not long ago. There's a reason why the investors want to assign the project to me instead of her... You also said that you liked my directing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His eyes gradually began to shine with madness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a project I must direct with my own hands. It's true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That it would become a great work in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he couldn't keep his hands still, crossing and uncrossing his fingers, I said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will there be any problems in the future?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon? Problems?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Oh Hyunkyung. She seemed very attached to the scenario. It'll become noisy if she files a lawsuit once the movie goes into production. Articles will also mention actors' names."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan blinked. Then, with an excited face, he jumped from his seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do not need to worry about that! No one would film a movie if you could sue investment and production companies with this. Who would work with a director like that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He glanced at my expression before chatting more excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This. She already signed over the rights to the production company. Because the production company is adjusting the movie's budget, they'll have to do their best to cooperate with investment companies. That is why a lawsuit isn't worth mentioning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not worth mentioning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, Director Oh Hyunkyung will be credited as an embellishing writer. There are cases where a scenario goes through various writers, so you can't argue that it is your work because you edited it. This is how it works in this industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. That is how this industry works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the time our talk was about to end, an employee knocked on the meeting room door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, you have another guest. The mood is a bit..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whispering employee trailed his words. Director Oh Hyunkyung approached from the half-opened door. She looked like she aged ten years. Thick veins filled her eyes, making the whites in her eyes look red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry for barging in again, team leader!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She bowed then stood rigid in place as though struck by lightning when she noticed Director Joo Jaechan. The person who looked like she was about to die now looked like she was ready to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You rat-faces bast...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What great timing. I just happened to finish talking with the team leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan nonchalantly stood up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then I will await your call, team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He bid farewell, as though showing off to her, before passing her. Even though this took less than a minute, Director Oh Hyunkyung's complexion went from deathly black to pale white. She faltered like she had lost her spirit and sat down in the seat in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How much of the situation did he tell you..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That the main investment company opposed casting Joyoon hyung, and that the director was likely to be replaced. This is the most unsettling production circumstances I have encountered so far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyungkyung's head drooped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am truly sorry that things ended up this way after proposing it to you so confidently. I was sincere when I said that I thought Mr. Nam Joyoon was perfect as the male lead. This was something I should have persuaded the investment company. But the situation suddenly..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, investment companies may have different options on the cast than you. Because they also have a big say on the matter. I understand the situation. What are you planning on doing now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if my words stung, Director Oh Hyunkyung flinched. She simply opened and closed her dry lips for a moment before hastily getting up. She desperately pleaded,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader, I know this is a shameless request, but if you really like the scenario, could you consider Ms. Lee Songha or Ms. Son Chaeyoung for the female lead? Then I could try to persuade the investment companies again. If you have any conditions, I'll definitely...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her teary voice dampened. She had been avoiding my gaze, worried about what my reaction would be, but now she raised her head and checked my expression. The next moment, her face dropped in despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am in my mid-forties. An age overflowing with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was the CEO of a global management company who wore a classic suit, one that those British secret service agents would wear, and worked in a luxurious office akin to that of a penthouse apartment. After convincing myself this, I became more comfortable in confronting CEO Baek Hansung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you bring your resignation letter?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, damn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Resignation letter?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the type of face you're making. You've been glaring at me for a while now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My face is always like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that, but it seems particularly resistive today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung laughed in a low voice before asking,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If not a resignation letter, have you come to prepare an exclusive contract?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will you even do that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want. I told you that I'll manage you like a celebrity. Do you also want a signing fee?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to do City Jungle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I poured cold water onto the warming mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I tried to forcefully give it up, but it felt like my insides were turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even celebrities can express their opinion when they aren't considered rookies anymore. Whether it's years of experience or fame, I believe I have passed that of a rookie. Also, above all, you are someone who respects the option of the celebrity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave some lip service at the end, but the mood was still chilly. I felt like I would freeze to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung frowned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did I not say it so that you understand? Other celebrities can get back up if they fail once, however, your title is like a sand castle. Once you fail, its strategic value collapses. I had thought I gave you a great offer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I also think that it was a great offer since I would be walking a smooth path if I just do as the company decides. If I just follow that path, my career would also be excellent. It's a great opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you are aware. Then why?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a similar experience. Once you start on that path, you end up getting hung up on it like an addict. And if that path cuts off, you get withdraw symptoms like a crazy person. It'll become difficult to take a single step on my own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I swept away all thoughts on going on different paths and stared at CEO Baek Hansung. He was also staring at me. He no longer kept up his composure and gentle smile. He had no expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought up my conclusion, which I had wrung my brain to come to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is why, rather than getting swayed my opportunities, I plan on using them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a movie with a high risk of failure was a problem...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will increase the movie's potential with my own hands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic value. A sand-castle-like title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to not get hung up on those things, I will create my own worth through my own ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A declaration of war."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's the only one who's ever declared war on the CEO. He'll be the only one ever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even the Team 2 Leader, who's been at the company for so long, was cut off in an instant. Where does he get the courage? I think he's a sociopath or something. How can a normal person with over two years of experience declare war to his CEO's face?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I corrected the fellows who were chatting near my desk so that I could hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wasn't to the point of declaring war."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you said, 'Screw you, I'm going to do things my way,' then that's a declaration of war."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you prepare a resignation letter? You might end up having to leave without saying goodbye, so wouldn't it be best if we had a farewell party ahead of time?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader, Kim Hyunjo, Chief Lee Bongjoon, and Chief Sung Uimin said one after the other. While they were joking, their faces were wrought with worry. Like they were certain I was going to be fired soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have you become tired of company life? Do you just want to act crookedly?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not tired, rather I'm completely motivated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amongst their dumbfounded faces, Kim Hyunjo rubbed his face as he asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So what are you going to do now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first place I went to was the outdoor filming set, a mud pool, of Good Friends. After greeting Producer Yoo Sooyoung, who became the main Good Friends producer after completing Making Film, I went to see the girls. They were on as guests as part of their comeback special, so all four of them rushed over to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered in mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't come over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why! Rather than giving us hugs for our hard work, are you running away from us because we are dirty? Were you that type of person?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am. Don't come over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four of them stuck to me, and soon, I was covered in mud. Lee Kwanwoo simply flinched his hands as he watched from afar. He seemed to have already been caught as his thick arms coming out his t-shirt and neck were covered in mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJ even rubbed mud under my shirt as she grinned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take a look since you're here. Today's shoot is dirty and fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keep it dirty and fun. I have things to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How is a manager busier than his girl group, who just made a comeback?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung grumbled. At least they had the energy to chitchat. Lee Taehee simply breathed, completely exhausted. She seemed to have been stuck in the mud the longest as her appearance was the most spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha avoided my gaze as she asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I look like the poop emoji right now. Should I go take a shower?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, you look good, like microwaved chocolate ice cream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chocolate ice cream?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her voice brightened. Lee Songha glanced at my face before smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your face looks brighter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, thanks for the mud pack. I put a scenario in the passenger seat for you,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A scenario? Did you come here to give me that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha's eyes shined. I nonchalantly shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was worried she would pick it if I showed that I was interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For multiple reasons. I wanted to see you girls before you went on your out-of-city schedule and give you a new scenario I received so that you could read it during your free time. Let me know if you're interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like someone said, a project was chosen by both the manager and celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left the set and drove to a small supermarket near a one-room apartment. Nam Joyoon was putting rice, curry, black bean sauce, meatballs and the like in a yellow shopping basket.&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; He made an awkward expression when he saw me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How did you know I was here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like it's my first time seeing you. You're probably buying stuff to fill your fridge with since I was coming over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon just laughed. I stacked his basket with rice and fruits and placed it on the counter as I said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I brought over another scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Movie?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes. I think it's best to read up to this one and decide on your next project. I'll ask a nutritionist to set up a diet for you, so follow that starting tomorrow. You need to maintain your body if you are going to work all day and night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon's expression completely changed when I mentioned filming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression of the middle-aged woman at the counter also changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you get a job? Oh, that's great news when you were going around with nothing to do!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Nam Joyoon, who was the official bum in his neighborhood, I dropped by my house. I wiped away the mud still stuck here and there, paid particular attention to my attire, and once I had a clean appearance like a salesman, I drove out to Chungmuro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amongst the densely populated forest of buildings, I found one with a huge banner of Alive and entered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment SBE Film's project producer saw my face, he shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have any. Really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Didn't you come to ask for any new, good scenarios?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then did he greet me happily and led the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I definitely thought you had a condition for coming. I'm now more afraid of phone calls from you than debt collectors. I told you I will contact you when we receive a good scenario. We have our relationship from Alive. It's a promise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How many times have you made that promise?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, but all the good scenarios have dried up these days. There are none!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We entered the meeting room while joking. An employee quickly brought over some drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you didn't come to see scenarios, then why...?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wanted to show you something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do? Show me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I handed the project producer an envelope. He received it with a dazed face before taking the City Jungle scenario out of it. After scanning the title and synopsis, his face became even more perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a scenario? I think I saw this before?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also came to SBE?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless a production company has an idea and is setting it up with a writer and director, most scenarios floating around Chungmuro without a production company usually pass through our company. We reject most of them for various reasons. I think this was one of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was it not good?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't remember it well, but it probably was if we rejected it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He closed the scenario he was glancing through and asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But why did you come over to a production company with a scenario... Don't tell me W&amp;amp;U is interested in production films? Is this a project W&amp;amp;U is investing in?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I replied while shaking my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project producer frowned like he had just heard some amazing nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Those are references to well-known instant foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:30:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 202</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78579/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 202: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It felt like a chicken bone was caught in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the company CEO, I judged that the title of 'Midas's Hand' has a high strategic value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strategic value?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, in various ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung said while tapping on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be honest, 'Midas's Hand' is a common expression. Entertainment reporters use it often because it can be used to package someone's character. Whether it's a producer or agency, anyone who has been moderately successful should have been called that. Myself included."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He showed me his phone. Then, to show me, he tapped his screen. There was a headline that read, 'W&amp;amp;U CEO Baek Hansung, Ascends as the Midas's Hand of the Entertainment World'. It was an old interview article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like he pointed out, the 'Midas's Hand' title was common in the article column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's rare for those with that title to really 'make everything they touch a hit'. For someone to have only had hits with no failures up until now, from what I know, you're the only one. Even as a joke, if we created a film based on you, we'd probably be criticized for the lack of realism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life story really did lack realism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having jokingly said this, CEO Baek Hansung stared at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reporters these days don't use that title often. The title 'Midas's Hand' has become analogous to you. That's why that common title now has strategic value. But about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He placed one of his chopsticks upright on the table. Then he let go of the top. The chopstick fell on the table, making a sharp sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That value is only effective while you have no failures. The moment you fail, it'll crumble like a sand castle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, are you telling me to maintain that title?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By any means?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. To be exact, I was thinking about proactively managing your title at the company level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Manage?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess it doesn't sound good?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like how you are managing Neptune and Nam Joyoon and building their image, the company will be managing you. As long as possible, so that you don't fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be managed by the company. Don't touch projects that have a high risk of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you telling me to do whatever the company tells me to do from now on?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is that what it sounds like?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tilted his head and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm saying to do what the company expects from you as a team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team leader. I was confused whether he brought me up to that position of the title 'Midas's Hand'. If that title decided my worth, then I would become someone unfitting of that position once I failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is that strategic value why I was quickly promoted to the team leader position?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't say it didn't have an influence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung willingly nodded his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, this is good for you. The company will help you grab success and will gold plate your career. This will also be a great investment for your future career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, really? His words were sweet like honey, but my neck felt stiff. It felt like there was a leash on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My voice sounded glum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although there's nothing I can do if you're against the project because it's mediocre, I cannot easily accept that I should give it up simply to eliminate risk. Isn't filtering out 'projects we should risk' my responsibility?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like I said, this is a sand castle that will crumble once you fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when a project is so great I believe we should take the risk?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hand it over to another team's chief. If it succeeds, we'll publish an article that you recommended that project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung replied with a still smiling face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath before opening my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And if I try to persuade you to trust my judgment..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His calm voice cut me off,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll be very disappointed in you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it because of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this why I gave up City Jungle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing CEO Baek Hansung's reaction, it was obvious that there was no room for persuasion. Then how much leeway did I have to make a decision? Did I even have any? His 'I'll be very disappointed' sounded to me as 'You'll fail'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if City Jungle, which I gave up, became a success?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would CEO Baek Hansung regret his decision today and change his mind? No. I even brought up Cat Guardian Ghost to persuade him. If he was going to change his mind with another one, then he wouldn't have opposed it so definitively this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He seemed to want to eliminate any potential risk of me failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If things continued this way, how many projects like City Jungle would I have to give up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sighed and raised my head. The cicadas overeagerly droned. In an alley devoid of any trees to provide you with shade, I saw a bunch of one-room apartments. This was a neighborhood I frequented around this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knocked on a familiar door. Soon, a low voice answered as the door opened. Nam Joyoon, with a bite-size peanut cereal bar in his mouth, looked at me with surprise. His eyes momentarily flashed with worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is something wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I just came over to see if you ate lunch yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon smiled and opened the door wide. The inside of his home was still dreary. There was a single bed and a knee-high desk stacked with scripts and scenarios. If we took them and the laptop out, you wouldn't think someone lived here. It would be believable to call this an empty unit ready for someone to move into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just eati- about to eat. Did you eat?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, please give me one spoonful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I did eat an astronomically expensive wild samkyetang, I couldn't remember if it went in mouth or nose. I rubbed my empty stomach and glanced through the scenarios spread on the desk. Nam Joyoon, who paced back and forth in front of the sink, came over with a troubled expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sunwoo, there is no rice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should I make some?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have any rice. I definitely had some yesterday. Do you want instant noodles?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he was planning on simply eating a cereal bar today. It was clear as day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung, why does your living conditions seem worse than before you signed?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where did all the advanced pay for his movie appearance evaporate to? I heard that he was happy that he didn't have to pay rent every month after switching his rental agreement to a lease.&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; He still should have enough to have meat every meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I sent him bundles of movie tickets, he shouldn't be spending it all on movie tickets like before either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then why was the living condition...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung, what are you doing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm trying to boil water. I have instant noodles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you boiling water in a frying pan? Where is your pot?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bottom is all burnt up. I planned on buying another one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You planned?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But not having one didn't bother me much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, damn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told you to change your incompetent lifestyle. If your private life was revealed on TV, you'll probably receive charity help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon simply rubbed his neck awkwardly and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took two instant noodle packages from the drawer. Seeing those packages, I thought that he at least wouldn't starve to death if he has that. Then I suddenly said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Check the expiry dates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's been that long since I've bought them. Instant noodles have a long shelf life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nam Joyoon kept his mouth shut once his eyes glanced over the back of the package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't tell me..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What month is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I snatched the packages from his hand and checked their expiry dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, my god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can there be expired instant noodles when you live alone?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't eat a lot of instant noodles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you a plant? Do you only drink water? Do you even drink water?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I opened the fridge, there wasn't even a bottle of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to die at this rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said after rubbing my face. I was so dumbfounded that I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a very serious worry on my mind but seeing your living conditions pulled me back to reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a dog day, so I ordered steamed chicken and sat across Nam Joyoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon was clearing the top of his desk/dining table when he asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What was your serious worry?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just company stuff. What did you do today, hyung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I read scenarios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew it. Like an unchanging evergreen, he must have been reading scenarios yesterday, the day before that, last week, and even last month. I sent him as many scenarios and scripts as I could get my hands on, and every time, he looked happy like he had received a birthday present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is the project so entertaining that you forgot to eat? No, as long as it's disguised as a scenario, it's a bigger priority to you than food. Still, is it fun reading them every day?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's what I enjoy most, so of course, it's fun every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What he enjoys most, huh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon looked back at the wobbly tower of scenarios as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't read them if I wanted to before I met you. Since they were so hard to get. Back then, I read projects that appeared in online scenario markets or those that revealed their scenarios after their release. Now, just looking at these stacks of scenarios you got me makes me happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For someone who didn't have anything to eat besides cereal bars and tap water, he sure looked lively and satisfied whenever he talked about scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ensured Nam Joyoon ate an entire chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I attended a meeting regarding Neptune's album activities and only returned late at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Nam Joyoon's home, scenarios and scripts were stacked everywhere. There were some I found covered in dust in the boxes of synopses and others that I barely managed to obtain since their cast was already decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it didn't make me happy like it did Nam Joyoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I always read these while thinking about what would do well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before working in this industry, I too looked for my favorite movie and drama scenarios and scripts online. I could vaguely remember a time when my heart raced because of how entertaining a scenario was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did I feel when I read City Jungle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart did race thinking that this was going to be a smashing hit and even go to the Cannes Film Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a cold shower and laid down on my bed. I checked my phone to see messages I haven't read because I was at the meeting. Most were congratulatory messages about Neptune's consecutive hits in the music charts and schedule inquiries. While replying to each one, I discovered a familiar number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a long message. It started with a greeting, asking if I ate something nutritious because it was a dog day followed by praise about Neptune's album. Then she asked how everyone at W&amp;amp;U, including me, were doing before cautiously asking if Nam Joyoon had a chance to read the City Jungle scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hesitated for a good while with my fingers on the keyboard before kicking my blanket and getting up. It was going to be hard to get sleep with it being so hot and humid tonight, so I took the scenario that was carefully packed in an envelope out of my bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brewed a cup of coffee, returned to my bed, and turned on the floor lamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, I flipped the first page of the City Jungle scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ill-tempered artist, who felt like the world was a dry desert, met an unordinary woman one day. Following the woman and experiencing crimes and violence, the artist became motivated and inspired. He jumps into that world without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brooded over the scenario, which contained less than a hundred scenes. Some scenes were so terrifying that I had to brighten the lights, and there were other scenes that I read pacing in my room because I couldn't sit still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text formed images in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, the woman's face had become Lee Songha's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the artist's face was Nam Joyoon's. As though it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My phone was sent to voicemail once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recorded another message before immediately getting in my minivan. The film production company Forest. This production company, which Director Oh Hyunkyung mentioned was producing City Jungle, had its sign on the fifth-floor of a corner building in Chungmuro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joined others going to work and went on the elevator. What I saw the moment I got on the fifth floor were employees shrinking away with flustered faces and three angry individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film company CEO, who I had seen a picture of in an interview article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Director Oh Hyunkyung and Director Joo Jaechan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three were shouting angrily like they were about to grab each other by the collar at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Korean rental markets work a little differently. Basically, Nam Joyoon went from paying monthly rent to just providing a security deposit, which he gets back when he moves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:29:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 200-201</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78578/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 200: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (6)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung made the first move by bowing her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You must be surprised that I suddenly came over without contacting you. Sorry, but I felt this was urgent. I felt like it would take a long time to meet if I contacted you ahead of time. Busy people were normally like this. I'm really, really sorry!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gave off a much more cheerful impression than on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had short, round, tangerine hair and freckles on her cheeks. Her eyes curved into a slight smile, showing how sorry she was. I felt like there wouldn't be many who would rebuke her even if she suddenly came over without calling like now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pulled a chair and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First, please sit. But I was in the middle of work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, you're busy! I will explain everything in ten minutes. I'm a master of presentations. I actually came to discuss the scenario we talked about on the phone yesterday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung raised the scenario slightly before bringing it back down. I barely managed to prevent my eyes from reflexively chasing the scenario and forced them to look forward. Then, in an expression that showed I was neither interested or disinterested, I said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, that. City..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jungle! I really wanted to show it to you because you aren't the type that cares about trivial things like whether it's being produced by a major or minor production company and whether it's being directed by a star director or an unknown one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You worked with a debuting writer from a new production company for Cat Guardian Ghost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It had a timeslot with TVL, and Lee Songha was an unverified rookie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, Seo Jijoon, who chose Cat Guardian Ghost despite being a public network one-top male lead and having received many love calls for more well-known projects, was the type to only look at projects. Unlike me, Seo Jijoon didn't have the certainty that it would be a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, is that so? But even the projects you chose afterwards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would have been disastrous if Royal Family or Alive had flopped. That's why I was criticized for picking safe investments and accused of being scared of failing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung crinkled her nose as she laughed,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just tried to butter you up a little. Honestly, although all directors would say the same, I am certain that this movie will succeed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also certain of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is... if the owner changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turned my gaze to the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scenario played the biggest role in the success of a movie. Then what was the probability that a scenario, which succeeded under one director's leadership, would succeed with another director, who hadn't had a box office hit? Obviously, it was less than 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that you'll find it hard to believe. I'm not an appealing director. If I'm being honest, I heard similar things from investors. That they would think about investing if I handed the reigns over to another director."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One failure is the end these days. It really is difficult for a director who failed three times to get any investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have you thought about handing it over to another director?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, not at all. It's my project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung shook her head firmly. Her eyes shined with passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's something I created thinking would be my last movie. I spent a year fixing and polishing the scenario and tirelessly tried to persuade investors. Now, there are investors that I have had positive discussions with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung revealed a proud smile as she spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was curious where the scenario came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had initially considered the peaceful possibility that Director Joo Jaechan bought the rights to it from Director Oh Hyunkyung. However, after seeing her reaction on the phone and right now, she didn't seem like the type of person who would give it up easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan from the future had said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I had a hard time getting that scenario in my hands.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did he use a high-handed method?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors used to be an absolute authority in the past, but that was no longer the case. There were cases where they were chased out when their opinions clashed with production companies, and other cases where they were switched out for another director because they didn't fit the investors' preferences. There were even cases where they were rejected by actors. There weren't uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she said that that she didn't even think about changing directors... I didn't know about that. In a time where even mainstay directors were removed for various reasons, I wondered how long an unknown director would last under the pressure of those with investment capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mouth suddenly went dry. Something bothered me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the last future vision I saw was trying to say that I passed on City Jungle directed by Director Joo Jaechan despite knowing it would succeed... Then what was my reason behind it? Was it because of Director Oh Hyunkyung?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The engine's now running, so all we need to do now is drive. That's why we are in the process of casting our lead roles. Ms. Lee Songha..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing my expression, Director Oh Hyunkyung made a hearty laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know she's busy. Of course, I do. Mr. Seo Jijoon and Mr. Im Joowon are busy too. I know that too. To be honest, I was thinking about someone else from the beginning. I think he'll fit well with the image I've thought of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung pushed the scenario towards me as she said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would like to propose this to Mr. Nam Joyoon. As the male lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nam Joyoon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please have a look. I am confident I won't make you regret it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Director Oh Hyunkyung made her leave, I was left with the scenario in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I somewhat cleared my disorderly mind in the meeting room before getting up. I was about to go down the stairs with the envelope containing the scenario when someone followed me. He had curly hair, which reminded me of squid tentacles. It was Chief Yoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He glanced at the scenario and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your meeting seemed to run a little long. Are you perhaps interested in that project?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why? Are you interested in it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Yoon denied in an exaggerated manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was simply curious. I know that you have been looking at all sort of scenarios, but I was wondering if you had the leisure to spend time on movies that may or may not even make it to production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He coughed before whispering with a smile,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I was just wondering if it is really worth your time. People have been whispering about how you are acting like you're looking for scenarios and are, in fact, delaying making a decision because of the pressure of being a team leader. But who did that scenario come for? Ms. Lee Songha? Don't tell me it's Jijoon, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I also have something I'm curious about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About me? Well, if you have something, ask away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't you have work to do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Yoon abruptly stopped in his steps. He blinked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I-I am working? I have an audition for Director Kang Minshik's project in the afternoon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope you would spend the time spent on me on preparing for that audition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Yoon's face flushed red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went down the stairs. No one followed me this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got in my minivan. I glanced at the passenger's seat multiple time on my way home. It was the City Jungle scenario I had thought about countless times over the past few days. I tapped the steering wheel with the tips of my fingers. The traffic seemed to be especially slow today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had thought about slowly reading through it after returning home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I found myself parked in a nearby parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhaling, I picked up the envelope. I took out the scenario, and there was a colorful handout between its pages. It was a casting proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with a black-and-white photo of Nam Joyoon, Director Oh Hyunkyung wrote long, detailed, desperate, and embarrassing paragraphs on why she wanted Nam Joyoon as the male lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, I put the proposal back into the envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then flipped over the first page of the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something shook in front of me. It was thin, curly, and wet with something white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was cream pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why aren't you eating?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park asked as she waved a forkful of pasta in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, I was lost in my thoughts for a second."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your eyes are muddled. Maybe you're still not well? The director said that you could hand urgent matters to others and take a break. Why is someone who fainted and was in the hospital yesterday at work?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had something I had to handle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You lost your way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Back when you were a road manager... Back when you were always taking naps in the company sleeping quarters, you said that you would live like a human once you become a chief or a team leader. That you would enjoy your private life and take vacations. But why does it seem like you have less time now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did say that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a road manager, whose day started and ended with driving, I had thought that thing would get easier once I became a chief. When I was a chief, I had thought that I would be able to enjoy life more if I became a team leader. How was it that it felt like I was gradually becoming the company poltergeist?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Still, you reaped the rewards for your investments. Promotion and fame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park shrugged as she added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power, huh? It sounded so unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'll probably realize it as you work. Though, you probably won't need to realize any more fame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to avoid that now. After going to the hospital, my every move is being watched. I suffered all morning. I think if zombies somehow entered our company, they would receive less attention than me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that's why you wanted to talk outside than at work?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park looked through her eco-bag and took out a green envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo Jaechan. He received a mise en scène award at a short film festival not too long ago. Did you meet him then? I guess he left quite an impression?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I quietly looked into him, and it seems he's been receiving some love calls after receiving that award. They are more about commercials and music videos than movies though. However, it seems like Director Joo Jaechan wants to make a movie with his scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a historical drama called 'King's Warrior'. He's been going around looking for a company to produce it. He's been rejected by all the major ones and has been working to persuade smaller companies. Their reactions are lukewarm. I asked a production company he approached, and they say that the numbers just aren't there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park's eyes suddenly narrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't tell me you're interested in that scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's not it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I did slowly read through it with some expectations, it wasn't something that really caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a relief. If you were interested in that, I would have told you to go back to the hospital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park seriously seemed relieved as she let out a sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If not the scenario, are you interested in the director? Or are you interested in the short film that won the award? Do you want him to director Neptune or Pretty Girls' next music video? It's not like you're planning on giving a director who hasn't even made his debut a movie to direct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's actually similar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more I investigate, the more he doesn't seem like the kind of director you really want to work with..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park flinched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, with a face that seemed like pasta was caught in her throat, she stared at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's similar? You want to have this director direct a movie? No, wait."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her gaze scanned me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What kind of project is it? So you're interested in something? I did think that your expression seemed similar to when you bought Cat Guardian Ghost over. You made others wait in impatience. So what project are you interested in? Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park asked like she was dying to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll let you know once things are clear. It's too early to tell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why? Are you in the middle of tug-of-war with them? Problem with the role? Signing fee?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park, who kept asking questions, gulped down a cup of cold water as she asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then let me ask you one question. Who is the project for?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was the one who flinched this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Songha? Mr. Nam Joyoon? Jijoon? Mr. Im Joowon? Or Song Inho?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Leader Park's face approached mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 201: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whose work is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point brought up by Team Leader Park hung in my mind the entire night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as it was confirmed to be a hit, I wanted to show, not just the female lead, but the other lead to my actors. However, there was only one role and multiple people who came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An actor's future could hinge on a single project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who should I give a project guaranteed to be hit and who should I give a project likely to be a success? This was a consideration that I had never encountered back when I was only managing Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon. If there were other choices, I wouldn't have to think this hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However... Who was the actor originally picked to star in City Jungle in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I buried the thought that crept up my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it was more urgent to focus on what I know what could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I needed to handle the matter of ownership of the City Jungle scenario. I clearly laid out what I had to do. I created a straight path that would lead me to the future I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, before taking my first step, what I had been waiting for finally opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Taehee gave a longing look toward the Team 3 Leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just one glass. Just to ease the nerves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ease your nerves with beer or something. This isn't alcohol you open for any occasion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader, who was sitting in the living room sofa, hugged his glass bottle even harder. A moderately thick root was submerged in a long, slender bottle. This was the wild ginseng alcohol he had gifted Neptune every time they made some big accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the real deal. When I dug it up, I resolved myself to not open the bottle unless something incredible happened. I'll only open it if your songs line up on the music charts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girls' expressions became lukewarm when they heard him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Line up on the charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It referred to when the tracks of an influential singer's comeback album swept through the charts. There were even cases where boy groups with huge fandoms and great artists known for their hit songs had their tracks fill the top ranks for the charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was too difficult for us to dare dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internally, we would consider it a great success if at least three songs made it to the top of the charts. After a long discussion with the A&amp;amp;R Team about Lee Taehee's songs, we decided to go with a triple title track album. We spread our promotional marketing between them and even filmed three music videos, so I was inwardly hoping that all three would make it onto the first page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to take it back if we don't get a line up? Aren't you being too cruel?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung said with a face like she was looking at a scoundrel. A few voices chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He brought it over, but he's hesitant to give it to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung, is that really wild ginseng? It looks like a bellflower root."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment. Everyone was trying their best not to get their hopes up. Our goal was being a moderate success or something. Still, they kept looking at me for a while now, so my cheek muscles were about to spasm from maintaining my smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of people who would be frightened if my expression didn't look good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took out a can of beer from the fridge. Pulling the tab, I looked around the living room. Lee Kwanwoo was tirelessly refreshing the page on the laptop on top of the table. Neptune, the Team 3 Leader, and Kim Hyunjo were forcefully releasing their tensions while glancing in Lee Kwanwoo's direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, while all this was going on, Lee Songha was holding onto the script and scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am thinking about my next project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can think about that in a situation like this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha nodded seriously. Her eyes looked like they were looking at a hit list than projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to find a good project, so just wait."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, that's fine and all, but the album's out now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha hastily got up when she heard me. Immediately, an ear-piercing scream echoed in the living room. Someone was screaming while pointing their finger at their laptop screen. Someone else was screaming while waving their phone. Everyone's reaction was to scream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shook my beer can amidst their screams and sincerely laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader didn't hesitate to open the wild ginseng wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top three places on the music chart were all Neptune's songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is it uncomfortable?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No way. It's very comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could sitting in a Rolls Royce be uncomfortable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because you keep sighing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sighing because I'm uncomfortable. It's out of admiration because of how incredible the car is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, my body was comfortable, but my mind wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son Chaeyoung's uncomfortable words and the problems with the Team 2 Leader tangled in my head. This was despite the fact that Lee Songha explained how there was no problem with CEO Baek Hansung and CEO Baek Hansung had never mentioned the matter with the Team 2 Leader since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encountering him was uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should I buy you one?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The car."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung said lightly. Like he was giving out a piece of rice cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coughs erupted from my throat. It was a very enticing rice cake, but I didn't want it since it would be a headache to digest. It felt like I was taking out an extravagant loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I rejected his offer by saying that I loved and would continue to love the minivan I was driving now, the Rolls Royce arrived at our destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will lead you to the reserved room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We followed a Korean restaurant employee over an arched stone bridge. Fancy carps the size of my forearm leisurely swam in the pool below. A willow grew above it, completing the picturesque scene. Beyond the garden was a traditional Korean tiled rooftop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so extravagant that it could be called a palace than a restaurant. I had gone to many hotel restaurants, which I would never go to if I had to pay out of my own pocket, due to work, but the view here was the best. It was a bit of a waste to use it only as a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you thinking about to make that expression?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was thinking that we could sponsor this place for a historical film set."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung chuckled in a low voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There'll be many opportunities for you to come here from now on. This place has quite a few regulars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said whilst gesturing with his chin. Other guests were coming out the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were older men. Most of their faces were familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you know any of the faces there?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recognize most of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I had seen them in interview articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO of World B Pictures Korea, a movie production and distribution company. The director of the large entertainment, SoNaMoo. Besides them were executives, like CEOs and directors, from large and small management companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They seemed to have recognized CEO Baek Hansung as their pace quickened as they approached us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought I was mistaken, but have you come to nourish your health during these dog days?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems you've already eaten and are on your way out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would have great if we ate together. The timing wasn't good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the scales were different, they were all people who represented their respective companies. I didn't know what they were thinking inside, but they acted in a very friendly manner to CEO Baek Hansung. There were even a few who seemed to have a hard time approaching him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was enough to show CEO Baek Hansung's influence in our industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After greeting them, CEO Baek Hansung placed his hand on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, this is Team Leader Jung Sunwoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I greeted them, intrigued gazes landed on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, we know you. You are famous in our management industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hear it's because of you that W&amp;amp;U's image has been great these days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Th-that Neptune! People are talking about how great their songs are. Congratulations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed they had a few drinks while nourishing their bodies as their reactions were a bit exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I matched their ill-mannered remarks while thanking them. They say that you improve the more you do it. I seemed to have learned the ways of the world while working as it was easier to talk to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be great if I had someone like you working for me. If you have any thoughts of moving, contact me at any time. Don't worry about CEO Baek Hansung. Our company is growing so if you join now, you'll be one of our early employees. Our employee benefits are decent too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I didn't know how great their benefits were, reading the mood, I didn't think they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone's expressions became awkward when they heard the new management company CEO's words. They glanced at CEO Baek Hansung, who was talking to the World B Pictures Korea CEO.CEO Baek Hansung's gaze met eyes as he glossed over it with a laugh. Like he had heard a light joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, people treated the remark as a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need to make dibs based on the person!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can you even make dibs on CEO Baek's person? Especially a junior he personally brought here to nourish his health?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it was said in a joking manner, there seemed to be a meaning behind those jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We separated after saying our farewells. Behind us, the new management company CEO's voice was carried by the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't I make a joke?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need to watch the mood before you do. Team Leader Lee Jangyeob..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to listen in on them, but their voices quickly grew distant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You worked hard making Neptune's official album a success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung commented after we had finished half the samgyetang&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The girls, the Team 3 Leader, and Chief Kim Hyunjo worked harder than me. As well as other employees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was all Lee Taehee's work that the title track ended up so good. It was the Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo, who took the lead by saying that Lee Taehee's songs were great when I was uncertain of their success. The album was only complete with the collective hard work of the employees, including the A&amp;amp;R producer and PR Teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a good comment"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung nodded as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was thinking about talking to the PR Team and setting up a personal interview for you. What do you think?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A personal interview?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You talk about Neptune's album on behalf of the company. And about your next projects. Voices wondering how you've written a success story with no failures have even reached my ears. There are a lot of reporters who bluntly ask about you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said as though he was enjoying himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a few as well. Reporters who were more interested in my first project as a team leader and which actors would join it over Neptune's new songs. It seemed like the entertaining rumors of Midas's Hand were growing exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll get messy once reporters publish assumptions on what project you'll pick. Wouldn't it be better for you to do an interview before then? But you'll have to first decide on what your next project will be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His leisurely voice pushed my back forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a project I am considering serious. It'll..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"City Jungle?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My chopsticks slipped from the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told you there are no secrets in this industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CEO Baek Hansung lightly shrugged his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should forget about the project and look for a new one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've read a lot of scenarios. There will probably be some projects you've singled out. Discuss with the other chiefs and pick out around five projects. If you bring them to the next meeting, we should be able to pick one out, don't you think?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you say forget about City Jungle..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exactly as I said. I don't think it is suitable for your next project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said firmly. Only then did what CEO Baek Hansung said organize in my head. Yeah, I knew that there were many who would oppose City Jungle if I brought it up. It looked shabby compared to the other promising works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would have to persuade them eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put down my chopsticks and wet my throat with cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although it isn't an eye-catching project, the scenario is good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, I read it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He read it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was curious because it was something you were interested in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then... Did you not like the scenario? Although it doesn't meet the trends, it definitely is an entertaining project within its genre. Its production may seem uncertain, but once the cast is decided, there will be investors lining up, so there will be no concern it will be killed off due to a lack of investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would proceed even smoother if I used my fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that it has the highest potential for success amongst all the scenarios I have considered as my next project. I had thought that I couldn't lose Cat Guardian Ghost when I read it, and I get the same feeling from this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was trying to persuade him, CEO Baek Hansung calmly looked at me with a smiling face. He occasionally tapped the table with his fingertips as though he was reacting to my words. After a good while, he nodded his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scenario wasn't bad. Like you said, it isn't what's trending these days, but noir works are rare in the country and it'll be good to widen our actors' spectrum with its charming characters. It is worth taking the risk if the actor is willing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung continued to speak positively about it. He seemed like he was going to allow it, so his next words were more dumbfounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Still, look for another project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His voice and expression were still gentle, but his voice was firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did his trust in my judgment hit rock bottom because of rumors that I had a panic disorder? Or was he unhappy that I rejected Telepath, which he had personally mentioned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I thinking with a confused mind, CEO Baek Hansung tried to comfort me,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you really don't want to lose out on City Jungle, then hand it over to another team's chief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Another team? Why do I have to do that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't understand it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was it not okay if I wanted to do it, but okay for some other chief?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're in a situation where you should be stopping at nothing to find a project that will be a success. I'm just saying there's no need to pick a project with high risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He smiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because, Team Leader Jung, you cannot fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Chicken soup with ginseng and other medicinal ingredients. Considered a very nourishing dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:29:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 198-199</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78577/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 198: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn it. This was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it wasn't Director Joo Jaechan's scenario?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So it wasn't your scenario?"&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... Huh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did 'I' just speak?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words 'I' thought had come out of my future self's mouth. Without a single difference. Was it a coincidence? Was it just incredible timing? I gulped anxiously. I tasted the disgusting smell of alcohol from my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It felt like I had actually gulped just now. Was it also a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should try it once more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to speak whilst perking my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, my voice simply echoed in my mind. I tried again. I tried to talk to Director Joo Jaechan and singing the 'ABCs' and national anthem. I even shouted, but there was no sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn't any, but it was still different from before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breeze on my skin felt so real that it prickled my skin. My heartbeat quickened. My voice crawled up my throat, almost speaking, but failed at the last obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a little more, if I try a little more, maybe...!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't spout nonsense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My collar was involuntarily grabbed. Then I was pulled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's my scenario. It's fucking mine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan said in a seething voice right in front of me. The stench of alcohol overwhelmed me. Although he had looked like a man suffering from starvation and thirst, he suddenly looked satiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An odd case of madness lingered in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mine. My scenario...! It's mine now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lungs were suddenly filled with air. Struggling, I coughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You scared me!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Water, please have some water. Here!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, you made me bite my tongue!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung Uimin spoke one after each other. I instantly downed the cup of cold water Chief Jung handed me. I even crunched on the ice. Chief Lee Bongjoon, who stuck out his tongue with a frown, looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is it all of a sudden? Were you dreaming with your eyes open? Or did you see a ghost..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suddenly pushed the scenarios towards me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey- I mean, Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, what do you think will be a hit?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I just thought that he might be possessed or something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their voices muffled in my ears. My head felt like it had inflated like a balloon. I jolted to my feet with the mug. The chair fell back and crashed on the floor. Surprised, the two stopped whispering and stared at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had something caught in my throat. I'll be back after drinking some water."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah... Something was caught?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left the meeting room, leaving behind their disappointed faces. Employee's gazes stuck to me everywhere I walked. I went straight to the drinking fountain and drank multiple glasses of cold water, My mind cleared a little. I filled my empty cup as I thought things through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was that just now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only for a moment, but I felt a sense of realism from my future vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had never been like this before. Every time I saw the future, I was like a puppet. I couldn't do anything I wanted. The only things allowed were seeing, hearing, and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just now...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart raced so fast it felt like it would explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I could move the way I wanted in my future visions...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that was possible, I could make my family, celebrities, only walk a path of success. Whether it was a project, song, show, or anything else, I could figure out which would be successes and failures through my visions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, which celebrities would succeed or fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who would become my friend and who would be my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would be no need to try to piece the scraps of information obtained through my visions like now. I wouldn't need to worry and carefully examine every step I took either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the future... would be in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I filled my empty cup once more. I rinsed my overheated head with cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did this suddenly happen? Was there some sort of sign?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I thought about it, I had three future visions in the past few days. I met Director Joo Jaechan in two of them like the visions would guide me to Director Joo Jaechan and City Jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that I could change my future by getting them both and not have my next project flop and my nickname 'Midas's Hand' rust away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But... Wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three visions I had were full of static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why didn't my last future change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clear vision from twenty years in the future was always fixed no matter how I changed the present, but the static-filled ones changed as I changed the present. Like how I saw the vision where Jung Jae committed suicide after seeing the one where Pretty Girls succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing the futures with Director Joo Jaechan and City Jungle, I definitely decided to get them in my hands, but why did I still see a vision where I failed to get City Jungle? Why didn't it change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did it mean I tossed City Jungle away and picked a different one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Team Leader!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A voice pierced my ears. When I turned around, Lee Kwanwoo was standing there with a taken aback expression. Kim Hyunjo and the Team 3 Leader were also looking at me with bulging eyes. Other employees were gathered around me like they were seeing a spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader, are you all right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's wrong? Are you hurt?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Kwanwoo and Kim Hyunjo asked at the same time. I shook my head as I answered,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I'm fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're fine, why are you blankly standing there after breaking a cup?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked down. The floor was soaked, and the cup that had just been in my hand was shattered all over the floor. When did I drop it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, I must have been lost in my thoughts for a moment. I'll clean it up right away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved to find a broom or tissues when the floor disappeared. My vision turned black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't tell me, again?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The noisy employees were nowhere to be seen. All I saw in front of me was a window. It seemed to be night as it was dark outside. It was raining heavily. Lightning split the cloudy sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of vision was this? And where was I?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damn it, my head ached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mind jolted the moment I groaned and grabbed my forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My hand moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I unconsciously turned towards the voice before becoming shocked again. My head moved as well. My body moved at will. I raised my hands and waved them in front of me. I even tried bending each finger. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mind was a bit hazy and my body felt heavy, but my body was definitely moving at will. Excitement surged like a tidal wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My hands are moving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, are you okay? Why are you acting like that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ABCDEFG. Until that day when... I can even speak." &lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard a frightened voice. It was Lee Songha. Panic and worry were clearly evident on her face. I even saw Im Seoyoung, LJ, and Lee Taehee. They were all looking at me with oddly contorted expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha grabbed my hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could clearly see tears pooling in Im Seoyoung's eyes...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, why is there no static?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, you're scaring us! Can you see me? You know who I am, right? How many fingers am I holding up?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I blankly stared at the sobbing Im Seoyoung. Lee Songha quickly turned around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll go bring the nurse!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait, wait!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped the situation and looked around me. I was lying on a comfortable bed. There was a needle in my right arm, and I saw an IV to the side. The blanket on top of me was branded with the hospital name. I was in a hospital room. A private one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I clutched the bed as I raised myself up. My vision was still clear, with no sign of any static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the heck? Was this not the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I licked my dry lips and asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What day is it today?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tears finally fell from Im Seoyoung's eyes. At the same, Lee Songha ran out of the room, shouting for a nurse. LJ, who had a frown on her face, replied as she waved her hand in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You fainted after collapsing at work. Don't you remember?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did what?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I asked back, Lee Songha ran back in with a nurse in tow. I saw Lee Kwanwoo and Kim Hyunjo behind them. I left my body in the nurse's care as I heard the whole story. When I fell after stepping on the wet floor, I lost consciousness and was sent o the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh my god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You slept for half a day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo, with bags under his eyes, sighed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I talked to the doctor, and he said that you were fine aside from the few scratches you received when you fell. I didn't call your family since he said that you were probably just sleeping after fainting. The doctor said that it was probably sleep deprivation or exhaustion after hearing your work schedule."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, to have fainted at work...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't believe it...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung joined in. Her eyes were moist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's not fine. I think he hurt his head."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His head?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe he hit it when he fell? He was spouting nonsense as soon as he woke up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When even LJ joined the conversation, Kim Hyunjo tilted his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you talking about? He didn't his head."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ABCDEFG. Until that day when."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's what he said. Like he just woke up after being put under anesthesia. Shouldn't he be checked once more?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I quickly waved my hands when they started talking about MRIs and stuff. I told them that my mind was preoccupied because I had an incredibly vivid dream. Only after telling them that it was a nightmare where I couldn't see or speak like Helen Keller did the agitated mood finally calm down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sunwoo, you..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo paused in the middle of his sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Never mind. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Don't think about work tonight and just rest with the IV."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He patted my shoulder with a complicated expression before giving Neptune a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's just leave and not bother him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a little lon..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let him rest. You are also making a comeback the day after tomorrow. You have a ton to do right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girls whispered to each other for a while before lackadaisically walking out. They all seemed like they wanted to say something to me. Im Seoyoung spoke,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rest well, oppa. You don't need to worry about us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are so many people counting the days as they wait for us to release new songs. Since you've set it all up, how can the album fail- not do well? Everyone says that it'll be a minor hit at worst!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it flops, it's because my songs were lacking..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the will of the heavens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJ correct Lee Taehee after poking her sides. Im Seoyoung nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right! We need to blame the heavens!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what they said, but they all left with grim expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the other girls were leaving, Lee Songha approached me. Her face was still full of worry. There were also flashes of regret and guilt. Someone might think that I had a terminal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, you know how I said I would do any project you picked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... You did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to cancel that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Projects should be decided on by the actor and their manager."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha added as if to emphasize her intentions,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So it's not your fault if it fails."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was wondering why she was suddenly saying that...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Team leader, is it true you have a panic disorder?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Joowon whispered with a worried voice on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where did that nonsense come from?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Apparently, you suddenly went over to the water fountain while panting and downed six or seven cups of water consecutively. Your hands trembled before dropping your cup, and you fainted after trying to run away as people started to gather. Is that not it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was about to go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-That rumor is spreading in the company. That you developed a panic disorder from the pressure and anxiety now that you are suddenly managing so many people after becoming a team leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really felt like I was about to go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dissuaded him from visiting and hung up after telling him I was fine multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I checked my phone, and it was full of missed calls and messages. There was nothing more to say about the chiefs at work, but I also received some from Nam Joyoon, Seo Jijoon, Pretty Girls, and Song Inho. After looking through them, it seemed they had visited while I was unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I even saw Son Chaeyoung amongst the missed calls. I didn't know how far the rumors about my supposed panic disorder had spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I clicked my tongue and checked the remainder of my messages before pausing. There was a long message from an unknown number. I pressed the 'call' button as soon as I read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Hello?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone picked up as soon as it started to ring. It was a woman's voice. She seemed nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is this Director Oh Hyunkyung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Yes, this is Oh Hyunkyung. Is this perhaps Team Leader Jung Sunwoo...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, that's me. I'm calling you after reading your message. I wanted to learn more about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Ah, that is... I didn't know how you found out... But I heard that you talked about my scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your scenario?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She replied immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Yes, City Jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; The two lines are the same in Korean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt; I used 'ABC' over the Korean alphabet but used an English translation of the Korean national anthem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 199: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was only one scenario...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two people who claim it's theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Ah, was I wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung said in a flustered voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-To be honest, I was unsure when I received a call from Director Joo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo. Joo Jaechan. So they knew each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-City Jungle isn't a very common title, and I had only come up with it recently after thinking about it for the past few months. I also heard you mentioned the noir genre, which is what my project is. It all fit perfectly, so I was just wondering...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pieces all fit together, but the final picture was very odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-If I was mistaken then I'm really sorry. Please excus-!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said calmly so that I wouldn't have too high hopes or be too disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We talked while having a few drinks so my memory is hazy. The project came up while we were discussing minor genres. Hmm, I didn't know that it was your work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Pardon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her excited breaths suddenly stiffened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-... Did Director Joo Jaechan say it was his?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She reacted in a sensitive manner, like her precious egg was being threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without waiting for my reply, Director Oh Hyunkyung hastily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Then you've been tricked. City Jungle. Maybe not in the past, but now it's my work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I bought it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I twirled my phone in my hand before tossing it aside. Thunder rumbled outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dragged the IV stand over and opened the window. A fresh breeze and raindrops blew in, accompanied by the pitter-patter of rain. It was refreshing. I looked up at the sky, which seemed to want to wash the earth away, before sticking my head out the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She bought the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Director Joo Jaechan sold her his scenario and gave up all rights to the work, then there would be no problems with the law. Director Joo Jaechan would not be able to claim his right on the work either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, why was it back in Director Joo Jaechan's possession in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Director Joo Jaechan buy it back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing? That's dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone grabbed the back of my neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'll die if you fall from here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I saw a face covered with a black face mask. It was Seo Jijoon. While he pulled me away from the window from the back of my neck, Chief Lee Bongjoon closed the window. Just what outrageous thoughts were they thinking right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just taking in the breeze. Why would I fall?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At my words, Seo Jijoon tilted his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Out of impulse?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Am I crazy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked laughing, but there was no reply. Rather, Seo Jijoon's eyes turned slightly misty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told him the exact same words I told Im Joowon as I sat back down on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"there was no need for you to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I came because it was a rare opportunity for me to go out. I wanted to feel the breeze too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took off his mask and handed me a basket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a basket of roses. I wasn't even surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's bigger than last time. And redder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I paid special attention because it was a hospital visit. Ah, apparently, they don't gift flowers for hospital visits these days. It wasn't good for the patient. Allergies and such."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you know that, then why?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those are fake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are soap flowers. You can pick one out and use it when you're taking a bubble bath."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I'll use it well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I placed the flowers on top of the cabinet shelf. Chief Lee Bongjoon clicked his tongue as he said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you know how shocked I was when I heard that you fainted after going to get water and had to be brought out by an ambulance?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Probably less than me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you were suffering mentally, you should have let us know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm telling you that's not it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I did have various symptoms for mental illnesses, I didn't have a panic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Chief Lee Bongjoon and Seo Jijoon didn't look like they believed me. I had initially thought that those rumors were spread by those who didn't like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does it really look like there's something wrong with me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon rubbed the bridge of his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You look fine on the outside. If I were you, I would probably have a panic disorder, loss of appetite, and a mental breakdown? But you looked extremely normal even who the situation changed drastically after the Team 2 Leader left. I would have continued to think that if you didn't faint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was simply exhaustion and sleep deprivation..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not 'simply'. Whether it's exhaustion or sleep deprivation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying this, Chief Lee Bongjoon patted my arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be that you've been accumulating a lot of burden without you realizing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Jijoon said while scratching his neck,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I said I wanted to work with you, it wasn't because I had hopes that all my projects would be successes if I did. I'm not smart, but I'm not that senseless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon smirked. Seo Jijoon added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, I did think you'd have a better eye for projects than Bongjoon hyung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I came to tell you that you don't need to worry about it in case you felt burdened because of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seo Jijoon looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not like I'm going to retire after one or two projects. It's normal for there to be bad times and good times. I'll do what I can and leave the rest to the heavens. Also, above all..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His sharp eyes curved in a joking manner,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason why I wanted to work with you is simply because I thought it would be fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many people came to visit me even though I was only there for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon left, Nam Joyoon and Kim Hyunsup came to visit. Even Im Joowon visited after finishing his entertainment show schedule. Pretty Girls and Chief Lee Taeshin visited at night after coming all the way from Busan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rain calmed in the morning, and I looked back on the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although everything happened before I could even catch my breath. My relationship with the Team 2 Leader sharply deteriorated, and because he left the company, I was able to bring in people into my team faster and without any big obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I have no free time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed like it. Receiving the duties of a team leader, the number of meetings and discussions increased. There was a lot more I had to organize. On top of all that, I was absorbed in thinking about my actor's next projects and my future visions that there were a few days where I didn't sleep a wink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recalled Seo Jijoon's words. Kim Hyunjo had said it before too. That if I failed once, I could just succeed the next time. That my life wasn't over because I failed. I had thought that I had put down some pressure to succeed after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertain future visions kept tugging at my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just in case I saw a vision where the project I chose failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case I saw a vision where the project I rejected became a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case I would regret my decision like this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you ok-!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader, you have a guest?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm fin... A guest?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An employee nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She said her name was Director Oh Hyunkyung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Oh Hyunkyung?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I ended yesterday's call quite well, but why did she suddenly show up here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I frowned, the employee looked taken aback and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I brought her to a meeting room because she said she brought a movie scenario. I had thought that you had set up a meeting with her since she mentioned that she had talked to you on the phone yesterday. Was that not the case?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She brought a scenario?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should I say you have another meeting and send her back? Ah, but because the director came to see you, Chief Park and Chief Yoon went over to greet her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were the chiefs under Team 2. They were the prime suspects for spreading rumors about my panic disorder. They probably went over because they were interested than to greet her. In case it was a scenario I was interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events where Director Oh Hyunkyung came to see me and where she meets other chiefs were probably not in the original future. I had planned on walking the path and waiting for the project to come into my hands, but hiccups have already begun to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If things were headed in a direction I couldn't predict...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made my decision and asked the employee,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where is she?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting room was full. I saw Chief Park and Chief Yoon's bitter faces through the window. Chief Lee Bongjoon sat his round body right between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, you've come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon got up when he saw me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then we'll be on our way. Please enjoy your meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other chiefs reluctantly got up with even more bitter expressions under Chief Lee Bongjoon's prodding. Chief Park's gaze landed on the scenario on top of the table for a moment, but he left without much regret. After sending those two off first, Chief Lee Bongjoon whispered,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems she's here to promote her scenario. Why there are investors who pay attention if it's a scenario you're interested in. There are a lot of people who come to meet you with those motives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you see what kind of project it is?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard from her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked back at the meeting room as he clicked his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a stylish action noir. I'll have to read the scenario to know for sure, but from what I heard, it seems like it'll cost a lot to produce. A director who had numerous flops in the past and a small-scale production company. I don't know if they'll receive enough investments. I wonder if it'll even be produced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent Chief Lee Bongjoon off and entered the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman, who had been standing for a while now, was looking at me with a nervous smile. Her hands were tightly clutching her scenario. My gaze focused on the title page for a moment. Below the title 'City Jungle' was a clearly printed name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Script/Director: Oh Hyunkyung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be produced and become a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the owner changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:28:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 196-197</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78576/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 196: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"...! Please look over here!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sound of camera shutters pounded against my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The static was worse than normal, but I knew exactly where I was. Because the familiar short film photo wall was right in front of me, the photographers in front of the wall, and movie industry people walking around. I had just seen this same scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Isn't that Team Leader Jung Sunwoo?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gaze turned regardless of my will. The person who recognized me was familiar. He was the large investment/distribution agency general manager I had met in this exact spot around thirty minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was I looking at the past and not the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still in a state of confusion, my body bowed courteously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, why are you here? Are you here to check on rookies?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's that, and I thought I could discuss our actors' next projects with directors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah... Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this wasn't the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same short film festival closing ceremony. At the same location. But it was a few years in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo, you know Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do. This feels different. We had met in this exact place a year ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man next to the general manager spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was the first time I received an award after entering my short film. I was so discouraged that I couldn't even meet your gaze."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His hair was styled, and his face had makeup on. He wore a nice suit. If I didn't hear that he was a director, I would have thought he was a celebrity considering how much attention he spent on his appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo. Who was he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flipped through my memories until I finally recalled who he was. He was the face I had just seen. The unknown director I had been introduced to by the production employee. The one who entered the competition. Just looking at his appearance, he looked like a completely different person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that he saw me a year ago... Does this mean this is a year from the present?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was there something like that? You can look at him in his eyes all you want now. You're not the same Director Joo as before. No need to be discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general manager encouraged the young director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You made a box office hit with your debut movie, a non-mainstream with a noir feel, and won rookie director and screenplay awards. You even attended Cannes. People are remarking how your next project is the most anticipated right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My ears perked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had spent five years working on just the scenario for this project, so my next will be a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A project that is bound to fail will fail even if you work on it for five, even ten years. A film like this was born because you put your life on the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart had started to race the moment this vision began, but it felt like my clogged vessels had busted open and fresh blood was flowing through my veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he attended Cannes, then it meant his film was good regardless of the actors or distribution agency. I should have a proper conversation with him once this vision was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A project he had been working on for five years. On top of that, if the movie released within a year from the present, then at the latest, he would probably start filming within the next couple months. His scenario was likely complete by now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My body shuddered because of how much I wanted to read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of film would it be? Just as I wished I could at least hear what it was called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo! City Jungle was a lot of fun. It was too polished for your first project?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer just rolled in. People from production companies came over and began chatting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was I getting information so easily this time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It made me wonder if I was daydreaming instead of seeing the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just then, my vision flipped. So it wasn't a daydream. It was my first time being relieved by getting kicked out of a vision. I blinked to adjust to my suddenly changed vision, but my vision was still filled with static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in a different place now. I heard the sound of meat sizzling and clinking glasses. Was I in a restaurant? A banquet hall? Anyways, this wasn't the present. It was another vision of the future. While surprised, my feet were moving. It seemed I had quite a bit to drink as my body staggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I opened the door, I was met with a warm night breeze. It was summer. Just as I took a step out,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did you see Team Leader Jung's expression when we met today? He looked like he had stepped in shit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why wouldn't he? I bet his stomach aches whenever he sees Director Joo's face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My steps halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three red faces were smoking in front of the brilliantly lit sign. They were the production people I had seen in the previous vision as well as in the present. They wore the same outfit as the previous vision. So this was the afterparty of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the situation, I perked my ears because I thought they were talking about me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who? Team Leader Jung Sunwoo? What about him?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you not know? Apparently, Team Leader Jung was the first person Director Joo showed City Jungle to. I heard that he even went to his home to ask for Lee Songha to be the female lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huh, then his stomach wouldn't just ache, it must be lurching at the sight of him. If he went with that project, Lee Songha wouldn't have a flaw in her filmography, and Team Leader Jung Sunwoo would have continued to be well off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flaw in Lee Songha's filmography? I would have continued to be well off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's what I'm saying. He thought long and hard before coming to a decision, yet the project he chose completely flopped. And the project he rejected because it was a rookie director's first film became a hit. There was just a lot of empty hubbub about him being Midas's Hand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Midas's Hand. It's been a long time since I last heard that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their chuckles and laughed ground my ears. Although I didn't have a sip of alcohol, flames ignited in my stomach. Flopped? The project I thought long and hard before deciding flopped? What project did I end up choosing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I should focus on not missing a single word...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, I heard Team Leader Jung fell out of favor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are even rumors that he's being pushed aside since W&amp;amp;U is recruiting another team leader and other rumors about how he fell out of CEO Baek Hansung's favor and was demoted to back to chief. Either way, his current predicament isn't very good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung Sunwoo, wasn't CEO Baek the one who promoted him to team leader?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess he found out that he wasn't team leader material after promoting him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't even have time to think as my legs just moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He acted arrogantly like he wouldn't be successful for the next ten thousand years, yet look at him no..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have something you're curious about me, then just ask me directly. Instead of spouting nonsense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such sarcastic remarks came out of my mouth. A man who was exhaling cigarette smoke coughed loudly. His expression momentarily flashed with shock before he wiped it from his face. He said in a mocking tone,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I mean I'm sorry that we talked about you behind your back, but it's not nonsense. Someone might think that I was making it all up. I heard this from someone at W&amp;amp;U."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't tell you. Anyways, rumors have spread internally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That Team Leader Jung Sunwoo is a kite with a broken string."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard loud clapping. I blinked my dry eyes. My vision was no longer filled with static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who waving his award and bouquet in front of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw his work, and it was filmed well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone struck a conversation next to me. Still a little out of it, I turned my head and frowned. The person who said I saw a kite with a broken string was sitting next to me. I barely managed to contain my urged to shove his approaching face away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, are you perhaps interested in rookie director's works?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spoke with a smile on his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why there are cases where one's debut work is a huge hit. Those who wait a long time to debut and put their life on the line when the opportunity arises. Our company is looking for rookie directors like that, so if you are interested..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fixed my gaze in front of me. I kept recalling his words, so I felt like my hand would strike out if I kept looking at his face. An unfamiliar man, clearly moved, was giving his award speech at the podium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While acting like I was listening carefully, I organized the information in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I obtained a lot of information this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now knew that the project I would choose would flop and that it would be a flaw in Lee Songha's filmography. It was also possible that matters other than that also didn't work out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I couldn't be sure, I also knew that unpleasant rumors about me would also spread in W&amp;amp;U.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So all this would happen in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My future looked great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rubbed my face when Im Seoyoung poked my side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, it's Lee Songha's turn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I raised my head, Lee Songha was handing a bouquet to another award winner. Applause soon broke out. I mechanically clapped before stopped. Then I scanned the winner. A young man who hugged the bouquet in a stooped position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo Jaechan. We will now listen to his award speech."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joo Jaechan. Director Joo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I had obtained some good news before getting beat up about all this bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what project I choose in the future that will flop, it hasn't occurred yet. I could simply change the future like how I saved Royal Family, which had been about to flop due to a drug scandal. I had all the information I needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just needed to grab ahold of the opportunity that found its way in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended the afterparty after watching all the winning works after the closing ceremony. The location was an outdoor banquet hall, different from the one I saw in the future. While I went around clinking glasses with people, my gaze soon fixed in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan was sitting at a table with the unknown actors who appeared in his work. The actors went around, trying to network, but Director Joo Chaeyoung sat stiffly like a turtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't sure if he was just too shy or had no intentions of marketing himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recalling his appearance in the future, he didn't seem like the shy type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, he was hugging a clunky backpack while downing glasses of soju. He occasionally glanced at other winners who were receiving attention from production companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan had received a mise en scène award. Since it was an award given to works with great visual arts and expression, he would receive less attention from production companies than the grand award or best work award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Congratulations on your award."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thank... Oh, hello!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan stumbled to his feet when he saw my face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is there a spare seat?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, of course. Please sit anywhere!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I sat down, I raised a bottle of soju. Director Joo Jaechan quickly downed the glass of soju I poured for him. Half of it dripped on his clothes. I refilled his glass, and he poured me a glass as well. I would get to the point after buttering him up with small talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is there a scenario you are preparing for a feature-length film?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went straight to the point... Forget butting him up, I couldn't contain myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;".... A scenario?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, a feature-length film. I was wondering if I could take a look if you did have one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan, who blankly looked at me as if wondering why I was asking, moved his pupils. Soon, his face ignited with anticipation. The moment he was about to speak, someone grabbed my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team Leader Jung, if you ask that, our rookie director here won't be able to sleep tonight from the anticipation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the person who introduced me to Director Joo Jaechang. He seemed to be quite drunk as he was starting to slur his words. He placed one of his heavy arms on my shoulder and the other on Director Joo Jaechan's shoulder before saying,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Joo. Don't get ahead of yourself and just show him. Relax. Team Leader Jung here is obsessed with scenarios. I heard he reads scenarios to proposals no matter if they were from a pro or an amateur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ahh..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flames in Director Joo Jaechan's eyes dwindled slightly. He opened his backpack with a bashful expression. He seemed to have been prepared for situations like this as he took out a neatly bounded scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I unconsciously gulped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Err, this is a scenario I've been working on for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't polished enough that I can show it off confidently..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though he said that, his hands showed no hesitation in handing me the scenario. I checked the title as soon as I received it. I flipped the pages and skimmed through the plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I asked Director Joo Jaechan,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Is this all?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon? Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even proposals?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the only feature-length film I've been preparing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked down at the scenario again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I knew, the title of his work was City Jungle, and it was a noir flick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was this one completely different?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 197: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'King's Warrior.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large characters in front of me didn't change even after blinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened my dry lips and asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And the genre is..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A historical drama."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's right. Since there are a king and his warrior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flipped through a few more pages before closing it. In no way was this similar to the noir genre or the 'City Jungle' title. The only similarity was that both films had four characters in their name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked in a gentle tone,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have short film scenarios or synopses, could I take a look?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He might have restricted a short film to be a feature film, but he struck down my hope. I examined every short film scenario and synopsis that came out of Director Joo Jaechan's backpack, but I couldn't find a hint of what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have been preparing for this feature film for a long time?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I've worked on it for more than two years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then where did the scenario he worked five years on suddenly appear from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This really was strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is this historical drama your first feature-length work?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Yes, it is my first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan said dispiritedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems you are unhappy with all of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, that's not it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your expression has gradually been growing worse. This is all I have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did that scenario have a different writer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn't seem to be the case. They definitely said he won best screenplay, and he himself said it was a project he had been working on for five years. The investment/distribution agency general manager had praised Director Joo Jaechan from start to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was Director Joo Jaechan lying to me right now? If so, why? It might have been easier to understand the situation if I knew the production company in charge of City Jungle. Where did he make the movie?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suddenly looked next to me. The drunk production company employee was looking at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I casually exchanged a few more drinks before looking at them and asking,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you planning on doing another project together?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huh? No, no, nothing's decided. If he does have a good project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He avoided the subject. Then he patted Director Joo Jaechan's shoulder,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't promote that historical drama, okay? How can we let a rookie director direct a historical drama? It needs a large budget and it's difficult to get investments for. If the cast is good, we might be able to trust the actors enough to follow through, but you know that rookie directors have a hard time casting actors, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He glanced at me while saying that. He looked like he would be interested in a talented actor was interested even if it was a historical drama. I simply laughed it off. After examining my reaction a bit longer, he seemed to think it was a fruitless endeavor and got up after emptying his glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Write something besides historical dramas. A comedy seems good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving those words, he went over to a table where other directors were sitting at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drank while looking at Director Joo Jaechan. Maybe it was because he was a little depressed, but he didn't give off much of an impression either. Director Joo gave off a showy impression in the future. Did he change after his debut work became a hit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or was he simply acting well-behaved right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The afterparty reached its peak as more people were making a racket. I met a few people before going back to Director Joo Jaechan's table multiple times. Also, I confirmed a few more things once he was completely drunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether he really didn't have another work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether he was interested in the noir genre. I even mentioned City Jungle. However, even as he was nodding off while drunk, he simply shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it, I organized my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's wait for now. Acting hastily now could change the future. Since, in the future, they said that Director Joo Jaechan brought the scenario to me first, it would be best not to change anything if I wanted that future to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I handed Director Joo Jaechan my business card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with a message, asking him to contact me whenever he had a good project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I decided to wait and see, my surroundings move quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Have you seen the article?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I'm reading it right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Lee Songha, Her next work is 'Supernatural' with Heo Kakyung.}&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Movie 'Supernatural' casts Heo Kakyung and Lee Songha among others}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It seems the ones from Supernatural leaked this. You want to release a correction, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-We're writing a press release. Are you still considering the scenario or is it final?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's final. We formally refused in our meeting yesterday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, that was what I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It seems that they didn't get that memo. Or they are thinking about using this to promote their movie since negotiations have failed. And they clearly know this puts us in a difficult spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hanging up my call with Team Leader Park, I asked Reporter Park Woojeong as well. Then I refreshed the page as I waited for the correction to be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a common tactic to release an article while things were still undecided, but I didn't have the time to just laugh it off this time. It would complicate things if Director Joo Jaechan went elsewhere after seeing this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept refreshing the page when I received a call. It was from the 'Supernatural' people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"General manager."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Ah, I saw that an article confirming Ms. Lee Songha was released?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, it did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-We're not the ones who released it. Just in case there's a misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean you didn't release it? Such a blatant lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I clicked my tongue as I refreshed the page. As soon as I saw the top headline, my tensed lips relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{Lee Songha's Side denies being cast in 'Supernatural'. Formal Refusal (Official Stance)}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-This is very awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's okay. We released a correction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Pardon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other side because busy. I also refreshed the page. The correction seemed to be spreading well as a few more articles with similar headlines were published. Not long after, I heard a sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It's your official stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt that it would be best clearly settle the matter since an article was released. If Lee Songha keeps getting mentioned in Supernatural articles, it would make it difficult for you to cast other actresses. We really are thankful for your proposal, but next..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Team Leader Jung Sunwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unhappy voice suddenly cut in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director Cha Jaeho?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Yeah, it's me. I have never sent love calls or made script adjustments for young actresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-page adjustment proposal that would obviously be ignored once we signed the contract. I was curious when the director, who was too proud to allow even adlibbed lines, meant by adjustments, but it was as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I could reply, Director Cha Jaeho sarcastically said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-It seems that Midas's Hand really didn't like my project. Please let me know when you decide on Ms. Lee Songha's next project. I'm curious what amazing project you'll join after rejecting mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jung Sunwoo!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director sat on my desk. His brows, which were the only sharp features on his round face, twitched. The director stopped calling me Lucky Charm after that day with the Team 2 Leader. Instead, he looked at me like I was a headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did Director Cha Jaeho swear at you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He didn't...."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he did make a ton of sarcastic remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said that I would regret it later. That he will be waiting to see what I pick after rejecting him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tell him to get in line. Even the CEO is waiting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CEO is?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said that he was very interested in what kind of project you will bring in the future once he saw the article."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm curious too. Just what is inside your head."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City Jungle was in my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was curious where that scenario was hiding, and I was curious what Director Joo Jaechan was doing, if he had eaten, if he was thinking of me, and when he would come to see me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While thinking these stalkerish thoughts, I suddenly saw the director's face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would he react if I mentioned Director Joo Jaechan and City Jungle to him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only experience he had was being an assistant director and winning an award at a short film festival. He was still a director who had yet to make his debut. And right now, it was uncertain who would produce and invest in it. If I was frank with him, I wonder if he would hit me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I was confident in persuading him about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I knew that it would be a success. Like Cat Guardian Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was confident in persuading him, but the problem was that the whereabouts of the scenario was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyways, you need to guard your position. Make sure you're not emptying your office as soon as you move into it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director got down from my desk. Then he looked at me up and down before clicking his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not just Lee Songha, you'll now have multiple actors asking for projects. The CEO says to let you be since he trusts your incredible eye. However, remember that the failure of a team leader is on another level from a chief failing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mumbling director looked back at me with a strange expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know that the actors will falter too if you do, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few scenarios and proposals were evenly spread on top of the meeting room table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Lee Bongjoon and Chief Sung Uimin put their heads together,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that this script is good, but Jijoon is showing no interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who else have they sent the script to besides Jijoon? I want to show Joowon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they sent one to Yoon Taekyung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stared at the thick stacks of paper. They were projects we had examined and picked. They were projects I had read while thinking about Lee Songha's next project. Objectively good choices with good synopsis, directors, and writers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'He thought long and hard before coming to a decision, yet the project he chose completely flopped.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remark I heard in the future rang in my mind. If I had heard which project I had chosen, I would have avoided that one. Now, they all looked like flops. I felt like I was going crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good projects. Good projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would do anything to get actors good projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thoughts naturally turned to City Jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Director Joo Jaechan hadn't decided on actors, what if I proposed other actors besides Lee Songha for other roles? I wouldn't be able to tell until I saw the scenario. That damn scenario. I needed to check it...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next moment, my vision went black. My vision was filled with static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again? A future vision again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My vision was so dark that I couldn't see in front of me. Ah, my eyes were closed. I could feel my eyes moving underneath my eyelids. I heard noises from the distance, and the stuffy scent of cigarettes flowed into my nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you regret it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone beside me asked. Only then did my future self open his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was sitting on a cement floor. I saw a pair of legs leaning against the wall. When I lifted my gaze, I saw Director Joo Jaechan exhaling cigarette smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than the depressed, shy Director Joo Jaechan, this was the aloof Director Joo Jaechan from the future, who wore fancy suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this still the afterparty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw two visions one after another last time. This really was strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you rejected my project because I hadn't made my debut as a director yet. I was wondering if you regretted it now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan asked again, urging me to respond. He seemed drunk as he was slurring his words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I pushed aside my questions and perked my ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't reject you because it was your debuting work. It conflicted with another project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, that. The flop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan threw his cigarette butt into the outdoor ashtray as he chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My future self said in a low voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyways, I do regret it. I had fun watching it. The plot was good, and so were the characters. It would have been great if Lee Songha had been the female lead. I made the wrong choice at that time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plot was good, and so were the roles? What a relief. I was a bit worried that the female lead would have little presence like Supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's refreshing that you regret it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan chuckled again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you were going to regret it, it would have been good for both of us if you had just done it when I begged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told you that the scenario was good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I perked my ears in hopes of gaining a hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Joo Jaechan mumbled,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a hard time getting that scenario in my hands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting it in your hands?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; So the author previously wrote 'Telepathy'. Here, he goes with 'Supernatural Human', which I shorted to 'Supernatural'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:28:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 194-195</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78575/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 194: A Way that Suited Me (6)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seo Jijoon and Im Joo..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director groaned. His words were cut off by a sigh. He rubbed his temples as he mumbled, 'Oh, what a headache.' The way he looked at me changed. It was as though I was a pain in the neck instead of a lucky charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jung Sunwoo. You need to calm down. I think you just said that without thinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tried to reason with me. His attitude was different from his normally not-so-serious self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I glanced next to me. The one who needed to calm down seemed to be someone else. The Team 2 Leader's face was dark. He glared at me with a menacing look. If he could kill with his gaze, my body would have been torn off limb by limb and scattered on the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand how you feel. I get it, but if you're going to stir trouble, it should be within your capabilities. How do you plan on dealing with the aftermath if you take them with you? Are you crazy?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was shockingly calm right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I would have trouble breathing or my hands would be shaking once I said those words, but it came out so nonchalantly as if I was deciding what I was going to eat for dinner. My body and mind moved naturally like a stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining my reaction, the director shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's act like that didn't happen. Let's do that, CEO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, personally check with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than agreeing with him, CEO Baek Hansung replied with an order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Check?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon's opinion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken aback, the director's butt jolted. I also flinched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had thought that they wouldn't outright reject the idea if Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon revealed their intentions to join my team since companies tended to cater to actors on their level. However, I didn't think it would proceed so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had thought he would ask something more from me. His actions made me wonder if the Team 2 Leader had fallen out of CEO Baek Hansung's favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave CEO Baek Hansung a doubtful look. Our eyes met. Like the director, he also looked at me differently. On one hand, it looked like he was watching an amateur's cute actions, but on the other hand, it looked like he was pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, it seemed like he had hoped I would act like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked at me and Song Inho before gesturing with his chin,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You two should step out. I think the Team 2 Leader and I need to have a talk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader was silent. His gaze simply stabbed at my back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brushed my seat and got up. After saying goodbye, I brought Song Inho out of the CEO's office. I was walking while guessing at what kind of conversation would take place when I didn't hear any footsteps following me. I turned around, and Song Inho wasn't unable to regain his senses like he was being washed down a current. His no longer tearful face looked dazed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung, is this all? Is it fine like this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll have to make it fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lightly raised my shoulders when the CEO's office burst open. The Team 2 Leader rushed at me like a mad boar. Just as I thought he was going to hit me, I was hit with his fist. Another fist made its way towards me as I faltered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team 2 Leader!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't plan on getting hit twice without making a sound. I quickly pulled my head back. The Team 2 Leader's fist narrowly brushed passed the bridge of my nose. Song Inho and the director rushed over when I grabbed his arm. Then they grabbed the Team 2 Leader's shoulders and pulled him off me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pressed my aching cheek and swallowed. There was a disgusting taste in my mouth. Maybe something ripped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hyung, are you all right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader stopped Song Inho, who was coming over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Song Inho! What's your problem? What did I not do for you?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there was something you didn't like, you should have said so. What are you doing?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho's face distorted miserably. The Team 2 Leader continued to shout,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you think I'll let you or that bastard off after suffering like this? I told you that this industry was small. Do you think good rumors will spread about a guy who abandons his benefactor as soon as he makes it big? Worthless personal...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rumors should be that the actors were moved during an internal restructuring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I replied while taking a step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's the rising star of W&amp;amp;U. Weird rumors won't be good for the company either. It'll make things difficult for the PR Team. Also, even if he changes teams, he's still part of the W&amp;amp;U family. I don't think you should say things like not letting him off no matter how angry you are..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threats had to be made by the right person in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, wouldn't that be best for you as well?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it was just Inho, maybe there would have been rumors about his personality or something, but if three move teams, wouldn't it look like you are the problem? This industry is a small place. You would lose face if some weird rumors spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You bastard!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader's mood grew more dangerous. The director, who gestured to me to act moderately from the back, eventually facepalmed. He steadfastly held onto the Team 2 Leader's shoulders as though he was worried punches would fly again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huffing, the Team 2 Leader glared at Song Inho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know how he persuaded you, but don't think...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I begged him to take me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho said in a subdued voice. The Team 2 Leader flinched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My problem? I told you countless times, yet how can you not know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho let out a frustrated sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't follow your methods. I'm suffocating. Like you said, I'm scared that rumors about how ungrateful I am will spread. However, if I stay with you, I feel like I will come to hate acting. That scares me more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more he spoke, the more heavily the Team 2 Leader huffed. He looked like he didn't know what to do with all the shame, betrayal, and rage he felt. The director clicked his tongue and signaled me with his eyes. I took Song Inho and got in the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as the doors began to close, Song Inho collapsed against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I should be asking you that, hyung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw the Team 2 Leader between the closing doors. He was glaring at me without taking a single step. I stared back at him. His face distorted even more. Soon, the elevator began to move. Rather than the Team 2 Leader's face, the shiny elevator doors reflected my face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My face looked refreshed like I had been reborn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho threw away all his grief after a drink. He was crawling around my living room when I grabbed him and flopped him down on my bed. I struggled a lot because he wouldn't let go of my ankle. The world had become quiet by the time I was able to wrap him up in my blanket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I emptied the remaining contents of the bottle. My mind was still sober even though I poured down liquor like it was water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only my heart seemed to beat more loudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked out my window, which reflected the streetlights and neon signs outside, before calling someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Who is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's me, mom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Ah, I had forgotten I even had a second son. Do you know how long it's been since you last called?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her voice hid her sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Has it been a while?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-A while? It's been harder to hear your voice than when you went to mandatory military service. Your father lets you off, saying that no news is good news and that it's good that you're busy, but this is excessive. You're obviously busy during the week. Busy on weekends and holidays. Are you the only one that's this busy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all are. Sorry, I'll try my best to come down for Thanksgiving."&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said while checking my calendar. Would I be able to take a day or two off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-How are you? Are you stressed at work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I did clear away a man who was stressing me out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm fine. Ah right, I've been promoted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Promoted? To what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom's dazed voice went up a pitch. Chewing on octopus tentacles, I framed the events leading up to my promotion in a good way. My mom listened for a good while before she said in a serious voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Okay, I'll keep this to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't matter if others know. This isn't a secret."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Really? I've become used to watching what I say after you appeared on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom laughed awkwardly before adding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Though I am happy that you're appearing on TV because you're successful and being promoted for doing a good job, do most people get promoted this quickly? The higher up you are, the more responsibilities you take on. I'm worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I wouldn't have accepted if I didn't think I could handle it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-If things are tough, talk to your brother. If it's still not resolved, then come down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom, who was advising me, suddenly laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I'll pass you the phone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huh?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Your father's pestering me, knowing that I'm about to hang up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I unconsciously smiled. After talking with my father, I decided to call my brother. I chatted with the quadruplets for an hour on speakerphone. I had thought that no other life was as dynamic as mine, but the quadruplets didn't lose out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After them, I called Neptune, then Seo Jijoon and Chief Lee Bongjoon as well as Im Joowon and Chief Sung. I think I heard that I was crazy at least fifty times while explaining what happened today. In fact, one of them even messaged me saying that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I laid down on my sofa early in the morning. Then I flipped through the scenario I had started reading the night before. My mind filled up as I thought about Song Inho, Seo Jijoon, and Im Joowon's roles on top of Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was at it, I brought out all the scenarios, drama proposals, and scripts. I cleared away the liquor bottles and side dishes from the living room table and spread out the actors' photos and posters. Then I looked at each of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sleepless yet satisfying night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arrived back in Seoul after a three-day business trip to China. As soon as I left the airport, I was met with hot, stuffy air. It seemed the heat wave had arrived because my back became soaked even though I wore a t-shirt. Even the people walking on the streets looked somewhat withered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thirst burned my throat by the time I arrived at the company. I should buy a drink from a vending machine. No, an ice dispenser would be better. I got out the elevator thinking this and saw the lounge crawling with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, hello, Team Leader Jung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood was uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way they were whispering to each other before going silent as soon as I got off the elevator. The way they staggered and nervously greeted me. Above all, the people who were calling me 'Team Leader Jung' were Team 2 chiefs who had recently disregarded me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had the incident with the Team 2 Leader surfaced?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for someone to ask when the Team 3 Leader called me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Let's meet as soon as you arrive at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm already here. I'm in the lounge right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo popped out of the office immediately after I said that. Then they each grabbed my arm and dragged me into an empty meeting room. Other employee's gazes followed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's with the mood? Is it because of the incident with the Team 2 Leader?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no answer. Instead, I looked at the two sitting in their seats. They looked baffled. As they were well aware of what happened between me and the Team 2 Leader, they shouldn't be this agitated because of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Team 2 Leader handed in his resignation letter this weekend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Resignation letter?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recalled the Team 2 Leader's face, which I had last seen in front of the CEO's office. I had thought he would be up to something, but a resignation letter? He just up and left the company? What did he discuss with CEO Baek Hansung that day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wasn't a threat or anything?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought the same thing when I first heard it too, but it's not. He received investments from China and is apparently planning on becoming independent. He said he had already discussed with his 'children', so he would take those whose contracts were almost up with him. Even excluding top stars like Son Chaeyoung and Jijoon, there are quite a few actors he had brought in."&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's right. They made up the core of W&amp;amp;U's lineup of actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actors like Song Inho and Seo Jijoon, who didn't align with the Team 2 Leader's methods, were a minority. The majority of actors whom the Team 2 Leader brought in from the free agency market approved of the Team 2 Leader's methods and skills. Like Son Chaeyoung in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the type who seemed sensitive to betrayal after being stabbed in the back like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that he would turn his back on CEO Baek Hansung and take the actors who followed him with him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So? Did he actually leave?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo said, astonished, as though even he couldn't believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader, who was quietly sitting there with his arms crossed, added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He left alone. I don't know if talks didn't go well or something didn't go as planned at the end, but the actors who were supposed to leave with the Team 2 Leader remained. That's why the Team 2 Leader barged into the CEO's office not long ago and caused a huge commotion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo asked the Team 3 Leader,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you think he'll come back?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if he's received investments, without any trustworthy actors, won't he just waste away? Rumors will spread that he left the company on bad terms. Even if the CEO doesn't do anything, others will be cautious. Do you think actors will sign with him?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's probably done trying to make a place for himself in the country. If he goes to China though, he'll probably at least make a living."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader scratched his disheveled hair. He checked the firmly shut door before leaning towards me. Then he asked in a quiet voice,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey, you've also been offered investments from China, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Does the CEO know that too?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; FYI, Korean Thanksgiving is in September&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{2}&lt;/sup&gt; Remember, the Team 2 Leader treats actors like they are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 195: Stop at Nothing, By Any Means (1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like cold water had been poured on my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did CEO Baek Hansung know that I received an investment proposal in China?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Team leader, how did you know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I for one wasn't the type to chat about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lee Lyang."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That guy seems to be really interested in you. I guessed when we went for drinks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a representative of a Chinese agency company. I recalled his neat and urban face. His voice in which he proposed I leave W&amp;amp;U and go independent with Chinese investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I curtly replied,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That happened a year ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I refused his proposal then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard that too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, I didn't regret my decision. I didn't plan on leaving W&amp;amp;U any time soon, and the foresight I had seen at the time made me uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I met Lee Lyang on business trips to China, he would bring the proposal up in the passing, but talks never progressed. He even stopped mentioning it recently. This was something I had tossed in the corner of my mind until recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader rubbed his chin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO has never brought up any talks about investments, has he?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Never."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then that's fine. I was going to advise you to save yourself if the CEO happened to know about it. I was worried that sparks would fly to you because the Team 2 Leader created this wreck after accepting Chinese investments. If the CEO doesn't know, then that's that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If CEO Baek Hansung doesn't know...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I say for certain that he doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you've noticed, then the CEO might also..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, Lee Lyang brought it up only because he was with me. He won't say a word in front of the CEO. If the CEO knew that such talks were ongoing beneath the surface, he would immediately change the agency we work with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 3 Leader waved his hand. Kim Hyunjo, who was listening with a serious expression, joined in,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wouldn't it be better to tell the CEO that something like this happened and that he refused? It just makes me feel uneasy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know about that. There's no need to bother the CEO about something that's already in the past. Especially at a time like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, it really isn't a good time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Hyunjo scratched his head as he looked up at the ceiling. My phone on the table began to ring. I flinched when I saw the caller. The Team 3 Leader and Kim Hyunjo flinched in shock at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was CEO Baek Hansung. What kind of timing was this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Hello?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I heard that you've arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spoke slowly. It was difficult to gauge his mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, I arrived not too long ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Shall we meet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Hmm, I do have something I want to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would it be? That he would want to ask?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it about the Team 2 Leader? I probably had a lot to do with him suddenly deciding to go independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't tell me it's about the Chinese investment matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bothered me too because of what the Team 3 Leader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as I opened the door to the CEO's office, my mind was a tangled mess trying to figure out what the CEO's motives were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung was standing alone in front of a wall. The wall was full of profile pictures of celebrities at W&amp;amp;U. CEO Baek Hansung's finger lightly brushed past them. Neptune, Lee Songha, Nam Joyoon, Pretty Girls, and even the actors the Team 2 Leader was in charge of managing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you doing? Sit. You must be exhausted after coming back from your business trip to China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My shoulders reflexively stiffened when he mentioned China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I sat at an empty seat, CEO Baek Hansung came over. After experiencing some unexpected misfortune during the weekend and with the Team 2 Leader causing a ruckus, I had expected him to be different from normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I couldn't imagine CEO Baek Hansung's red face spouting curses as he jumped up and down, I at least thought his mood would be fiercer. He was the same as normal. What was he thinking behind his calm face?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a project titled 'Telepathy' amongst the scenarios, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amongst the projects brought to Lee Songha. The one with Director Cha Jaeho and Heo Kakyung as the lead. Don't you remember?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... I do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I churned my mind, going through my memories to keep up with this sudden topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a project we rejected because female lead's role didn't suit Lee Songha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember that I had discussed it with CEO Baek Hansung and the director before making a final decision to reject it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung was smiling when I gave him a puzzled look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is there a project you are thinking about for Lee Songha's next project?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a few decent ones, but we are looking through them with an open mind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, I actually owe Director Cha Jaeho a favor from a long time ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation was taking an unexpected direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I met Director Cha because he said he wanted to have a meal, but it seems like he's really interested in Lee Songha. He even said that they were willing to adjust a significant portion of the female lead's character if she agrees to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mind jolted awake. The matters regarding the Team 2 Leader and Chinese investments were completely swept from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was he saying he wanted us to go with that project for Lee Songha?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I quickly recalled the scenario and female lead. The scenario was fine. It was a well-structured action thriller. I had considered this project for a good while because Heo Kakyung, famous for his box-office appeal, had already signed on it. However, this wasn't a project where the female lead shined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female lead was simply someone with a pretty face and body who was the male lead's love interest. Even if it was a box-office success, all the attention would be focused on Heo Kakyung. How much would that character change through adjustments? It left a bitter taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't have any projects you are seriously considering, why not listen to them once more?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And if the talks do not go well..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then don't do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately raised my head. CEO Baek Hansung calmly said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A favor is a favor, but if there's a better project, then, of course, we should do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels like we're at the wrong party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung looked around with an awkward expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is the wrong party. Since it's the closing ceremony at a short film festival."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel like a lot of people are looking at us. Like, 'why are they here?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Guess they are fascinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this was a film event, most attendees were directors and production-related professions as well as actors. It was obvious that a girl group would stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also dressed up since it has been a while since they last posed in front of a photo wall. The short film festival's photo wall was plain compared to the red carpets of international film festivals. Throwing Neptune into the mix, they stood out like flamingos in a dance of cranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are cameras everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LJ suddenly wedged herself between Lee Songha and me. Being pushed aside, Lee Songha frowned. LJ lightly shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You had a scandal, so we need to be careful of any two-shots of you two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, keep apart from each other. In the wrong hands, a two-shot could become a love shot!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung joined in to support LJ. Lee Songha was pushed back two more steps. Her clear face was now starting to cloud over. Lee Taehee, who was swaggering behind us like she was taking a walk, comforted Lee Songha by patting her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh! Park Hweseung! Right, right? Oppa, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung stomped her feet when she saw the actor in front of the photo wall. I unwittingly laughed because it had been a while since I saw her act like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, our eyes met! He's coming over. What do I do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She fussed all on her own before becoming serious as she looked at her fellow members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can't make a fuss just because we're in front of a movie actor. Let's pass by while greeting him in a natural way. So that it's not embarrassing!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey, you're the only one causing a fuss. Is this your first time seeing a movie actor?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im Seoyoung shook her head at LJ's rebuke. Park Hweseung was like the celebrity of celebrities. He was an actor who barely made any appearances on TV and entertainment shows and was wholly focused on his acting career. It was difficult to see him outside of a film festival like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, my desire to ask for an autograph surged up my throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Hweseung walked up to us. His unkempt beard and unrefined appearance gave us the aura of a talented actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't have time to cause a fuss because we were next in front of the photo wall. We had a simple handshake before going our separate ways when I heard Park Hweseung talk with his manager from behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wow, I got to shake hands with a girl group. Aren't you jealous?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm soo jealous. Sell me your palm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That moment, Im Seoyoung's eyes popped with stars. She urgently shook my clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oppa, oppa, did you hear that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess we're popular with movie actors?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Probably popular amongst middle-aged men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chuckled as I sent the girls off in front of the cameras. The photo wall was instantly overwhelmed with camera flashes. Their reactions were not much different from Park Hweseung. People gathered around to see the girls as they were changing their poses according to the reporters' requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aren't you Team Leader Jung Sunwoo?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A middle-aged man came over in a friendly manner. His face looked familiar, but who was he? I looked through my memories and barely managed to remember. He was a production employee I had met at some ceremony. He glanced at the photo wall before asking,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of Neptune came?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since Songha is here as a presenter, they asked Neptune to perform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, I came over to find any good rookie directors..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employee glanced behind him. The people who had been following him like ducklings had been staring at me for a while. Having gathered their gazes once more, the production employee grabbed my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, say hello. You all know him, right? He's Team Leader Jung Sunwoo of W&amp;amp;U."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their eyes glistened. The employee introduced them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are the director and actors who submitted their project to a competition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder. Their appearances were excessively neat for them to be production company employees. I shook their hands with a smiling face. I took special care in observing the director. While he was a rookie director who hasn't debuted yet, he could be next year's rising star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the girls got out of the photo wall, we were introduced to and introduced ourselves endlessly. There were directors and actors, who were the main show tonight, as well as production and distribution company employees. There were even famous directors here to judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone's so good-looking. Particularly Ms. Im Seoyoung, you have a face meant for acting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were even directors selling snake oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Me? My face?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe it's because you're a singer, but your vocalization and expressions are good. You should act!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Me? There's no way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, having watched the scene that branded Im Seoyoung as an iconic figure for terrible acting, the director asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ms. Lee Taehee, are you not interested in acting?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Neptune was laughing and chatting, I mixed in with the directors and production companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard Director Jang Joonmo and Mr. Hweseung will be attending the afterparty. How about you, Team Leader Jung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, of course, we will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since all important discussions would happen there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard Ms. Son Chaeyoung will be doing a drama? She should do a movie. I have a decent project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Seo Jijoon seems quiet these days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard rumors that you were gathered a ton of scenarios and proposals. Did you find any decent projects?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always felt this, but rumors traveled quickly in this industry. It seemed like those who asked me about Seo Jijoon and Son Chaeyoung already knew about the incident with the Team 2 Leader. Their eyes stuck to me even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is the rumor about Ms. Lee Songha joining Telepath?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Telepathy? Director Chae's project? She's joining that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I forced my frowning brows straight. Rumors traveled fast, but gossip was even faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It hasn't been decided. We are still examining it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really? The investment distribution company was thinking that it was already decided."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess there was some miscommunication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or they purposely leaked that information. I guess I should set the meeting earlier. I'll listen to them, but if it isn't good, I needed to properly refuse this time. CEO Baek Hansung also said to find something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had now looked through most projects. I was now in the process of re-reading projects in case I missed something. It was now time to decide on a project, but I still couldn't make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was I expecting something too special? Did I have no choice but to pick one from my final choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ceremony began while I was still lost in my thoughts. Having finished their performance in front of the movie screen, the girls sat next to me. Winning projects were introduced, and unfamiliar directors and actors were mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was still lost in my thoughts as I clapped mechanically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Songha and Nam Joyoon were a given, but Seo Jijoon and Im Joowon needed new projects now. I wanted to get them something good. Since they readily sided with me, I wanted to get them good projects no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as I thought this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static filled my vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And my heart began to beat noisily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:27:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 193</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78574/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 193: A Way that Suited Me (5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello CEO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho greeted him with a bow. Then he greeted the director and me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Hello team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our eyes met during the short time we shook hands. Maybe it was because he became an upstart star beyond his expectations or because he had difficulty facing the CEO, but Song Inho looked tenser than normal. His hand was stiff and cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I put more strength into my grip, his mouth opened and closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's sit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader urged him. As if being sent aside, Song Inho sat in an empty seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood was quite peaceful. The director fussed and praised Song Inho's achievements. CEO Baek Hansung looked pleased as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How's work? I bet it's hectic since it's your first time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung asked. Before Song Inho could open his mouth, the Team 2 Leader replied,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said that it still feels surreal, but he's following very well. Now that we've made a good start, I've picked out a few dramas for his next project. I was planning on showing you some proposals when you had some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Drama?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to expose his face more through dramas before his popularity cools."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do you think? Do you have a project you're interested in?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung asked Song Inho. Once again, the Team 2 Leader replied for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Inho hasn't seen them yet. I decided to show him once I've narrowed it down to one or two choices. He doesn't have an eye for projects yet, so he might something strange if there are a lot of choices. Also, since he's already busy with other stuff, it'll only complicate things for him more if he looks at multiple projects. Isn't that what managers are for?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader added in a rambling manner. That it was all for Song Inho. He looked like the stereotypical image of a helicopter parent. Song Inho didn't just look exhausted, he looked lethargic. He wasn't the type to make such a gloomy expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung stared at Song Inho. He soon retracted his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mood reached its peak, the Team 2 Leader's shoulders spread wide as though they were waiting for this moment. He held his nose so high that he almost did a flip. His proud gaze fixated on me and the director. It looked like the appearance of a secret royal inspector. I guess Song Inho was like the royal badge?&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to contain it, the director clicked his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, Team 2 Leader, you really do have a good eye. I admit it. I'm sorry for doubting you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you like this all of a sudden? I'm blushing. Did I say anything?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's because of your prickly gaze. Narrow-minded fellow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader's face, which wore a content smile, crumbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Narrow-minded? Should we really bring everything up? To be honest, you've hurt me a lot. When I picked a rookie with my discerning eye, you asked me why I picked Inho over Nam Joyoon and whether I rejected him because Jung Sunwoo brought him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, really? When did I ever say that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's how you said it. There are even crazy employees who placed bets on Nam Joyoon and Inho. Didn't this all start with you? Inho, he must have suffered a lot of hardship by being unwittingly involved in this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director avoided his gaze when he brought up the bets. The Team 2 Leader's gaze was now directed at me. Although he wasn't openly putting on airs, his eyes were drunk with anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I said it before. To trust my discerning eye. Nam Joyoon isn't a bad actor. Only, if I had to pick one of them to be W&amp;amp;U's rising star, I judged that Inho had much more potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader proudly patted Song Inho's shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look. The results prove it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he was speaking to the director, his eyes were still on me. He raised his chin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team... Leader Jung, what do you think?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My thoughts?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you also thought that the reason I picked Inho over Nam Joyoon was for my own personal revenge. That's why you held a grudge against me. You acted so boastfully when Alive was released, but have your thoughts changed?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I scratched my chin before taking a sip of my now cooled coffee. The Team 2 Leader's gaze intently followed my face like he didn't want to miss a single change in my expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fully understood his feeling. This was probably the most refreshing and delightful moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He probably ground his teeth thinking of a way to screw me over since the meeting, and Song Inho happened to rise to prominence. He likely considered Song Inho as a priceless lucky charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much did he look forward to this moment? From igniting the public's interest in Song Inho, moving the press, until the title 'upstart star' was given to Song Inho. He likely waited for this moment as he added oil and fanned the flames the past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment he could show Song Inho off in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? You can't acknowledge it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to boost the Team 2 Leader's delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's true I held a grudge against your decision. I had thought that I inadvertently involved Joyoon hyung, Mr. Nam Joyoon, because you looked at me in a bad light."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest, I was partly right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I licked my lower lip and continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did, but I now acknowledge it. Your eye in picking Mr. Song Inho and your decision-making skills. The public is making a fuss about Song Inho right now, so there's no way I can't acknowledge it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I glanced in front of me, and the Team 2 Leader's eyes glimmered with joy. Almost as though I was on my knees, giving him the highest praise. His cheeks jiggled and beard trembled like he was barely holding back from laughing uproariously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this the Team 2 Leader's peak? Had he reached his peak?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I glanced at Song Inho before saying,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe he's a great actor with a lot of potential. To the point that I want him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the point you want him?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, he seems more desirable every time I see him. That's why... Please give him to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader made a dazed expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Give what?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Song Inho. I really want to work with him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What? You bastard? What kind of nonsense is that? Jung Sunwoo, are you crazy? Did you lend Inho to me? For you to ask me to give him to you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader wheezed out a laugh. I turned my gaze. Song Inho's eyes were wide open. The director was completely focused on the situation as if there was nothing more worth spectating that this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And CEO Baek Hansung was smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked happier now than he did looking at Song Inho, who was considered a rising star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I didn't lend him to you. It's similar. I did request the CEO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CEO?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader's gaze quickly turned. The air tensed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Request? CEO, what nonsense is he saying?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told Team Leader Jung that, if he could persuade Chaeyoung to sign onto another project, I would let him fill his team with whoever he wants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader jolted to his feet. The hair on his face stood straight from anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was curious. How it felt for the ground to collapse as soon as you reached the peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So? Don't tell me you're planning on snatching Inho and handing him over to him? What the hell kind of situation is this?! I picked and raised Inho! He's my child!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, with the 'child'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's only been a few days since you promoted him to team leader as a reward for succeeding a project! But what are you giving him for persuading Chaeyoung? If things are like this, shouldn't there be a reward for me, who made Inho W&amp;amp;U's rising star?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a bit different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director scratched the tip of his nose as he joined in,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then, since Team Leader Jung had huge hits with Royal Family and Alive early this year, should he be a director? The CEO had been waiting for an opportunity to promote him and simply used the project as a pretext. The CEO separately made a request regarding Chaeyoung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Still, this isn't right! Aren't you stabbing me in the back for him?! CEO, aren't you too biased? Isn't this why people in the company are spreading rumors about how he's your son?!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung laughed when he heard those words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are rumors like that? Team Leader Jung, how old are you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm twenty-nine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not impossible with a twenty-year difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung waved his hand at Team 2 Leader's outburst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calm down and sit. I won't split up good partners for no reason."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless the actor wants to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho's eyes widened once more. The Team 2 Leader's gaze alternated between CEO Baek Hansung, me, and Song Inho. Just as he was about to shout, the director nonchalantly said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you acting like this? Don't you remember how you and Chief Jo barged in and asked to manage Lee Songha? He said that he would think about it if Lee Songha agreed. If Chief Jo persuaded Lee Songha, then her manager might have long since changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director! This and that are completely...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's different about it? If Song Inho doesn't want to, then that's that. Why? Do you not trust your child?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a loss for words, the Team 2 Leader clenched his jaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now shall we hear what the person in question has to say?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung gestured at Song Inho. As more gazes focused on him, Song Inho clenched his fist, which had been quietly sitting on top of his knees. His fist was clenched so hard that his knuckles turned white. CEO Baek Hansung tilted his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was it too sudden? Do you need time to think about it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho opened his mouth but closed it once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something was off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent Song Inho a look that everything would be as he wanted with his reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as soon as his gaze met mine, his face distorted like someone who held all the worries in the world. His eyes reddened in an instant as tears dripped from his eyes. I had seen Song Inho cry a few times, but this was the saddest I've seen him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I raised my coffee cup. I tightened my grip on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could feel CEO Baek Hansung and the director's gazes on me. Asking me what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I was wondering that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did he have a change of heart? If that's the case...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Inho!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader hugged Song Inho's shoulders in a comforting manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you crying? It's okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shot a displeased glare at us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now really. How shocked and taken aback must he be to cry? He's still young. He was already stiff before coming to the CEO's office, do you think he won't be shocked being caught in the middle of the CEO and director?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He clicked his tongue before shooting me a gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Above all, Jung Sunwoo's a team leader. How can he not be cautious? Maybe if one was thick-skinned, but he's not so daring to reject an offer. He's too soft-hearted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His gaze landed on Song Inho in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's nothing much, so just speak what's on your mind. You just need to trust me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Team leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, it's fine-!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho spread his arms. The Team 2 Leader also spread his arms while smiling gently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, Song Inho hugged...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so rough that it felt like my bones were breaking. It felt like I was caught by a giant squid. I let out a breath and looked past Song Inho's shoulder. The Team 2 Leader still stood with his arms spread. He seemed to still be processing what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corners of my lips rose. I had been looking forward to this moment like the Team 2 Leader had before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment the Team 2 Leader's mood hit its peak before falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smiling, I patted Song Inho's trembling back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are you crying? Do you not want to work with me?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No! Of course, I want to work with you! I do, but..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Won't I be unable to be an actor anymore?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho said tearfully. His voice was of worry and resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are you saying? Why can't you be an actor?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Team 2 Leader raised me up this far. If I follow someone else, people might say I'm ungrateful. They say you won't be able to work if rumors like that spread since the entertainment industry is so small. If you want to act for a long time, you need to mark those words...!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah, the Team 2 Leader said that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho quickly nodded at my question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That moment, the Team 2 Leader, who had been blankly staring in our direction, crumbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here I was wondering if he had a change of heart. He had been waiting to work with me like a child at an orphanage waiting for his parents. I was wondering why he was acting like the world was ending rather than being happy. It seemed like his mind was filled with the Team 2 Leader's words, which were no different from a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lips unconsciously made a crooked smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't worry. I'll handle that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I patted Song Inho's back and looked at CEO Baek Hansung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO, can I tell you more actors I would like to bring over to my team? I have already gotten their agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Who? Son Chaeyoung?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung propped his chin up as he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, let's just consider it as me helping the Team 2 Leader whenever there is an issue with Ms. Son Chaeyoung. I'll feel really bad if I brought over W&amp;amp;U's poster star. I'm not that insolent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then who?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the Team 2 Leader's distorted face as I smiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Seo Jijoon and Mr. Im Joowon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{1}&lt;/sup&gt; Similar to an undercover cop revealing his badge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:26:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Top Management: Chapter 192</title><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/read/77713-top-management/chapter/78573/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 192: A Way that Suited Me (4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL: emptycube / ED: Isleidir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's see the top keyword of Celebrity Weekly!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video began to play at the anchor's remark. It was a scene of a young, barefoot man chasing after a woman. Park Taepyeong, who sat in the host chair, twirled around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do we really need to see that? I saw that clip a million times online."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just watch it again. It's okay to see good things a lot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A female singer, who was a member of the panel, watched the clip with pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young man was crying silently. His tears rolled down his clenched jaw. He stood still when the woman walking in front of him begged him to leave then would follow after her when she turned her back to leave. This happened until the woman disappeared like smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, as you all expected, the hot keyword is the upstart star, Mr. Song Inho!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pop culture critic looked at his cue cards as he briefed the audience,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a rookie who recently made his debut in the newly released mellow movie 'Love Again'. Love Again is about the female lead going to the past and meeting men who might have been her destined soulmate. Mr. Song Inho appeared as her college classmate. Also, his popularity soared immediately after the movie's release."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Isn't his popularity really amazing right now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people in the panel were noisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw the movie yesterday at the theatres, and women screamed when he came on screen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They say they go to the movies to see him rather than the movie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His popularity is so big that..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An excited entertainment news reporter tapped her cue card with her pen,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At their press screening, industry insiders predicted the movie's first-week score would be at most 900,000."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a huge hit too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, after Song Inho became viral on the internet, the movie is gaining a ton of viewers. Its first-week score has already passed 1.6 million. It's incredible. People are sending love calls to pick him up before his worth skyrockets any further."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People exclaimed in admiration. The anchor asked another question,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reporter Moon, what do you think is the reason behind Mr. Song Inho's popularity?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He really fit his character, Mujin, in the movie. A good-looking man from a wealthy, affluent family, who also has a lot of circumstances. On top of that, the movie ended in a happy ending, but Mujin's life was a tragedy. That tugged the audience's hearts even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Taepyeong joined in,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought the movie and actor were decent, but do they warrant such a big reaction?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a few cases where something becomes a hit beyond expectations. Mr. Heo Kakyung was unknown before instantly rising to stardom with a drama. Ms. Kwon Sori became a hit while making a parody for a 15-second commercial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment news reporter mentioned a few more cases while counting down with her fingers. The critic added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People commonly referred to these cases as fever, syndrome, etc."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then, professor, do you think Mr. Song Inho will reach the syndrome level?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pop culture critic shrugged at the anchor's question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's already close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should have gotten him on our show. As an upstart star special."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female singer commented outside what was on the script. Park Taepyeong snorted,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They probably did try but were rejected. There are likely tons of places that want him on their show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can't you call Mr. Song Inho?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Taepyeong blinked at her words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Me? I've never met him before!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But aren't you close with Mr. Jung Sunwoo of W&amp;amp;U? You posted a picture of you both on social media. Mr. Song Inho's also from W&amp;amp;U, so can't you somehow call him?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you think I can? Is Jung Sunwoo W&amp;amp;U's CEO? To be able to connect me to any of their actors?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park Taepyeong clicked his tongue. Understanding his gaze, the main producer raised his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll take a break here!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff went on set to prepare it for the next segment. Park Taepyeong took a few gulps of water before glancing at the female singer on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hey, tell me beforehand if you're going to ask me something not on the script! I was caught off guard!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, I just thought you could at least call him. Even if he became a sensation, he's still a rookie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We thought we could definitely bring him on the show because he's a rookie, but we were completely rejected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main producer said as he came over. The entertainment news reporter, who was fixing her makeup during the intermission, clicked her tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's not just any rookie. He's W&amp;amp;U's rookie. He's a potential talent, so I hear Team Leader Lee Jangyeob is personally managing him?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really? So he's been quiet recently because he was managing a rookie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who's Team Leader Lee Jangyeob? I only know the CEO and Jung Sunwoo from W&amp;amp;U."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anchor asked with a puzzled look. Soon, they began discussing the behind-the-scenes of the entertainment industry, which wasn't on the script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Jung Sunwoo became famous in the last few years, but Team Leader Lee Jangyeob was the one production companies would usually recall when thinking of W&amp;amp;U. He was known for having a good eye and great acumen. If you wanted an actor from W&amp;amp;U, you had to get through him first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But hasn't Jung Sunwoo reached that level now? I heard he's a team leader now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many rumors. That maybe you will have to go through Jung Sunwoo to cast a W&amp;amp;U actor. That you needed to get close to him before it's too late. However, those rumors have disappeared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment news reporter nodded her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yup, because Song Inho's doing so well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their hurried footsteps sounded out as they walked across a hallway that was as red as the red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Greet them respectful and match their reactions. It was hard getting this meeting, okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man said while turning around. A woman, whose thighs were clearly revealed under her skirt, nodded. Her face, where even her lashes were dolled up, flashed with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't worry, chief. I was just too nervous during the audition. I'm more comfortable with situations like this. Who do I have to get close with?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The director, production company rep, and the male lead, Heo Kakyung, as well as people from his company are inside. If you get close with the production company, at most, you'll get a brief role. You need to target the director and Heo Kakyung if you want a good role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman undid another button on her thin, see-through shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chief Choi! Over here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief hurried. In front of them, a man wearing a wrinkled dress shirt waved at them. He was the general manager of the movie production company. He said with a discourteous face,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can only introduce you. You need to mingle on your own, okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, that'll be enough. Our Hyojin will do the rest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief quickly pushed the actress forward. After giving her a glance, the general manager opened the door. The serious faces gathered in the room were in the middle of discussing something. Their voices quickly halted at the entrance of the uninvited guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general manager said in a smiling face,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Director, Mr. Kakyung, this is Ms. Lee Hyojin from Ant Entertainment. She just happened to be in a meeting in another room. She came over because she's a fan of you both. Come in, come in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hello, director! Sunbaenim!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actress greeted them while brushing her hair to the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I auditioned not too long ago, but I was so nervous I didn't properly introduce myself. I prepared a lot but was unable to show my true skill. It was constantly on my mind, and I begged to meet you when I heard you were here. Could I introduce myself briefly before going?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You just introduced yourself. Now you can go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director said. The actress stepped back at the chilly mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pardon?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I received your greeting so go. We are in the middle of an important discussion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man sitting in the middle smirked. His arrogance glimmered over his forthright, intellectual appearance. He was Heo Kakyung, who would be counted on anyone's fingers as one of the most popular male actors in their thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general manager hastily stopped the red-faced actress from greeting again. The producer from the production company, who was sitting on the sofa on the side, shook his stiff face. Belatedly noticing the serious atmosphere, the general manager chased the actress and chief out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heo Kakyung said in an unhurried tone,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The general manager seems to have a lot of free time. To bring an actress no one has heard of before here when we haven't cast our main female lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Kakyung, that's not it. We just happened to meet each other here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general manager smiled awkwardly. The director down the rest of his liquor and asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Kakyung, who do you want as the female lead?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I said it from the beginning. I want Lee Songha."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director let out a drunken sigh. The general manager said in a comforting manner,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Kakyung, it's not like we ignored your opinion, but talks with Ms. Lee Songha didn't go very well. I had three meetings with Chief Jung Sunwoo. Instead of Ms. Lee Songha, we could get better actress more suiting of your level..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"General manager."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heo Kakyung cut him off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If she doesn't want to do it, you need to make it so she does. Isn't that what a production company is supposed to do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general manager opened and closed his mouth a few times before sighing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Okay, I'll try to meet with Chief Jung Sunwoo once mor..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director cut him off this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the general manager's face was about to brighten, the director continued,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll talk with CEO Baek Hansung."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Inho! Congratulations on your movie!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho, who was walking mechanically, creaked to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ah... Thank you. But I think you already congratulated me yesterday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just wanted to congratulate you for a long time. As long as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The W&amp;amp;U Team 2 employee patted Song Inho's shoulder before disappearing. From then on, he received multiple congratulations. Team 2 had been in high spirits these days. It was thanks to people's reaction to Song Inho, which was better than they expected. Since the team leader's office was at peace, so was the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho took a deep breath in front of the team leader's office. The door burst open the moment he knocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader gave Song Inho a bear hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lucky Charm! That's what you are!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His voice was full of energy, like someone who had tasted a rain shower after a drought. Song Inho was that rain shower for the Team 2 Leader. He was a monsoon. Song Inho brought newfound vigor into his mind, which had been exhausted from his resentment towards Jung Sunwoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What did I tell you? Didn't I tell you that you would receive the rookie award in a brilliant fashion if you just did as I said? How do you feel now that you're famous?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song Inho opened and closed his mouth a few times before saying,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's still... feels surreal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll definitely hit you when you go about your schedule. How did your parents' react?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... They are happy. They go to the movies every night. They said they'll go watch it until the movie is no longer playing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really? I should send them enough tickets then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader led Song Inho to the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CEO is upstairs, so let's greet him first. He said he wanted to see you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CEO did?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He normally calls actors up and discusses projects with them. I bet he's particularly interested in you. There were a lot of rumors going around mentioning you with Jung Sunwoo, Nam Joyoon, and them. But that's all over now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader revealed a satisfied smile. As soon as they arrived at the sixth floor, the secretary approached them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CEO's inside, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is, but the meeting isn't over yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What meeting? Is the director inside?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, as well as Team Leader Jung Sunwoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Team 2 Leader's face changed the moment the words 'Jung Sunwoo' and 'Team Leader' came out of the secretary's mouth. He made an unpleasant expression like he just saw a pile of trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is he here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frowning, the Team 2 Leader suddenly looked back at Song Inho. Song Inho was staring at the CEO's office. Maybe it was because he was nervous or excited, but his lips were tense. On the other hand, the Team 2 Leader's face relaxed the moment he saw Song Inho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He immediately walked over to the CEO's office. His steps were steadfast like a triumphant general bringing his spoils of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CEO, this is the Team 2 Leader. I came with Inho."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... Mm. Come in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reply came after a slight delay. It was CEO Baek Hansung's voice. The Team 2 Leader looked behind him and gestured with his hand. Song Inho, who had been standing with a complicated expression, began walking mechanically. The Team 2 Leader placed his hand on his shoulder. Then he opened the CEO's office door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung turned over the contract. Then he nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As though he had been waiting for it, the director stretched his hand out to the contract. Then he checked the signature on the last page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Son Chaeyoung really did sign it. Lucky Charm, what did you do to her?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I persuaded her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director moved his seat over to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If she was someone who could calm down from persuasion, she would be sitting here with us. She doesn't come to the company unless she has business with you. Spill it. How did you persuade her that the words 'her people' came out of her mouth?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave the director, who pestered me to spill my secret, a bitter smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems Chaeyoung really likes you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I licked my dry lips. Then I went to the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since she decided her next project, can we continue the 'team' discussion from before?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director, who had been mumbling to himself, shut his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising his cup of coffee, CEO Baek Hansung smiled faintly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You said you had someone you wanted to bring over?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And you got the person's agreement?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was about to reply when someone knocked on the door. Then I heard the Team 2 Leader's voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mm. Come in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The door burst open as soon as CEO Baek Hansung replied. Then the Team 2 Leader entered with his arm wrapped around Song Inho's shoulder. In that short moment, both their gazes met mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Baek Hansung said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good timing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, good timing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;/ /&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false" /><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:26:25 +0000</pubDate></item></channel><link>https://www.scribblehub.com/favicon.ico</link><description>Top Management</description></rss>
